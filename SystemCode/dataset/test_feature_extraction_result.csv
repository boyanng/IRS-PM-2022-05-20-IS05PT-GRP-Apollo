The Terminal High Altitude Area Defense System, made by Lockheed Martin, took out the midrange ballistic missile used to attack an Emirati oil facility near Al-Dhafra Air Base, according to two sources granted anonymity because they are not authorized to speak about the UAE’s activities. The Emirati base hosts U.S. and French forces.

The attack, which used cruise missiles, ballistic missiles and drones, killed three civilians and wounded six others, UAE’s ambassador to the United States, Yousef Al Otaiba, said earlier in the week.

“Several attacks, a combination of cruise missiles, ballistic missiles and drones, targeted civilian sites in the UAE. Several were intercepted, a few of them [weren’t], and three innocent civilians unfortunately lost their lives,” Al Otaiba said at a virtual event sponsored by the Jewish Institute for National Security of America.

The Emirati Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The UAE was a key member of the Saudi-led coalition that entered Yemen’s civil war in 2015, after the Houthis had overrun Yemen’s capital of Sanaa the previous year and ousted the country’s president from power. Although the UAE has largely withdrawn forces from the conflict, it remains heavily involved in the war and supports local militias on the ground in Yemen.

U.S. Central Command on Friday confirmed “a potential inbound threat” had forced U.S. service members at Al-Dhafra into their bunkers, in a “heightened alert posture” for about 30 minutes Sunday night. Airmen were directed to keep their protective gear close for 24 hours afterwards.

“Everything was professional and disciplined. The ‘all clear’ was called at 9:27 p.m. local time,” said Capt. Bill Urban, a spokesman for the command. “There was no mission impact.”

Lockheed Martin declined to comment.

THAAD, which is designed to counter short-, medium- and long-range ballistic missiles, was initially developed in the 1990s. It struggled in early testing, but has had a consistent reliability track record in flight tests since Lockheed Martin in 2000 won the development contract to turn THAAD into a mobile tactical army fire unit.

By 2019, the Missile Defense Agency had demonstrated the capability for the THAAD system to remotely fire an interceptor following 16 consecutive successful intercept tests.

The U.S. has deployed THAAD throughout the world, including to Guam, Israel, South Korea and Japan. In 2017, Saudi Arabia agreed to buy THAAD in a deal thought to be worth up to $15 billion. The UAE was the first foreign customer for the system and trained its first units in 2015 and 2016.

The Army operates seven THAAD batteries, but has long had a requirement to field nine total. The MDA has lacked the funding to build the final two, but U.S. lawmakers added funding in the fiscal 2021 budget to build an eighth THAAD battery.

The Houthis have used drones and missiles to attack Saudi Arabia and oil targets in the Persian Gulf over the course of Yemen’s war, now in its eighth year. Monday’s attack was the UAE’s first acknowledgement of being hit by the Houthis. Several civilians have died in Saudi Arabia from cross-border Houthi attacks.

This week, Abu Dhabi asked the U.S. for help bolstering its defenses against missiles and drones and halting weapons from being transported to the Houthis, according to a statement the UAE’s Embassy in Washington posted to Twitter.

In a call Wednesday between Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan and U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, Austin “underscored his unwavering support for the security and defense of UAE territory against all threats.” The Pentagon has since declined to provide specifics about the UAE’s request.

Abu Dhabi was also consulting with congressional gatekeepers on U.S. arms sales this week. The embassy said Al Otaiba met Wednesday with House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y.

Ahead of Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Robert Menendez’s meeting with Al Otaiba, Menendez said, “We’ll see what their request is. I certainly recognize some of the challenges they’re having.”

Congressional aides said lawmakers have generally been open to Abu Dhabi’s requests for weapons to defend against Houthi attacks, but Emirati officials are likely to face questions over the country’s growing ties to China and accusations its forces have intervened in Libya’s ongoing war.

U.S. officials would also have to consider the suitability and production schedules for the equipment Abu Dhabi is requesting, according to a Senate aide granted anonymity to talk about diplomatically sensitive arms sale talks. If the UAE is seeking Patriot missiles, there’s reportedly an interceptor shortage fueled by Houthi drone and rocket attacks against Saudi Arabia.

“The Saudis are using up their Patriots at a good clip, and these things, you don’t just pick them up at Walmart,” the aide said. “The Emiratis could be asking for things very appropriately, but before anything comes from it and arrives in country, it could be years.”

Gulf Arab states, as well as the U.S., U.N. experts and others, have previously accused Iran of supplying arms to the Houthis, a charge Tehran denies.

Bilal Saab, a former Pentagon official now at the Middle East Institute, said the Houthis’ use of missiles suggests Iranian involvement, even after diplomatic talks in December between Iranian and Emirati officials in Tehran.

”Clearly those talks were ineffective,” Saab said. “The very use of ballistic missiles signals to me that the Iranians knew about it, were on board or at least had a role.”

President Joe Biden said Wednesday his administration, following the strikes, is considering restoring the Houthis to the U.S. list of international terrorist organizations.

Al Otaiba had urged the move, and the Emirati Embassy welcomed it in a statement that said, “Case is clear — launching ballistic and cruise missiles against civilian targets, sustaining aggression, diverting aid from Yemeni people.”

5,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/nft-art-sales-are-booming-just-artists-permission-rcna10798,NFT art sales are booming. Just without some artists' permission.,"Digital thieves had stolen from Aja Trier before.

Trier, a painter in San Antonio, often riffs on Vincent van Gogh’s “Starry Night,” adding dogs or dinosaurs to it, or reimagining it as a desert landscape or Mordor from “Lord of the Rings.” She sells versions on mugs and mouse pads and pillows, and over the years she’s caught and stopped people selling pirated versions of her work on Amazon and other online marketplaces.

But thanks to the explosion of the NFT art market, thieves have started stealing her work at a jaw-dropping rate. Last week, an unidentified user on OpenSea, the dominant marketplace for the burgeoning NFT art market, started putting tens of thousands of listings of her work, often duplicates, up for sale. Thirty-seven of them sold before she was able to convince the platform to take them down.

“They just kept taking and remaking them as NFTs,” Trier said. “It’s so flagrant. And if it happens to me, it can happen to anyone.”

Trier’s story has already become common in the burgeoning world of NFT art sales. RJ Palmer, a San Francisco artist who designs creatures and monsters both as commissioned digital works and for movies and video game companies, said issuing takedown requests to NFT platforms for his work became a daily routine before he eventually gave up.

“It got to be too many. It became this part of my day,” Palmer said, adding that he would constantly send emails trying to get NFTs taken down. “This is putting so much work on me. I just don’t want to deal with it.”

As the NFT art market takes off, systems to ensure a buyer is making a legitimate purchase of digital ownership have failed to keep up. Anonymous thieves now regularly steal whatever digital art they can find online and pass it off as their own to sell. While NFT proponents tout the technology as a way to revolutionize arts patronage, the rapidly growing digital marketplaces that enable those sales have so far done little to stop that piracy.

NFTs, short for nonfungible tokens, have exploded as a new kind of art market in the past two years, promising a way for people to prove they own a digital asset. Rooted in the same blockchain technology as cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, NFTs have been called everything from “a geeky implementation of bragging rights” to digital certificates of authenticity.

Actors, musicians, athletes and even political campaigns have jumped into the space, issuing all manner of NFT-connected digital knickknacks. NFT trading volume grew rapidly, hitting $10.7 billion in the third quarter of 2021, according to analytics platform DappRadar.

In the art world, NFTs were quickly hyped as solving a variety of problems. They offered a way for artists to monetize digital art, ensure they could sell their work and even make money if their art were sold in the future. NFTs are not art themselves but rather digital deeds, certificates that can be associated with a piece of art and then bought and sold as representative of ownership.

But rapid growth has also opened the door for rampant piracy and fraud. On most NFT platforms including OpenSea, by far the largest NFT marketplace, people can create an account and start selling whatever digital images they want to upload. While that’s helped OpenSea grow rapidly (the company announced Tuesday it had been valued at $13.3 billion in a recent funding round), the platform is barely moderated, forcing artists to actively patrol OpenSea and its competitors to try to get their work taken down.

In an emailed statement, an OpenSea spokesperson said, “We take theft seriously and have policies in place to meet our obligations to the community and deter theft on our platform,” and the company is “actively expanding our efforts across customer support, trust and safety, and site integrity.”

While there is little data to illustrate exactly how common the problem is, there are some indications it’s widespread. One comes from DeviantArt, one of the internet’s largest digital art platforms, which has started constantly scanning blockchains used by NFTs to alert users when copies of their work are shown on NFT exchanges. DeviantArt has sent alerts to thousands of artists since September, Liat Gurwicz, the company’s chief marketing officer, said.

“Art theft is nothing new. We’re just seeing it at a completely new scale with everything that’s happened with NFTs,” Gurwicz said. Artists have to take matters into their own hands to get their work taken down, she said.

“Right now, we are not aware of other solutions that artists can use,” she said.

Currently, OpenSea’s process to take down sales of stolen images puts most of the onus on the artists. A seller doesn’t need to provide proof of ownership or use their real name to start an auction, but an artist filing a copyright notice has to share personal information like their real name and links that prove they’re the real owner of a work.

Ashli Weiss, a Silicon Valley lawyer who has published a guide for how to send copyright notices to NFT marketplaces, said the burden on artists is exacerbated by the fact that many NFT thieves appear to be automated bots.

“These bots are not looking just for NFT art that’s already been minted and they’re trying to resell it,” Weiss said. “They’re going after artists who don’t even know what an NFT is, and that honestly is probably making the counterfeit sellers a lot more money because they don’t have people taking their work down.”

Even though OpenSea tends to respond to takedown requests, the actual idea of copyright in the NFT space is tricky, said Brian Frye, a professor of intellectual property law at the University of Kentucky who has sold his own art as NFTs.

Since an NFT isn’t an actual image, but rather a receipt or digital deed that points to an image, its sale wouldn’t violate an artist’s copyright, he said. Only the image uploaded to and hosted on OpenSea would.

“All [an NFT] is, is a URL saying ‘Look at this place on the internet,’” Frye said.

“Telling somebody to look at this URL, there’s no copyright infringement there, because no original copyright-protected element of anything is being copied,” he said. “So the NFT itself is just irrelevant to the question.”","But thanks to the explosion of the NFT art market, thieves have started stealing her work at a jaw-dropping rate.

The 38-year-old grabbed a double against Liechtenstein on Thursday and scored twice more in Luxembourg to extend his record tally of international goals to 122 in 198 appearances.

Joao Felix, Bernando Silva, Otavio and Rafael Leao added the other goals to put Portugal top of Group J after an easy start to their qualifying campaign.

New coach Roberto Martinez restored Ronaldo to the starting line-up last week and kept faith with him for the match in Luxembourg, where it took only nine minutes for the veteran superstar to open the scoring as he touched home Nuno Mendes’s soaring header.

Joao Felix doubled the lead in the 15th minute, rising high to get onto the end of Silva’s cross. Silva then himself headed home a powerful effort three minutes later after being set up by Joao Palhinha.

Bruno Fernandes set up Ronaldo for the fourth, just past the half hour mark, with a ball over the defence that was finished with pin-point accuracy.

Luxembourg looked bedraggled in the first half but offered more resistance after the break before Rafael Leao’s looping cross allowed fellow substitute Otavio to head home Portugal’s fifth.

Ruben Neves, yet to score for Portugal, struck the crossbar with a 83rd minute freekick before a penalty was awarded straight after when Luxembourg captain Laurent Jans tripped Rafael Leao.

The AC Milan forward got up off the turf to take the kick but his effort was saved by Luxembourg keeper Anthony Moris.

On March 14, the Minister of State for Health said cancer cases in India will cross the 15 lakh mark by 2025. A research paper published by the Indian Council of Medical Research in December last year estimated that cancer cases are likely to increase from 14.6 lakh in 2022 to 15.7 lakh in 2025 in India. In the last decade, cancer cases have risen from around 10 lakh in 2012 to 14.6 lakh in 2022 (Chart 1).

While increasing disease burden is a concern, the economic burden is equally a worry given that cancer treatment is among the most expensive compared to other diseases. A Parliamentary Standing Committee report on cancer, released in September 2022, expressed concern about the “inaccessible and increasing cost of cancer treatment.” For instance, according to the National Sample Survey (NSS) 2017-18 report, the average medical expenditure per hospitalisation case for cancer treatment was Rs. 68,259 in urban areas (Chart 2). The average expenditure for cardiovascular disease, the second-most expensive disease on the list, was Rs. 47,788. The Committee said that while anti-cancer medicine costs can be regulated, the cost of treatment also depends on other expenditures such as radiotherapy. Radiotherapy machines are not manufactured in India and are therefore expensive. It said that the cost of radiotherapy cannot be regulated as it has not been declared an essential service.

Chart 2

Notably, a significant share of medical costs is incurred by patients in India due to relatively poor insurance penetration. According to the NSS 2017-18 report, more than 80% of hospital bills are paid out of pocket. Chart 3 shows the average medical expenditure and average out-of-pocket expenditure per hospitalisation case as per the NSS report.

Chart 3

While comparison data post the implementation of Ayushman Bharat, an insurance scheme launched in 2018, are not yet available, the Committee observed that doctors’ “entire prescription and latest cancer therapies were not covered in the scheme.” It also said that many diagnostic tests are not covered. And given that initial investigations can be “very expensive, it leads to delay in treatment.”

The Committee observed that some State-specific insurance schemes have been highly beneficial to the community at large, and suggested a convergence of State and Central schemes. Its observations are accurate as the cost of cancer treatment does vary widely across States. Chart 4 shows the State-wise average medical expenditure incurred per hospitalisation case for cancer treatment in government hospitals as per NSS 2017-18. The chart shows that expenditure was lowest in Tamil Nadu and Telangana (with less than Rs. 1,000 spent per case) followed closely by Andhra Pradesh. This is an outcome of existing State-specific insurance schemes. While expenditure was highest in the northern and northeastern parts of India, the central, eastern, and western States were middling.

Chart 4

The NSS data also show that 153 per 1 lakh people in the 45-59 age group and 300 per 1 lakh in the 60-69 age group reported hospitalisation due to cancer (Chart 5). This shows that cancer often strikes around the retirement age of an earning member, which leads to a mounting debt burden.

Chart 5

The data also show that the average hospital stay of 14.1% of cancer patients was more than 30 days in India, while on average, only 2.3% of patients stay in the hospital for that long (Chart 6). As longer stays lead to higher bills, cancer is indeed an expensive disease to treat.

10,10,https://calgary.ctvnews.ca/frustration-grows-over-u-of-l-faculty-strike-1.5787974,Frustration grows over U of L faculty strike,"LETHBRIDGE -

Despite the cooler temperatures, University of Lethbridge faculty members were back on the picket line today for the eighth straight day.

Over the past week, the U of L faculty association (ULFA) has reached out to the board of governors to go back to the bargaining table but says they aren’t responding.

“We’ve invited them to meet and discuss (a new deal), they said they didn’t feel like it was necessary. We wrote to them again, I believe two days ago, saying how about today, Friday morning, and we're told they also don't see that it’s necessary,” said Dan O’Donnell, president of the University of Lethbridge Faculty Association.

ULFA says they have sent in new offers to the U of L board of governors, but the two groups haven’t been able to come to an agreement.

“We actually sent them articles, proposal articles for discussion, we've signalled areas where we're flexible and willing to compromise. We're looking to get a deal and get this settled, but we haven't seen that reciprocated,” said Locke Spencer, lead negotiator for ULFA.

Under ULFA’s latest offer, faculty would not see an increase in the first two years of the contract. They’d receive a 1.25 per cent raise in year three, 1.5 per cent in year four, with the possibility of an extra 0.5 per cent.

“Also included in that is a one time increase of pay of $2,600 recognizing the erosion we've seen over the past years in compensation and also recognizing that, that kind of better approves things for people at the lower end of the pay scale than those at the top,” said Spencer.

Faculty members went on strike on Feb. 10, resulting in classes being cancelled for the time being, which is having an effect on some students.

In a statement from the U of L, it reads in part:

The university is committed to a collective agreement that meets our primary responsibility to offer students top-quality education and programming while ensuring the long-term financial sustainability of the institution.

Faculty salaries at the University of Lethbridge have risen 34 per cent in the last decade. We also have to reconcile any new faculty increases with the needs of our non-academic staff, many of whose salaries have been frozen since 2015.

The statement goes on to say, “current offers from the faculty association do not allow us to meet our goals for sustainability and quality education for students.”

A solidarity rally was held on Friday, featuring guest speakers, speeches and open mic performances. Roughly 150 faculty members, students and community members attended.

O’Donnell says faculty members will remain on the picket line until an agreement is reached.

“There's only so much you can do. One side can show up at the table, but unless the other side is there, we don't get a settlement,” said O’Donnell.

The ULFA says on average, strikes in the post-secondary sector tend to last approximatively 21 days.

11,11,https://insideclimatenews.org/news/25022022/panama-rights-of-nature/,"Panama Enacts a Rights of Nature Law, Guaranteeing the Natural World’s ‘Right to Exist, Persist and Regenerate’","Panama is the latest country to recognize the legal rights of nature, giving environmentalists a new tool to fight ecological harm.

After just over a year of debate in Panama’s National Assembly, President ​​Laurentino Cortizo signed legislation on Thursday that defines nature as “a unique, indivisible and self-regulating community of living beings, elements and ecosystems interrelated to each other that sustains, contains and reproduces all beings.”

The legislation includes six paragraphs of rights extended to nature, including the “right to exist, persist and regenerate its life cycles,” the “right to conserve its biodiversity,” and the “right to be restored after being affected directly or indirectly by any human activity.”

Panama now joins Bolivia, New Zealand, Bangladesh, Ecuador, Brazil, Colombia and Mexico, among other countries, which have either issued court decisions, enacted laws or amended constitutions recognizing the legal rights of nature. Panama’s law will go into effect one year after it is published in the country’s Official Gazette.

The legislation also imposes new obligations on Panama’s government, including a requirement that its plans, policies and programs respect the rights of nature. It instructs the government to develop manufacturing processes and energy policies that safeguard ecosystems, and it requires the government to promote the rights of nature as part of its foreign policy.

Juan Diego Vásquez Gutiérrez, Panama’s youngest congressman at 25, sponsored the law and said that the legislation will make it easier to protect the environment because it grants legal standing to people and organizations to enforce the rights of nature.

“For a country so rich in biodiversity like Panama, taking care of nature is a step in the right direction,” he said. “It will open up economic opportunities, like in Costa Rica, for tourism involving nature and for sustainable development.”

The idea that nature, like humans, corporations and governments, should have legal rights emanates from the world view of some Indigenous cultures as well as the “deep ecology” movement of the 1970s. Panama’s legislation states that the country ​​recognizes the close relationship between the rights of nature and the beliefs of its Indigenous peoples and “will promote the incorporation of their ancestral knowledge in the interpretation and implementation of rights and obligations contained in this Law.”

The view holds that all living beings, not just humans, have intrinsic value and that humans are interconnected with the natural world. The belief contrasts with the utilitarian ethos, popular in industrialized nations, that nature exists to serve humankind and that humans have the right to commodify and, at times, destroy ecosystems.

Proponents of the rights of nature movement attribute ecological crises like climate change and biodiversity loss to the mindset and legal instruments that treat nature as human property subject to exploitation. Critics of the movement argue that rights of nature laws will stop all development activity and harm economies. In places like Ecuador, where rights of nature laws have been put into place, court rulings have struck down some permits for extractive activity and required restoration of ecosystems harmed by development. But, development activity has, for the most part, continued. In Panama’s three legislative debates over the rights of nature bill, no real opposition emerged, according to Vásquez.

Panama, famous for its canal separating Central and South America, is rich in biodiversity, with vast swaths of tropical rainforests and mangroves that are home to over ten thousand species of plants and animals like jaguars and the spectacled bear. Areas like the Darién and Veraguas regions are also home to Indigenous peoples. But those areas have been under threat from development and extractive activity.

From 2002 to 2020, the country, about half the size of Pennsylvania, lost about 194,000 acres of humid tropical forest, one of the most biologically diverse types of forest, according to Global Forest Watch. That is an area about four and a half times as large as Washington, D.C.

“Panama is one of the 25 most megadiverse countries globally, playing a pivotal role in preserving biodiversity and mitigating climate change,” said Constanza Prieto Figelist, Latin American legal director at the Earth Law Center, which helped draft the legislation. “The approval of this Law is fundamental because it joins the efforts of Colombia and Ecuador to recognize the rights of nature, creating a conservation corridor in the region that opens the doors for holistic and joint governance of forests, rivers, and the ocean.”

The law was originally proposed by a marine biologist and National Geographic Explorer, Callie Veelenturf, who had been studying sea turtles in Panama’s Pearl Islands archipelago. Worried about threats to endangered species, she approached Vásquez and Panama’s first lady, Yazmín de Cortizo, with a proposal for national legislation.

Veelenturf, who is from Massachusetts but lives in Panama, said she had no background or experience in environmental law and policy, and that she drew on her fieldwork experience as well as rights of nature laws from other countries.

“I had no expectations, but simply tried to bring compelling visuals of threats facing nature from the field, political arguments, and powerful statistics to the table,” Veelenturf, 29 and founder of the Leatherback Project and Rights for Nature, said. “I hope that increasingly everyday citizens that have a knowledge of the threats facing biodiversity will not be intimidated by the legal system and will speak up to propose new laws protecting nature.”","Panama is the latest country to recognize the legal rights of nature, giving environmentalists a new tool to fight ecological harm.

Just over three months later they went down 2-1 to Morocco in Tangiers -- a 2-1 debut win for the Moroccans over Brazil and a wonderful way for the Atlas Lions to enjoy the party they were hosting to celebrate reaching the semifinals in Qatar.

From a Brazil point of view, though, this is emphatically not a disaster, a disgrace, an embarrassment or any of the other terms that are commonly used when the national team are defeated.

Morocco had their World Cup team on parade. Brazil's line up featured seven members of the Qatar squad, just four of whom began the fateful quarterfinal against Croatia. If Morocco were at full strength, Brazil hardly have the means at the moment to define full strength; they are in a strange phase. While they wait for the next coach to step in (with Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti on top of the wishlist), Under-20 manager Ramon Meneses was in charge, almost certainly for this game only. His squad selection was somewhat idiosyncratic; promotion for five of his U20 squad, and some names surprisingly left out, chief among them Gabriel Martinelli and Bruno Guimaraes. The accusation that he has not been watching their games is surely justified. Meneses had his hands full with the punishing schedule of the South American Under-20 Championships but it barely matters as his choices are hardly definitive. The new coach will have his own preferences. Against Morocco, then, Brazil were hardly starting a new cycle. But neither were they just going round in circles. There is always something to learn from high pressure games -- and this, with a big, exhilarated crowd in the stadium, surely counts as one of those.

Given the scratch nature of the team, Brazil were probably better collectively than could have been expected. Their high press was sufficiently organised to cause Morocco some problems and turn goalkeeper Yassine Bounou into a gibbering wreck. So reliable in Qatar, now Bounou looked a constant danger to his own team, with poor passes and ill-judged lunges off his line. Brazil enjoyed the best of the first half hour, especially with occasional quick combinations of Vinicius Junior, Rodrygo and Lucas Paqueta. One such move ended with Paqueta sliding a pass to set up Rony, whose panicky shot went over.

Otherwise, though, Rony left a good impression on his debut. He is an interesting gnat-like striker, well developed by Palmeiras coach Abel Ferreira from an erratic winger to a versatile figure capable of operating wide, in the penalty area or work back down the flanks. As a late developer -- he is approaching 28 -- he is too old in today's market to attract interest from top European clubs. But he did enough on debut to suggest that he might have an international future.

On the half hour, though, Morocco struck. The best of their team is the quick little exchanges they play from the flanks, and one such move broke the deadlock. Not for the first time the defensive deficiencies of Brazil right-back Emerson Royal were exposed. He was caught in possession, and Sofiane Boufal played a clever one-two with Bilal El Khannouss before shooting home deftly on the turn.

Brazil were worth their equaliser some 25 minutes from time, even if it needed some collaboration from the Morocco keeper. Switched to the right of the midfield trio, Paqueta played a disguised square pass to Casemiro on the edge of the area. The shooting position did not look great, and neither was the shot, but it squirmed through Bounou and over the line.

As the second half turned into a parade of substitutes, there was a danger that some intensity might be taken out of the game. But Morocco wanted to send their fans home happy and won the game just after a short pause for a floodlight dip. It was a combination of three replacements. Playing out under pressure, Brazil lost the ball to left-back Yahya Attiyat-Allah, and his cross was chested down by Walid Cheddira for a gloriously emphatic volley from Abdelhamid Sabiri.

Brazil went 4-2-4 in a bid to get back level, but as a number of top European teams found out in Qatar, Morocco are a tough nut to crack, and played out time until the fans greeted the final whistle with an explosion of joy.

But assuming Meneses leaves a report for his permanent successor, some positive aspects from the Selecao's performance might well be included.

With the possible exception of the decisive goal, Eder Militao gave a sound performance in his first game as Brazil's senior centre-back. Teenage midfielder Andrey Santos was not overawed on debut, nor, as we have seen, was Rony. In the uncertainty over the international future of Neymar, Vinicius seems happy with the responsibility of becoming the team's most potent attacking threat, and his Real Madrid teammate Rodrygo comes up with enough little moments to keep the hope alive that he will become the brains of the attack.

It would appear that both Madrid stars would be happy to see their club coach become their national team boss -- and so now the task of Brazil's FA president is to talk Ancelotti into taking the job.","Brazil's line up featured seven members of the Qatar squad, just four of whom began the fateful quarterfinal against Croatia.

15,15,https://healthcare.utah.edu/publicaffairs/news/2022/03/heart-disease-research-nomination,A Heartfelt Campaign to Raise Awareness and Promote Research into Heart Disease,"

Nelangi Pinto, MD, was nominated for the AHA'S Women of Impact award by the mother of one of her pediatric heart patients.

It is campaign season for one doctor at University of Utah Health. She is using her nomination for the American Heart Association’s Utah Woman of Impact award to promote a platform which stresses advanced research and increased awareness about the dangers of heart disease. Nelangi M. Pinto, MD, a pediatric cardiologist at U of U Health, is passionate about her work with two of the most vulnerable groups of patients when it comes to heart disease.

""In addition to increasing awareness about heart disease in women, in my role I think it is critically important to talk about the heart defects a baby can be born with,"" said Pinto. Congenital heart disease is the leading cause of infant illness and death from birth defects and cardiovascular disease is the #1 cause of death for new moms. These are alarming statistics that affect every aspect of Pinto’s practice.

In recent years, Pinto became more aware of the American Heart Association’s (AHA) ""Go Red"" campaign to promote women’s heart health and she has fully embraced it. ""I think that was kind of a natural jump for me to say, ‘yes of course, we need to recognize how important it is to make sure moms are cognizant of their own health and risk.’ Pregnancy is a higher-risk period for a woman because they are asking their heart to do a ton more than it normally does for the growing fetus,"" said Pinto.

As a pediatric cardiologist and researcher, Pinto had already established a strong relationship with the AHA. The association has supported her work and that of her colleagues at U of U Health with several research grants. She told us that, ""One of the AHA grants we received is helping us to look at the impact of a heart defect, not just on the baby but on the entire family. So, our job as fetal doctors is not just taking care of the fetus, we are taking care of the family and especially the mom, trying to make sure we are supporting them through this whole process.""

Although it was unexpected, Pinto was excited to be nominated for the AHA’s Women of Impact award by the mother of one of her pediatric heart patients. Her focus is much less on winning and more on the opportunity to promote greater awareness of women’s heart health issues and raise the funds to ensure that message is spread locally and nationally. Pinto has assembled a team of friends, colleagues, and other community members to help her efforts. Pinto’s fellow nominee is a woman she greatly admires, a survivor of a life-threatening cardiovascular event at age 37.

The eight-week campaign to earn the official recognition began on Friday, February 4 and ends on Thursday, April 7 when the nominee whose team makes the largest impact in Utah will be named the Woman of Impact Award winner. Two weeks into the drive, Pinto already describes the experience as rewarding. She said, ""The advocacy part of this campaign, I feel like I’m learning a lot, and like we are making a difference. I’ve always been interested in public health and really improving the whole population’s health and so this is a great way for me to get involved.""","Nelangi Pinto, MD, was nominated for the AHA'S Women of Impact award by the mother of one of her pediatric heart patients.

16,16,https://www.eco-business.com/news/24-hours-with-global-wind-energy-council-asia-head-liming-qiao/,24 hours with… Global Wind Energy Council Asia head Liming Qiao,"Liming Qiao’s job is evangelising about the benefits of wind energy.

As Asia head for the Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC), a Brussels-headquartered trade association for the wind power industry, she spends much of her time trying to convince government officials to weave wind into their energy plans in a region still heavily reliant on fossil fuels.

Asia is home to about a third of the world’s wind capacity, with the majority in Qiao’s home country, China. But the region’s wind potential is projected to increase ninefold by 2050 as energy-hungry countries such as Vietnam ramp up their wind capacity, under pressure to transition to renewables from polluting coal.

Qiao has worked in the field of climate and energy since 2003. Prior to joining GWEC, she spent three years as programme coordinator at World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) in Beijing, leading climate programmes. She moved to GWEC in 2008, first based in Brussels as policy director, then in Beijing as China director. She was appointed Singapore-based head of Asia in February last year.

Here’s how her typical working day plays out:

7am: I have two kids, one is in pre-school, the other in primary school. I get up early to prepare their breakfast and send them to school. I will then head home or go to the office. Working from home is increasingly practiced in Singapore as the result of the Covid-19 outbreak, but it has been in our DNA for a long time. We usually only go to the office once or twice a week.

9am: Open my inbox with a cup of tea. I note down important updates and new tasks to add to my to-do list. I browse the headlines of industry news updates and bookmark important content to read later during my free time.

One email is from our partner in Vietnam, who shares news on the recent Power Development Plan 8 (PDP8) draft update. Vietnam’s onshore wind target has been raised to 20 gigawatts (GW) by 2030 and offshore wind to 5GW. In the past few months, we have been working really hard to push for a higher wind energy target in the PDP8 draft. We had workshops, meetings with government agencies, including the Prime Minister Pham Minh Chin in Glasgow at the COP26 climate negotiations. I’m thrilled to see more ambition to match the country’s net-zero target by 2050, announced in December.

10am: Zoom meeting with the Asia team. With minimum face-to-face interaction, we dedicate at least half an hour each day for an informal catch-up. We update each other on the progress we’re making. Working in a lean team managing Southeast Asia and East Asia means that all five of us must wear multiple hats.

“ We need to remember that the energy transition has not been fully embraced in Southeast Asia — coal still dominates the system.

10:30am: Jump into work. This is the time of year for planning. We have a call with one of our event partners, the European Chamber of Commerce Taiwan, to go through the plan for the Global Offshore Wind Summit Taiwan, an event we’ve been running since 2019. Due to the pandemic, it was changed to a half-day hybrid event last year, but we hope to expand it with more offerings for our sponsors and attendees this year.

Taiwan is one of our priority markets. We host regular policy meetings with the Ministry of Transportation and Communications, Ministry of Economic Affairs, and our member companies to discuss concern over requirements for local content in offshore wind tenders and the need to upgrade port infrastructure for wind farm construction. Taiwan is a pioneer in offshore wind and a case study in how to start a new renewable energy industry from scratch. It had the right policies in place to kickstart the industry, and was open to the global market, bringing in investment, talent and technologies in a short period of time.

12pm: Lunch. When working from home, I make a quick sandwich and eat it on the balcony while taking in some Vitamin D. When in the office, all of us get takeaways from various restaurants and eat together.

1pm: Dial into a call with Mark Hutchinson, chair of the GWEC Southast Asia taskforce (SEATF), a working group focused on accelerating wind deployment by promoting a better policy environment. We have categorised the region into three tiers according to the level of engagement on the topic; tier 1: Vietnam, tier 2: Philippines and Thailand, tier 3: Indonesia. We have been particularly active in Vietnam over the past two years. It is a young market where large-scale offshore wind projects are not likely to be connected to the grid until 2026 or later, and a clear regulatory framework is yet to be drawn up.

The scope of work for the taskforce involves drafting technical research papers and engaging with government representatives. One challenge of leading the working group is navigating a range of requests from various stakeholders to identify the policies that will drive growth in the wind sector. Another challenge is communicating these policy requests to various government agencies. This takes time. There are many exchanges which involve presenting reports and analysis. We need to remember that the energy transition has not been fully embraced in Southeast Asia — coal still dominates the system. It can be really tricky to get our arguments across. Changing a government’s perception of renewable energy is not an easy process.

The pandemic has also drastically reshaped the way government meetings are done. Now most meetings are done online. This is a blessing in disguise. The virtual space has reduced the complexity of setting up a meeting with government stakeholders. Last year we held more meetings with government officials than ever before.

2pm: Check the to-do list. Finally have some time to edit a policy brief. This briefing is for a workshop with the Central Economic Committee (CEC) of Vietnam on offshore wind development. This is part of a bigger process to ensure the Vietnamese government understands the importance of offshore wind in shaping the country’s energy transition.

2:45pm: Stretch and relax. Move my laptop to a standing table for a change of scene.

3:00pm: Join a webinar as a speaker. I was invited by European Climate Foundation Asia programme Tara to talk to its partners in the Philippines about offshore wind. Philippine civil society is very active, and it was heartening to see the group embrace wind as a solution for a just energy transition.

4pm: Meeting with a GWEC member company. I regularly schedule calls with members to understand their needs and keep an eye on industry developments.

5pm: Weekly meeting with global GWEC colleagues. As head of Asia, I need to catch up with the other regional heads to align our work and make sure the organisation is moving forward together.

5:30pm: Finishing up for the day. I look through the rest of the afternoon’s emails to work out what needs doing tomorrow.

6:30pm: Family time. We go for a swim or take a stroll in the park. Or we may watch some TV in the living room — the BBC documentary Our Planet is a current favourite.

7:30pm: Dinner time and facetime with my parents. As an expat living in Singapore, we do our calls with the kids’ grandparents around dinner time. It’s essential for the whole family to stay connected.

8:30pm: Put the kids to bed. I also use this time to relax and read. I am currently reading a novel called The Rice Sprout Song by Eileen Chang, which describes village life in China in the early 1950s. It is very hard to find books that truthfully describe that part of history in rural China. Her story is quite remarkable.

11:00pm: Lights out, recharge for another day.","Liming Qiao’s job is evangelising about the benefits of wind energy.

LentiGlobin gene therapy resulted in sustained production of the modified anti-sickling hemoglobin, HbAT87Q.

2. LentiGlobin led to reduced hemolysis and resolved severe vaso-occlusion from sickle cell disease.

Evidence Rating Level: 2(Good)

Study Rundown: Sickle cell disease is caused by an abnormal β-globin, resulting in sickle hemoglobin and dysfunctional red blood cells prone to hemolysis and vaso-occlusion. This leads to chronic anemia, painful vaso-occlusions, and increased mortality. Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) transplant is the only curative option, which is limited by limited compatibility and risk of complications. The LentiGlobin gene therapy utilizes a lentiviral vector to transduce autologous HSPCs with a functional β-globin gene, resulting in the production of the modified antisickling HbAT87Q and providing a potential alternative to curing the disease. The article provided an interim analysis of a study investigating the safety and efficacy of LentiGlobin in treating sickle cell patients. It was found that engraftment of the transduced HSPCs occurred in all patients, and HbAT87Q was found to contribute significantly to the total hemoglobin and red cell population. In evaluated patients, all had reduced hemolysis and complete resolution of severe vaso-occlusive event, while none developed severe adverse events or hematologic malignancies attributable to the treatment. These results that LentiGlobin was safe and efficacious in treating hemolysis and vaso-occlusion in sickle cell disease patients.

Relevant Reading: Gene Therapy in a Patient with Sickle Cell Disease

In-Depth [prospective cohort study]: This study is an interim analysis of an ongoing Phase 1-2 nonrandomized, open-label, single-dose trial looking at the LentiGlobin gene therapy for treating sickle cell disease. By the time of reporting, 43 patients had been enrolled, 35 of whom received a LentiGlobin infusion. Eligibility criteria included age between 12 and 50, a diagnosis of sickle cell disease, appropriate performance status, failure of hydroxyurea therapy, and a minimum of 4 severe vaso-occlusive events in the 24 months preceding the treatment. Patients eligible for matched allogeneic HSPC transplantation were ineligible for this trial. Patients underwent HSPC collection from peripheral blood by plerixafor mobilization and apheresis. The collected HSPCs were transduced with LentiGlobin and infused to patients following myeloablation. The primary efficacy endpoint was complete resolution of severe vaso-occlusive events, measured between 6 and 18 months after the treatment. A severe vaso-occlusive event was defined as an acute pain episode due to vaso-occlusion that led to hospitalization, repeated emergency department visits, or extended priapism requiring medical intervention. The secondary endpoint included changes to hemoglobin level, markers of hemolysis, and expression levels of βA-T87Q and HbAT87Q. The median follow-up at the time of reporting was 17.3 months (range, 3.7 to 37.6). It was found that the transduced HSPCs were engrafted in all 35 patients. Median total hemoglobin production rose from 8.5g/dL to 11g/dL or higher, sustained from 6 months to 36 months following treatment. The modified HbAT78Q containing the transduced β-globin (βA-T87Q) was found to contribute to at least 40% of total hemoglobin and was distributed in 85±8% of red blood cells by 24 months in 10 patients with available data. Hemolysis markers were observed to be similar to normal levels in all patients. No severe vaso-occlusive events were observed in the 25 patients evaluated following at least 6 months after the infusion. 3 patients reported nonserious adverse events attributable to LentiGlobin, which resolved within 1 week. 2 patients with two α-globin gene deletions in the study subsequently developed anemia, the causes of which are being investigated. No hematologic malignancies, a documented risk of lentiviral gene insertion, were observed during this study. Overall, despite a small number of patients, limited follow-up, and the lack of a control group, this interim analysis showed one-time treatment of LentiGlobin resulted in sustained benefits for sickle cell disease and resolution of severe vaso-occlusive complications.

Dr Christina Simonet and colleagues aimed to investigate common risk factors for Parkinson’s disease and how early these can occur before a Parkinson’s disease diagnosis is made. The research wanted to focus on an ethnically diverse group of people from less affluent backgrounds.

The study used the electronic health records from GP practices in East London of over a million people between 1990 and 2018. They compared people with Parkinson’s disease stated in their medical record to those without. People with neurological diseases that get worse with time, such as dementia and multiple sclerosis (MS), were not included in the study.

The researchers found that people with Parkinson’s disease tended to be older and more often male, compared to the group without. Loss of hearing and epilepsy were found to be risk factors for Parkinson’s disease, which haven’t been well reported before.

According to the NHS website, Parkinson’s disease is thought to affect around one in every 500 people. The researchers found that people with epilepsy are 2.5 times more likely to be diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease than the general population. This means for every 500 people with epilepsy, two or three people will go on to have a diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease.

Consultant neurologist at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle, Dr Rhys Thomas, said: “This is not the first time that epilepsy has been suggested to be a risk factor for Parkinson’s disease, but the size of the study makes this finding potentially important.

“There could be a few different reasons for this increased risk of being diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease in people with epilepsy. If you are already seeing a neurologist for something else, and you do have early signs of Parkinson’s disease, you are more likely to have it diagnosed correctly. Also, some epilepsy medicines can cause a tremor, which could be misdiagnosed as Parkinson’s disease (what is called parkinsonism) or it could prompt a doctor to investigate for Parkinson’s disease.

“Epilepsy is a term for a number of diseases, and some of them may be more likely to increase the risk of Parkinson’s disease than others, specifically vascular disease.”

Other risk factors included tremors, seen up to 10 years before the diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease, and memory problems, present up to five years before. Links were also found with high blood pressure, low blood pressure, constipation, depression and type 2 diabetes.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 11, 2022—Following a strong rebound in 2021, the global economy is entering a pronounced slowdown amid fresh threats from COVID-19 variants and a rise in inflation, debt, and income inequality that could endanger the recovery in emerging and developing economies, according to the World Bank’s latest Global Economic Prospects report. Global growth is expected to decelerate markedly from 5.5 percent in 2021 to 4.1 percent in 2022 and 3.2 percent in 2023 as pent-up demand dissipates and as fiscal and monetary support is unwound across the world.

The rapid spread of the Omicron variant indicates that the pandemic will likely continue to disrupt economic activity in the near term. In addition, a notable deceleration in major economies—including the United States and China—will weigh on external demand in emerging and developing economies. At a time when governments in many developing economies lack the policy space to support activity if needed, new COVID-19 outbreaks, persistent supply-chain bottlenecks and inflationary pressures, and elevated financial vulnerabilities in large swaths of the world could increase the risk of a hard landing.

“The world economy is simultaneously facing COVID-19, inflation, and policy uncertainty, with government spending and monetary policies in uncharted territory. Rising inequality and security challenges are particularly harmful for developing countries,” said World Bank Group President David Malpass. “Putting more countries on a favorable growth path requires concerted international action and a comprehensive set of national policy responses.”

The slowdown will coincide with a widening divergence in growth rates between advanced economies and emerging and developing economies. Growth in advanced economies is expected to decline from 5 percent in 2021 to 3.8 percent in 2022 and 2.3 percent in 2023—a pace that, while moderating, will be sufficient to restore output and investment to their pre-pandemic trend in these economies. In emerging and developing economies, however, growth is expected to drop from 6.3 percent in 2021 to 4.6 percent in 2022 and 4.4 percent in 2023. By 2023, all advanced economies will have achieved a full output recovery; yet output in emerging and developing economies will remain 4 percent below its pre-pandemic trend. For many vulnerable economies, the setback is even larger: output of fragile and conflict-affected economies will be 7.5 percent below its pre-pandemic trend, and output of small island states will be 8.5 percent below.

Meanwhile, rising inflation—which hits low-income workers particularly hard—is constraining monetary policy. Globally and in advanced economies, inflation is running at the highest rates since 2008. In emerging market and developing economies, it has reached its highest rate since 2011. Many emerging and developing economies are withdrawing policy support to contain inflationary pressures—well before the recovery is complete.

The latest Global Economic Prospects report features analytical sections that provide fresh insights into three emerging obstacles to a durable recovery in developing economies. The first, on debt, compares the latest international initiative to tackle unsustainable debt in developing economies—the G20 Common Framework—with previous coordinated initiatives to facilitate debt relief. Noting that COVID-19 pushed total global debt to the highest level in half a century even as the creditors’ landscape became increasingly complex, it finds that future coordinated debt relief initiatives will face higher hurdles to success. Applying lessons from the past restructurings to the G20 Common Framework can increase its effectiveness and avoid the shortcomings faced by earlier initiatives.

“The choices policymakers make in the next few years will decide the course of the next decade,” said Mari Pangestu, the World Bank’s Managing Director for Development Policy and Partnerships. “The immediate priority should be to ensure that vaccines are deployed more widely and equitably so the pandemic can be brought under control. But tackling reversals in development progress such as rising inequality will require sustained support. In a time of high debt, global cooperation will be essential to help expand the financial resources of developing economies so they can achieve green, resilient, and inclusive development.”

The second analytical section examines the implications of boom-and-bust cycles of commodity prices for emerging market and developing economies, most of which are heavily dependent on commodity exports. It finds that these cycles were particularly intense in the past two years, when commodity prices collapsed with the arrival of COVID-19 and then surged, in some cases to all time-highs last year. Global macroeconomic developments and commodity supply factors will likely cause boom-bust cycles to continue in commodity markets. For many commodities, these cycles may be amplified by the forces of climate change and the energy transition away from fossil fuels. The analysis also shows that commodity-price booms since the 1970s have tended to be larger than busts, creating significant opportunities for stronger and more sustainable growth in commodity-exporting countries—if they employ disciplined policies during booms to take advantage of windfalls.

The third analytical section explores COVID-19’s impact on global inequality. It finds that the pandemic has raised global income inequality, partly reversing the decline that was achieved over the previous two decades. It has also increased inequality in many other spheres of human activity—in the availability of vaccines; in economic growth; in access to education and health care; and in the scale of job and income losses, which have been higher for women and low-skilled and informal workers. This trend has the potential to leave lasting scars: for example, losses to human capital caused by disruptions in education can spill over across generations.

Ayhan Kose, Director of the World Bank’s Prospects Group, said: “In light of the projected slowdown in output and investment growth, limited policy space, and substantial risks clouding the outlook, emerging and developing economies will need to carefully calibrate fiscal and monetary policies. They also need to undertake reforms to erase the scars of the pandemic. These reforms should be designed to improve investment and human capital, reverse income and gender inequality, and cope with challenges of climate change.”

The fungus, Candida auris (C. auris), is considered an urgent antimicrobial resistance (AR) threat. It spread at an alarming rate in U.S. healthcare facilities and nursing homes in 2020-21, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Cases have been recorded in 28 states, including Ohio, as well as Washington, D.C., over the past 12 months. The highest numbers were reported in California, Florida, Illinois, Nevada, New York, and Texas, which each saw more than 100 cases recorded through December 2022.

Just as concerning is the number of cases in 2021 that were resistant to echinocandins, the antifungal medicine most recommended for treatment of C. auris infections, tripled, the data showed.

“The rapid rise and geographic spread of cases is concerning and emphasizes the need for continued surveillance, expanded lab capacity, quicker diagnostic tests, and adherence to proven infection prevention and control,” CDC epidemiologist Dr. Meghan Lyman, lead author of the paper, said in a CDC statement.

In general, C. auris is not a threat to healthy people. But people who are very sick, have invasive medical devices, or have long or frequent stays in healthcare facilities are at increased risk for acquiring C. auris, the CDC said.

Outbreaks can be spread by contact with affected patients and contaminated surfaces or equipment, the CDC said. C. auris can live on surfaces for several weeks.

C. auris can cause bloodstream infections and even death, particularly with hospital and nursing home patients with serious medical problems. More than one in three patients with an invasive C. auris infection – such as an infection that affects the blood, heart, or brain – die.

The most common symptoms of invasive C. auris infection are fever and chills that do not improve after antibiotic treatment for a suspected bacterial infection. Only a laboratory test can diagnose C. auris infection.

Researchers still have many unanswered questions, the CDC said. Among them are:

Why is C. auris resistant to antifungal medicines?

Why did C. auris start causing infections in recent years?

Where did C. auris originally come from, and why has it appeared in many regions of the world at the same time?

C. auris was first reported in 2016, the CDC said. Through 2021, 3,270 clinical cases (in which infection is present) and 7,413 screening cases (in which the fungus is detected but not causing infection) were reported. Clinical cases have increased each year.

Nationwide, clinical cases rose from 476 in 2019 to 1,471 in 2021. Screening cases tripled from 2020 to 2021, for a total of 4,041. Screening helps prevent spread by identifying patients carrying the fungus so that infection prevention controls can be used.

One of the complications is that C. auris can be misidentified as other types of fungi unless specialized laboratory technology is used. That can lead to patients getting the wrong treatment.","The fungus, Candida auris (C. auris), is considered an urgent antimicrobial resistance (AR) threat.

Those most susceptible to suffering life-threatening impacts are smokers, seniors and anyone who is immuno-depressed, according to officials.

The respiratory disease, and its milder variant Pontiac fever, typically develops over a two-day to 10-day period and initially begins with headaches, muscle aches and fever of 104 degrees or higher. Additional symptoms that surface can include shortness of breath, coughing with mucus production, chest pain, gastrointestinal dysfunction, including nausea and diarrhea, and even inability to think clearly, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Mayo Clinic and other sources.

And it’s a phrase Tori Yorgey, a reporter for NBC affiliate WSAZ of Huntington, West Virginia, took to heart when she was suddenly struck by a car during a live shot, fell and bounced right back up to finish her report.

The incident occurred Wednesday evening as Yorgey was reporting at the scene of a water main break in Dunbar.

In the clip, she is facing the camera when a car comes up from behind and strikes her in the back.

Yorgey lurches forward, shocked, saying: “Oh my God. I just got by a car, but I’m OK!” Her camera topples to the ground.

“You know that’s live TV for ya!"" she says with a laugh. ""It’s all good! I actually got hit by a car in college, too, just like that. I am so glad I’m OK!”

Yorgey fixes the camera and the lights and gracefully rebounds to finish her report.

In the clip, the driver who hit her is heard apologizing, and Yorgey replies, “Ma’am, you're so sweet, and you are OK.”

Yorgey told her co-host in the studio, Tim Irr: ""That woman was so nice, though. She didn't mean to. It was an accident, and I know it was.""

Seamlessly she transitioned back to her report, saying: ""Again, Tim, we'll get back to the report. We're on Roxalana Hills Drive in Dunbar. This is where that water break is.""

Yorgey, 25, who is originally from Pennsylvania, said Thursday that she's feeling fine except for a little soreness in her back and her right leg.

""I got checked out, no broken bones. They said I’ll be sore for a little,” she said.

She said the incident unfolded so quickly that she ""blacked out"" on falling and getting back up.

""I was standing there looking at the camera and as I'm literally about to speak, I just feel, like, a big old hit in my back, and I just saw the car,"" she said.

“I thought I was going under the wheel,"" she said. ""I thought I was getting run over in that moment. It was really, really scary.""

Yorgey said she doesn't remember falling and getting back up.

""That's always my first instinct, just get back up if I can,"" she said.

Yorgey said she immediately reassured the driver that she was all right, noting that the driver, as well as water workers in the area where she was shooting, checked in on her.

“I saw her face, the woman that was driving the car. She was mortified,"" she said. ""Accidents happen all the time. I felt really compelled to let her know I am good.""

Yorgey said that in her job she is often a “one-woman band” who reports on her own in the field, as she was doing Wednesday evening.

Even after the fall, Yorgey didn't miss a beat and returned to reporting.

“I felt safe, and that’s why I didn’t leave and I kept doing the live shot,"" she said.

The agency shortened the isolation from 10 days to five, followed by five days of wearing a mask for those no longer symptomatic.

The change came during the height of the omicron variant’s surge and related staffing shortages at hospitals, schools and businesses. Some critics suspected that the move was more practically motivated than science-based to allow workers, especially health care and other essential personnel, to return to their jobs quicker.

As a result, I thought it useful to review the data behind the latest recommendations to help people think through best practices.

I’m an infectious diseases specialist at the University of Virginia. I take care of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and conduct research on how the immune system responds to infection.

The CDC’s current strategy

First, let’s make a distinction between the terms “isolation” and “quarantine.” During the pandemic, people have often used them interchangeably. But isolation is meant to separate infected people from those who aren’t, whereas quarantine separates those who were exposed to COVID-19 but have not yet tested positive or are not symptomatic.

That said: If you are infected with COVID-19, the CDC’s latest guidelines have cut your isolation period by half, to five days from the onset of symptoms, or the first positive test if you do not have symptoms. After five days, as long as you are getting better, the CDC says you no longer need to isolate but should mask around others for five more days.

If you are exposed to COVID-19 and have not had your booster shot, the CDC recommends that you quarantine for five days following exposure. Between days five to seven, you should be tested, and if the test is negative, you can end the quarantine. Consider yourself exposed if you are within 6 feet of an infected person for 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period. And the CDC says if you are vaccinated and boosted, you don’t need to quarantine at all after an exposure to COVID-19 – though you should get tested five days later and mask for at least 10 days after exposure.

Regardless of vaccination status, the CDC recommends that you take a rapid antigen test or a PCR test five to seven days after exposure to confirm that you did not acquire COVID-19 prior to leaving quarantine.

New studies support these CDC recommendations

What is the evidence behind these recommendations? Although researchers are still learning about omicron – as the CDC says, “the science is evolving” – some reports suggest its symptoms appear more rapidly after exposure when compared with the delta variant. That includes the results of four small studies from Nebraska, Norway, Japan and the National Basketball Association in the U.S.

In Nebraska, a family of six was exposed at the same time to the omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Symptoms of infection appeared within one to three days of exposure, which is one to two days faster than the delta variant. This finding supports the CDC recommendations. In Norway, approximately 100 guests were exposed to omicron at a Christmas party; most got COVID-19, with symptoms appearing and infections detected within two to five days after exposure, again earlier than would have been expected for delta.

In Japan, a study of 21 people infected with omicron found that the amount of virus was highest three to six days after diagnosis or symptom onset. And a study from the NBA COVID-19 surveillance system discovered that a person with omicron was typically no longer infectious by day five.

[You’re smart and curious about the world. So are The Conversation’s authors and editors. You can read us daily by subscribing to our newsletter.]

Taken together, these studies suggest that most people who were infected with the omicron variant or who had an exposure no longer transmitted the virus by day five.

These four studies illustrate the reasoning behind the CDC’s shortening of its isolation and quarantine recommendations to five days. By that point post-infection, the vast majority of people aren’t going to spread the virus to others, so it makes sense that they can get back to their normal routines.

The follow-up test is critical if you were exposed and in quarantine

But remember the caveat: Without a rapid antigen or PCR test five to seven days after the beginning of quarantine, transmission rates of COVID-19 might only be reduced by half.

That’s why both the CDC and the World Health Organization are recommending the follow-up tests within five to seven days of the start of quarantine.

Mathematical models demonstrate that either rapid antigen or PCR testing allows for shortening of quarantine time without compromising public safety.

And one footnote: As of early March 2022, nearly 57% of Americans who are fully vaccinated have not received the booster. That means tens of millions of Americans have yet to take this extra step to more fully protect themselves from this virus.","In December 2021, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its guidelines for how long people should isolate following a COVID-19 infection.

The sudden collapse of start-up focused SVB earlier this month after a bank run has triggered the worst banking shock since the 2008 global financial crisis and drawn some of Europe's biggest lenders into investors' focus.

Signs that SVB's failure is being resolved by authorities in a smooth manner could help underpin confidence, especially among fragile US regional banks, whose stocks rose sharply on Wall Street on Monday.

Broader indicators of financial market stress were also calmer, with government bond yields rising and the euro higher against the dollar.

First Citizens BancShares has bought all the loans and deposits of SVB, giving the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC) equity rights in its stock worth as much as US$500 million in return.

First Citizens, which also has an agreement to share some potential losses with the regulator, saw its shares soar 44 per cent.

The FDIC estimates SVB's failure will cost a federal deposit insurance fund used to rescue banks about US$20 billion. The fund does not take US taxpayer money and is instead replenished by a levy on the entire banking sector.

""The bottom line is that the 2nd and 3rd largest bank failures are now resolved,"" wrote analysts at Wells Fargo led by Mike Mayo.

""The other one - Signature - cost the FDIC US$2.5 billion and similarly had no direct cost to taxpayers outside of the FDIC. This seems like a toll, especially on the largest banks, but can also show that the industry can absorb these problems and move on without outside assistance,"" they wrote.

The collapse of SVB and New York-based peer Signature Bank has left politicians wary of public perceptions that banks are being bailed out again, after anger over the sector's costly rescue in 2008.

The pair's closures also sent US depositors fleeing smaller regional banks for larger cousins.

Bloomberg News reported US authorities were in early stage deliberation about expanding emergency lending facilities which could give First Republic Bank more time to shore up its balance sheet.

Shares in First Republic, the future of which has been at the centre of investors' concerns, jumped by more than 14 per cent on Monday, with peers Western Alliance Bancorp and PacWest Bancorp climbing 7 per cent and 3 per cent, respectively.

Evidence points to wildfires increasing in frequency and intensity across vulnerable ecosystems as climate change impacts grow more evident. But periodic wildfires in ecosystems adapted to them can help inhibit plant disease outbreaks, according to research by scientists affiliated with the U.S. National Science Foundation Cedar Creek Ecosystem Long-Term Ecological Research site in Minnesota.

Interactions between disturbances like fire and disease are likely to impact whether an ecosystem changes state, such as from a woodland to a grassland. But such interactions have rarely been studied over long periods.

Researchers surveyed vegetation plots at Cedar Creek for 35 years as part of a fire frequency experiment that has been maintained for more than a half-century. The temperate oak savanna–forest ecotone that comprises the plots recently experienced an outbreak of a fungal pathogen called oak wilt.

In the absence of disease, tree population sizes were strongly influenced by fire frequency, with unburned plots transitioning from savanna to forest, while intermediately and frequently burned plots remained savanna. However, oak wilt rapidly reversed the effect of fire exclusion, increasing mortality by 765% in unburned forests while having relatively minor effects in frequently burned savannas.

The savannas include two main tree species: Quercus ellipsoidalis (red oak group; northern pin oak) and Q. macrocarpa (white oak group; bur oak). At Cedar Creek, oak wilt, or Bretziella fagacearum, has spread rapidly in the last decade, leading to exponential increases in tree mortality, particularly of red oaks.

Trends in tree populations changed strikingly from 2010 to 2018, with rapid declines in tree biomass in several plots, coinciding with the outbreak of oak wilt.

Disease invasion decreased tree biomass, increased light penetration and grass cover, and shifted tree populations from being dominated by fire‐resistant adults to fire‐sensitive saplings, especially in the unburned plots. The results are published in Ecology Letters.","Evidence points to wildfires increasing in frequency and intensity across vulnerable ecosystems as climate change impacts grow more evident.

27,27,https://www.vaticannews.va/en/vatican-city/news/2022-02/benedict-xvi-ratzinger-abuse-claims-response-forgiveness.html,"Abuse, Ratzinger: ‘Shame, sorrow, heartfelt request for forgiveness’","In a letter to the faithful of Munich, the Pope Emeritus speaks of clerical pedophilia, taking his cue from the words ""mea maxima culpa"" repeated at Mass: “We ourselves are drawn into this grievous fault whenever we neglect it or fail to confront it with the necessary decisiveness and responsibility.""

By Vatican News

Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI intervenes directly and personally to respond to the report on abuse in the diocese of Munich and Freising where he was archbishop for less than five years. He does so with a text filled with a penitential aspect, which contains his personal ""confession"" and a look of faith on the ""most grievous fault"" of abuses and cover-ups.

In the first part of the letter , Ratzinger thanks those who collaborated with him to examine the documentary material and prepare the answers sent to the commission. As he has already done in recent days, he apologizes again for the error, absolutely unintentional, about his presence at the meeting of 15 January 1980, during which it was decided to accept into the diocese a priest who required treatment. He also says he is ""particularly grateful for the confidence, support and prayer that Pope Francis personally expressed to me.""

In the second part of the letter, the Pope Emeritus says he is struck by the fact that the Church daily places at the center of every celebration of the Mass ""the confession of our sins and a petition for forgiveness. We publicly implore the living God to forgive our fault, our most grievous fault.” It is clear, Benedict continues, that ""the words ‘most grievous’ do not apply each day and to every person in the same way. Yet every day they do cause me to question if today too I should speak of a most grievous fault. And they tell me with consolation that however great my fault may be today, the Lord forgives me, if I sincerely allow myself to be examined by him, and am really prepared to change.""

Joseph Ratzinger then recalls face-to-face conversations with victims of abuse committed by clerics. ""In all my meetings, especially during my many Apostolic Journeys, with victims of sexual abuse by priests, I have seen at first hand the effects of a most grievous fault. And I have come to understand that we ourselves are drawn into this grievous fault whenever we neglect it or fail to confront it with the necessary decisiveness and responsibility, as too often happened and continues to happen.""

""As in those meetings,"" says the Pope Emeritus, ""once again I can only express to all the victims of sexual abuse my profound shame, my deep sorrow and my heartfelt request for forgiveness. I have had great responsibilities in the Catholic Church. All the greater is my pain for the abuses and the errors that occurred in those different places during the time of my mandate. Each individual case of sexual abuse is appalling and irreparable. The victims of sexual abuse have my deepest sympathy and I feel great sorrow for each individual case.""

Benedict XVI then says he understands more and more ""the repugnance and fear that Christ felt on the Mount of Olives when He saw all the dreadful things that He would have to endure inwardly. Sadly, the fact that in those moments the disciples were asleep represents a situation that, today too, continues to take place, and for which I too feel called to answer. And so, I can only pray to the Lord and ask all the angels and saints, and you, dear brothers and sisters, to pray for me to the Lord our God.""

Ratzinger concludes his letter with these words: ""Quite soon, I shall find myself before the final judge of my life. Even though, as I look back on my long life, I can have great reason for fear and trembling, I am nonetheless of good cheer, for I trust firmly that the Lord is not only the just judge, but also the friend and brother who himself has already suffered for my shortcomings, and is thus also my advocate, my ‘Paraclete’. In light of the hour of judgement, the grace of being a Christian becomes all the more clear to me. It grants me knowledge, and indeed friendship, with the judge of my life, and thus allows me to pass confidently through the dark door of death.""



Along with Benedict XVI's letter, a short three-page annex was also published, written by the four legal experts - Stefan Mückl, Helmuth Pree, Stefan Korta, and Carsten Brennecke—who had already been involved in drafting the 82-page response to the commission's questions. Those responses, attached to the report on abuse in Munich, had stirred up controversy, and contained a transcription error that led to the assertion of Archbishop Ratzinger's absence at the meeting in which it was decided to accept a priest who had been guilty of abuse.

In their new answers, the legal experts reiterate that Cardinal Ratzinger, when he accepted the transfer of the priest who was to be treated in Munich, was not aware that he was an abuser. And in the meeting of January 1980, the reason why he had to receive treatment was not mentioned, nor was it decided to engage him in pastoral activity. The documents confirm what Ratzinger said.

The reason for the error regarding Ratzinger's initially-denied presence is then explained in detail: Only Professor Mückl was allowed to view the acts in electronic version, without being allowed to save, print, or photocopy documents. In the subsequent phase of processing, Dr. Korta inadvertently made a transcription error asserting that Ratzinger was absent on January 15, 1980. One cannot therefore impute this transcription error to Benedict XVI as a conscious false statement or ""lie"". Among other things, already in 2010, several press articles, never denied, spoke of Ratzinger's presence at that meeting, and the Pope Emeritus himself, in the biography written by Peter Seewald and published in 2020, claims to have been present.

Experts say that in none of the cases analyzed by the report was Joseph Ratzinger aware of sexual abuse committed, or suspicion of sexual abuse committed, by priests. The documentation does not provide any evidence to the contrary and in fact, answering precise questions on this point during the press conference of presentation, the same lawyers who drafted the report said that they presumed with probability that Ratzinger knew, but without this claim being corroborated by testimonies or documents.

Finally, the experts deny that the responses they drafted on behalf of the Pope Emeritus downplayed the seriousness of a priest's exhibitionist behavior. ""In his memoir Benedict XVI did not minimize the exhibitionist behavior, but expressly condemned it. The phrase used as alleged evidence of minimizing exhibitionism is taken out of context."" In his response, Benedict XVI had stated that abuses, including exhibitionism, are ""terrible,"" ""sinful,"" ""morally reprehensible"", and ""irreparable."" In the canonical evaluation of the event, “there was only a desire to recall that according to the canon law then in force, exhibitionism was not a crime in the restricted sense, because the relevant penal norm did not include in the case in point behavior of that type.”

The annex signed by the four expert advisors in law, for whose work the Pope Emeritus has taken responsibility, therefore contributes to clarifying what came out of Ratzinger's mind and heart, as well as the result of the research of his advisors. Benedict XVI reiterates that he had no knowledge of the abuses committed by priests during his brief episcopate. But with humble and deeply Christian words he asks forgiveness for the ""most grievous fault"" of the abuses and for the errors and underestimations that occurred during his tenure.

Listen to our report

Following the publication of the Pope Emeritus' letter, Cardinal Séan Patrick O'Malley, President of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, released a statement.

“Conscience speaks to us if we are prepared to listen,"" he writes. ""In today’s message, Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI has provided us with an intimate description of the drama of his own conscience fashioned by a life of service to God and to his people. The evil suffered by victims of child sexual abuse by priests and religious and his handling of such abuse justly and necessarily weighs heavily on the conscience of the Pope-emeritus.

""His sober testimony reflects his awareness that moments of darkness and sinfulness have cruelly scarred survivors of child sexual abuse. Pope Benedict’s acknowledgement of the irreparable harm caused by sexual abuse in the Church and of his own failings to do everything to prevent such harm is a challenge to all those who hold positions of leadership in the Church. We must do better.

""To the survivors and all others affected by the evil of sexual abuse, Pope Emeritus Benedict offers his own contrition for what has been lacking in his stewardship. His witness and profound honesty should galvanize all of us to defend survivors of abuse and to protect all those entrusted to our care.""","Yet every day they do cause me to question if today too I should speak of a most grievous fault.
""As in those meetings,"" says the Pope Emeritus, ""once again I can only express to all the victims of sexual abuse my profound shame, my deep sorrow and my heartfelt request for forgiveness.
The victims of sexual abuse have my deepest sympathy and I feel great sorrow for each individual case.""

Consumers and businesses are signing up en masse to digital banking services, local BNPL players are raising massive rounds of funding, and PayNow, Singapore’s instant electronic payment service, is seeing huge volumes of transactions, demonstrating strong uptake of digital payments, a new report by Fintech News Singapore and Alibaba Cloud shows.

The report, titled Singapore Fintech Report 2022, looks at the state of fintech in the city-state, highlighting the key trends and critical developments that occurred over the past year and drawing out what’s to come in 2022.

Singapore Fintech Report 2022: Virtual banking takes off

Our report indicates Singaporean consumers and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are rapidly embracing virtual banking as banking habits evolve and technology development advances.

Between June and August 2020, customer sign-ups for DBS Bank’s Digibank mobile app rose by 216% year-over-year (YoY). Digibank counts 3.5 million customers.

Local rival Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation (OCBC) has seen similar growth, reporting that the number of new SME accounts opened online grew 2.4 times in Q1 2020 compared to the previous year.

Likewise, United Overseas Bank (UOB) saw a 406% YoY increase in the online purchase of its investment products in Q1 2020.

Growth in virtual banking usage comes on the back of changing customer expectations and rising demand for digital financial services.

Research conducted by global analytics software firm FICO found that 68% of Singaporean consumers prefer using digital channels to engage with their bank during financial hardship. 28% of consumers indicated preferring to communicate via Internet bank.

Singapore is also preparing for the launch of its first virtual-only banks. The Grab-Singtel consortium, SeaMoney, Ant Group and the Greenland Financial Holdings-led consortium are all working towards becoming operational in 2022.

Singapore Fintech Report 2022: Usage of digital payments accelerates

The growth of online shopping, the move towards cashless payments at brick-and-mortar stores and development in real-time payment are driving a surge in digital payment solutions, especially e-wallets, the report says.

In 2020, e-wallets were the second most popular payment method for e-commerce purchases in Singapore, behind credit cards, according to the 2021 Global Payments Report by FIS. By 2024, e-wallets are expected to overtake credit cards and account for 27% of all online purchase transactions.

PayNow, Singapore’s peer-to-peer (P2P) fund transfer service running on the Fast And Secure Transfers (FAST) instant interbank payment rail, saw individual registrations rise by 1.6 million in 2020, bringing the total of registrations to 4.9 million. Meanwhile, PayNow Corporate registrations doubled to about 240,000.

In tandem, initiatives to link up Singapore’s national real-time payment system with others in the region are advancing, demonstrating the city state’s leadership in the regional cross-border payment scene.

The linkage of Singapore’s PayNow and Thailand’s PromptPay real-time retail payment systems was successfully launched in April 2021 to facilitate cross-border payments between the two countries. It was followed by linkage with Malaysia’s DuitNow. By July 2022, PayNow is expected to be connected to India’s Unified Payments Interface (UPI) real-time payment system.

Separately, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is involved in Project Dunbar, an initiative spearheaded by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) to use central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) to facilitate cross-border payments.

Singapore Fintech Report 2022: BNPL market heats up

Another booming fintech segment in Singapore is BNPL. BNPL arrangements are a type of short-term financing that allows consumers to make purchases and pay for them in installments.

In Singapore, these products have surged in popularity since the beginning of the pandemic as consumers look to stretch their dollars and online merchants seek to tap into the shift to online channels to boost sales.

Data from a Milleu Insight research found that 30% of Singaporeans aged 25-40 have used a BNPL service. 67% of consumers cited rewards or cashbacks as the top motivators to use BNPL services.

BNPL providers have indicated witnessing significant traction and growth. During the pandemic, Hoolah, one of the most prominent players in Singapore, recorded more than 1,500% growth in transactions and over 800% increase in sales value. Cashback startup ShopBack recently agreed to acquire Hoolah for an undisclosed amount.

In October, Standard Chartered signed a 10-year strategic partnership with Atome Financial, the operator of one of the largest BNPL platforms in Asia. The bank has also committed US$500 million to support Atome Financial expand its group of merchants and customers.

And just last week, Pace, a Singapore-based BNPL solution, closed a massive US$40 million Series A funding round. Pace, which was just launched this year, seeks to hit a gross merchandise value (GMV) run rate of US$1 billion by 2022 and grow its user base by 25 times over the next 12 months. The startup is already looking to expand to Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.

29,29,https://www.healthline.com/health/autoimmune-adrenalitis,"Autoimmune Adrenalitis: Causes, Diagnosis, Treatment, & More","Autoimmune disease happens when your immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissues. Depending on the tissue that’s affected, this can lead to a variety of symptoms. In autoimmune adrenalitis, the immune system attacks the adrenal glands. This can cause a condition called primary adrenal insufficiency, or Addison’s disease. Below, we’ll examine autoimmune adrenalitis in more detail, including its symptoms, causes, and treatment. Keep reading to learn more.

What is autoimmune adrenalitis? Autoimmune adrenalitis is an autoimmune disease where your immune system attacks your adrenal glands. You have two adrenal glands. Each one is located on the top of your kidneys. They work to produce a variety of different hormones. Autoimmune adrenalitis specifically affects the adrenal cortex, which is the outer part of the adrenal gland. The immune system attacks and destroys this area, resulting in the loss of the production of two hormones: Cortisol. One of the main hormones involved in your responses to stress, cortisol also has a role in reducing inflammation and regulating things like metabolism, blood sugar, and blood pressure.

One of the main hormones involved in your responses to stress, cortisol also has a role in reducing inflammation and regulating things like metabolism, blood sugar, and blood pressure. Aldosterone. Helping to maintain the balance of potassium and sodium in your blood, aldosterone is important for maintaining healthy blood pressure, stable heart rate, and proper function of nerves and muscles. A lack of these hormones is what causes symptoms. Potentially life threatening complications can occur if the condition isn’t treated. Autoimmune adrenalitis is the most common cause of primary adrenal insufficiency. The more common name for this condition is Addison’s disease.

What causes autoimmune adrenalitis? The exact cause of autoimmune adrenalitis isn’t known. It’s generally believed that a combination of genetic and environmental factors contribute to the development of the condition. Certain variations in genes for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex proteins are associated with autoimmune adrenalitis. HLA proteins play a vital role in the way your immune system distinguishes your own tissue from foreign invaders like bacteria and viruses. In autoimmune adrenalitis, your immune system targets a normal protein called 21-hydroxylase, which is important for hormone production in the adrenal cortex. The resulting immune response to 21-hydroxylase causes damage to the adrenal cortex.

How is autoimmune adrenalitis diagnosed? Autoimmune adrenalitis can be difficult to diagnose. This is due to the fact that symptoms can come on slowly and many early symptoms are vague or nonspecific. First, your doctor will take your medical history. They’ll ask questions about your symptoms and whether or not you or other people in your family have a history of autoimmune disease. Then, they’ll do a physical examination. During this time, they’ll check your vital signs and may check your skin for areas of hyperpigmentation. Your doctor may also take a sample of your blood from your arm to use for blood tests if necessary. After taking your medical history and doing a physical examination, your doctor can use the following tests to help diagnose autoimmune adrenalitis: Cortisol test. A cortisol test measures the levels of cortisol in your blood. The sample is taken in the morning. Low levels can indicate that your adrenal glands aren’t functioning well.

A cortisol test measures the levels of cortisol in your blood. The sample is taken in the morning. Low levels can indicate that your adrenal glands aren’t functioning well. Aldosterone test. An aldosterone test looks at levels of aldosterone in your blood. Similar to cortisol, low levels can point to adrenal dysfunction.

An aldosterone test looks at levels of aldosterone in your blood. Similar to cortisol, low levels can point to adrenal dysfunction. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) test. ACTH is the hormone that usually stimulates cortisol production in the adrenal glands. People with autoimmune adrenalitis can have elevated ACTH levels in their blood.

ACTH is the hormone that usually stimulates cortisol production in the adrenal glands. People with autoimmune adrenalitis can have elevated ACTH levels in their blood. Renin. Renin is the hormone that typically prompts production of aldosterone in the adrenal glands. Renin levels can be high in people with autoimmune adrenalitis.

Renin is the hormone that typically prompts production of aldosterone in the adrenal glands. Renin levels can be high in people with autoimmune adrenalitis. Metabolic panel.

A metabolic panel can help your doctor to evaluate your blood sugar, show low sodium levels and high potassium levels in your blood, and help diagnose hypoglycemia. Anti-21-hydroxylase antibodies screen. Many people with autoimmune adrenalitis make autoantibodies to 21-hydroxylase that can be detected through testing.

Many people with autoimmune adrenalitis make autoantibodies to 21-hydroxylase that can be detected through testing. ACTH stimulation test. In this test, your doctor will see if levels of cortisol rise in response to an intravenous (IV) or intramuscular injection of ACTH. If little or no response is seen, it can point to problems with the adrenal glands.

In this test, your doctor will see if levels of cortisol rise in response to an intravenous (IV) or intramuscular injection of ACTH. If little or no response is seen, it can point to problems with the adrenal glands. Imaging tests. Imaging technology, such as a CT scan, may be helpful in viewing your adrenal glands. It can also help determine if adrenal dysfunction may be happening due to another cause, such as an infection or cancer.

How is autoimmune adrenalitis treated? The treatment for autoimmune adrenalitis involves replacing the missing hormones. You’ll be prescribed medications that you’ll take by mouth each day for the rest of your life. Your doctor will tailor the dose to your individual needs. In order to reduce the likelihood of side effects, ideally this will be the lowest possible dose that gets rid of your symptoms. Cortisol may be replaced using a corticosteroid. This is typically hydrocortisone, although it’s possible that prednisone may also be used. A medication called fludrocortisone can help with a lack of aldosterone production. It’s also important to be aware that you’ll also need to take a higher dose of your medications when you’re experiencing added physical stress. Some examples include: during an illness

before, during, and after surgery

after experiencing an injury

during pregnancy or delivery You may also receive a corticosteroid injection kit. You can carry the kit with you in case an adrenal crisis comes on suddenly before help can arrive. An adrenal crisis is treated in the hospital with IV corticosteroids and an IV saline solution that has added sugar. Questions for your doctor or healthcare professional If you’ve recently received an autoimmune adrenalitis diagnosis, you may have a lot of questions or concerns. Below are some examples of questions to ask your doctor or healthcare professional: What’s the outlook for me individually?

Does autoimmune adrenalitis put me at risk of other health conditions?

What are the potential side effects of my medications? What can I do to help deal with them?

Are there any medications or supplements that can interfere with the medications I take for my autoimmune adrenalitis?

What’s the recommended dose of my medications when I’m under stress?

Are there any lifestyle changes that would be helpful for managing my condition?

How often should I plan to visit you for health check-ins?

What types of symptoms should I call you about? When should I go to the emergency room? Was this helpful?

Can autoimmune adrenalitis be prevented? There’s currently no way to prevent autoimmune adrenalitis. If you’ve already received this diagnosis, in addition to taking your medications as directed, it may be helpful to add more sodium to your diet. This is because people with autoimmune adrenalitis can have lower sodium levels. It’s important to remember to always consult your doctor or another healthcare professional before making adjustments to your diet. They can help recommend the best sources and amounts of sodium, calcium, and vitamin D for you.

What is the outlook for people with autoimmune adrenalitis? If it’s not treated quickly, an adrenal crisis can be fatal. This condition typically comes on due to increased stress from things like: an injury or surgery

an infection

intense psychological stress or trauma According to a 2014 review, around 50 percent of people with autoimmune adrenalitis also develop another autoimmune disease. A few examples include: Hashimoto’s thyroiditis

Graves’ disease

type 1 diabetes

hypoparathyroidism

pernicious anemia When autoimmune adrenalitis is identified and treated promptly, the outlook is generally good. However, the condition does require lifelong replacement of missing hormones, which must be carefully managed by a doctor or healthcare professional.","Below, we’ll examine autoimmune adrenalitis in more detail, including its symptoms, causes, and treatment.

30,30,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/chorea-and-huntingtons-disease-whats-the-difference,Chorea and Huntington's disease: What's the difference?,"Many people with Huntington’s disease experience chorea, but they are separate conditions. Chorea is one of several common symptoms of Huntington’s disease, but it has other potential causes. Chorea is a neurological condition that involves involuntary, random, and continuous movement while a person is awake. It can affect the entire body but commonly causes movement in the face, hands, and feet. The movements stop when the person falls asleep. Chorea is a symptom of several conditions, including Huntington’s disease, which is a rare, inherited disorder. A person has a 50% chance of developing the condition if one of their biological parents is living with the condition. In the United States, about 30,000 people are living with Huntington’s disease, and an estimated 200,000 more are at risk of developing the disease. A person typically develops symptoms aged 30–50 years. Following the onset of symptoms, a person with Huntington’s disease may live for another 15–20 years as the disease progresses.

Is Huntington’s disease the same as chorea? Huntington’s disease is not the same as chorea. Chorea is one of several common symptoms of Huntington’s disease. Other symptoms of Huntington’s disease include: impaired judgment

forgetfulness

unsteady gait

difficulty talking

trouble eating and swallowing

depression

changes in personality

mood swings

weight loss

Does Huntington’s disease cause chorea? Most cases of Huntington’s disease will result in the person developing chorea. Chorea involves involuntary movements, muscle jerks, or tics. Chorea is not limited to Huntington’s disease, and other neurological conditions can also cause it. An accurate diagnosis is important so that a person experiencing chorea can receive appropriate treatment.

What causes chorea in Huntington’s disease? Huntington’s disease is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder that an individual can inherit from a parent living with the condition. In other words, people develop symptoms slowly over time as the disease affects the brain. When the effects on the brain are severe enough, a person with Huntington’s disease will start to notice symptoms, which may include uncontrolled muscle movements due to chorea. Chorea occurs when there is overactivity in the basal ganglia, which is the part of the brain that controls movement. Additional symptoms may start to develop over time, including impaired movement and speech, changes in personality, and cognitive issues. Some evidence suggests that not everyone who develops chorea due to Huntington’s disease is aware that they have the symptom. For instance, in a 2020 study , researchers tested 50 people with Huntingdon’s disease for chorea. They noted that about 46% of the participants did not report chorea despite having clinical signs of it. Additionally, about 88% of those who reported chorea did not note it affecting all areas of the body in which researchers observed the symptom.

How do doctors treat chorea in Huntington’s disease? People living with Huntington’s disease often receive supportive treatment for chorea. For other causes, a doctor will treat the underlying condition to address chorea. There is no cure for Huntington’s disease, and it is not possible to slow or reverse the course of the disease. Instead, treatments focus on helping a person find symptom relief with medications and therapy. To help manage chorea in Huntington’s disease, doctors may prescribe tetrabenazine (Xenazine) or deutetrabenazine (Austedo). If someone is experiencing chorea due to another cause, a different medication may be necessary to address the underlying cause. A doctor may also prescribe antipsychotic medications for involuntary movements. This supportive care may help with mild symptoms, but it may become less effective as the disease progresses. In addition, a doctor may recommend physical or occupational therapy to help a person develop additional muscle strength and learn to move around safely. Therapists may work with family members or caregivers to help set up a safe home environment. For other symptoms or complications, such as depression, a doctor may recommend counseling or antidepressants.

Can you have Huntington’s disease without chorea? The majority of people living with Huntington’s disease will develop some form of tics or involuntary muscle movement. However, a 2020 study found that many people living with Huntington’s disease are unaware of chorea in all or some areas of the body. Additionally, as the disease progresses, chorea may subside. In its place, a person may develop akinesia, the inability to move a muscle by choice. What other conditions have chorea as a symptom? Chorea is not only a symptom of Huntington’s disease. Several conditions can cause chorea. Doctors may classify chorea as a primary (idiopathic, hereditary) or secondary (acquired) condition. They may sometimes find diagnosing the cause of chorea challenging because the condition presents in almost the same way regardless of cause. However, hereditary forms tend to present symmetrically and develop gradually, whereas acquired forms may be asymmetrical or unilateral and are often acute. Other conditions that may cause chorea include: Sydenham’s chorea

systemic lupus erythematosus

focal vascular lesions in the basal ganglia

metabolic or endocrinological disorders, such as hyperthyroidism

side effects of certain medications, such as levodopa, neuroleptics, and birth control pills

pregnancy

autoimmune disorders","In the United States, about 30,000 people are living with Huntington’s disease, and an estimated 200,000 more are at risk of developing the disease.

Its incidence and the increased risk of other conditions or complications are different in males and females. Although symptoms and treatment may vary, these differ for each individual, rather than across age or gender. Share on Pinterest The Good Brigade/Getty Images Crohn’s disease is a chronic condition that causes inflammation in the digestive tract. It affects approximately 780,000 Americans. Although IBD incidence varies with age and gender, symptoms differ among individuals based on where the inflammation occurs. Some people may experience milder effects, while others have severe symptoms. Read this article to learn more about the onset of Crohn’s disease, symptoms, common causes, conditions associated with it, and ways to treat and manage IBD. A note about sex and gender Sex and gender exist on spectrums. This article will use the terms “male,” “female,” or both to refer to sex assigned at birth. Click here to learn more. Was this helpful?

The onset of Crohn’s disease Research suggests that Crohn’s disease has a peak prevalence in 30–39 and affects genders differently based on population. For example, in Canada and New Zealand, females are 10–30% more likely to acquire the condition, while in Japan and Korea, males are up to three times more likely to develop Crohn’s disease. Further research suggests that females have a lower risk of Crohn’s disease than males during childhood, until the age range of 10–14 years. Females have a higher risk after age 14. Males may be more likely to develop Crohn’s at a younger age than a person who is older. In addition, males may be at more risk of developing ulcerative colitis, another form of IBD, than females. Read more from our IBD hub.

Individuals may experience flare-ups or a relapse, where symptoms of the condition are active and range in severity. Flare-ups may last from a few days to weeks or months. A person should consult their gastroenterologist or IBD nurse to discuss managing these. Between flare-ups, individuals may be in remission and not experience any symptoms. People who are experiencing severe symptoms or symptoms lasting longer than a few weeks should consult their specialist doctor for medical assistance. A prolonged flare-up can negatively impact an individual’s quality of life and can lead to additional problems in the gut. These include intestinal strictures. Doctors characterize strictures as uncontrolled inflammation where the diameter of the intestine narrows. They may treat this type of inflammation with anti-inflammatory medications. However, if the inflammation is ongoing, scar tissue starts forming, requiring procedures (surgical or endoscopic). Anti-inflammatories will not have as much effect on scar tissue. Strictures can result in blockages referred to as bowel obstruction or fistulous tracts. Read about how to recognize a flare-up here.

Complications At present, there is insufficient research investigating differences in complications of Crohn’s disease in males and females. However, other complications of Crohn’s disease symptoms and flare-ups include: ankylosing spondylitis — chronic arthritis

episcleritis — inflammation of the episcleral, the coating of the eye wall

erythema nodosum — painful red bumps on the skin

pyoderma gangrenosum (Crohn’s disease rash)

kidney stones

gallstones

anemia

a blood disorder such as hypercoagulability

osteoporosis In rare cases, perforation of the bowel may occur during a severe flare-up. Symptoms include severe abdominal pain, fever, nausea, and vomiting. In some cases, the leak will form an abscess. A person must consult a doctor or visit an emergency room as this could be life threatening.

Causes The exact cause of Crohn’s disease is not fully known. However, scientists have made major advances over the past few years, particularly in the role of genetics. Research from 2021 associated more than 100 genes with IBD, meaning genetics may play a crucial part in causing Crohn’s disease. Researchers believe that Crohn’s also correlates to a combination of environmental factors, such as: viruses

bacteria

diet

smoking

certain medications

stress Scientists are still investigating whether any factors may influence the risk of males getting this disease more than females.

Outlook Individuals with Crohn’s disease may be able to recognize symptoms they experience due to certain foods and environmental triggers, which may help minimize the risk of a flare-up. If a person cannot identify the triggers, a doctor will develop a strategy to help reduce the frequency and severity of flare-ups and associated symptoms. A person can consult a doctor to explore IBD medications’ benefits and more serious risks. Doctors advise that flares may occur when people do not take medications as prescribed. However, if people take their medications as prescribed and still experience flares, they should speak with their doctor. They may suggest changing the dose or type of medication to help manage IBD. Even if a person does not experience side effects or symptoms (in remission), taking the prescribed medication is important for managing Crohn’s and long-term effects.","Crohn’s disease is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

32,32,https://www.dental-tribune.com/news/new-research-outlines-vapings-unique-connection-to-periodontal-disease/,New research outlines vaping’s unique connection to periodontal disease,"NEW YORK, US: Smoking tobacco has long been known to be detrimental to oral health, but the risks of newer simulations of smoking such as vaping are less well-known though they are often believed to be healthier alternatives. Now, researchers from the New York University (NYU) College of Dentistry have completed the first study on the oral health of users of e-cigarettes. They found that vaping created a unique periodontal microbiome, compared with that of non-smokers and conventional cigarette smokers, and that participants who vaped experienced a worsened state of periodontal disease at the end of the study.

The study compared the bacterial composition and cytokine concentrations of the subgingival plaque in conventional cigarette smokers, e-cigarette users and non-smokers over the course of six months. The participants in all groups exhibited some evidence of periodontal disease at baseline.

In the e-cigarette users, the detected cytokine levels indicated inflammation, but some cytokines were at lower levels than expected. The researchers believe this was possibly due to the strains of bacteria present in those who vaped but not present in those who smoked or who had never smoked. The researchers hypothesised that it was possible that these bacteria were actively supressing the immune reactions that would normally have been expected.

Co-author of the study Fangxi Xu, a junior research scientist at NYU, said in a press release : “Vaping appears to be driving unique patterns in bacteria and influencing the growth of some bacteria in a manner akin to cigarette smoking, but with its own profile and risks to oral health.”

Even worse was the finding that clinical attachment loss after six months was signficantly worse in the e-cigarette smokers. This was measured in the same groups of participants but in a separate, earlier study .

Lead author of the most recent study Dr Scott Thomas, an assistant research scientist at NYU, said of the findings: “E-cigarette use is a relatively new human habit. Unlike smoking, which has been studied extensively for decades, we know little about the health consequences of e-cigarette use and are just starting to understand how the unique microbiome promoted by vaping impacts oral health and disease.”

More long-term research is needed for dentists to feel comfortable offering counsel to their patients regarding e-cigarette use. E-cigarettes and alternative tobacco products fall under the umbrella of what some call tobacco harm reduction.

Dental Tribune International reported that a survey of German dentists by the German subsidiary of Philip Morris International (PMG), a cigarette company moving towards smoke-free products, found that 58% of the respondents did not feel informed on the subject of tobacco harm reduction and that 69% were not aware of the concept.

Dr Charilaos Avrabos, then PMG’s manager of scientific and medical affairs, claimed in a 2018 press briefing regarding the survey that “it is clear that e-cigarettes are not risk-free products; neither are tobacco heating devices. For non-smokers, these are not products that offer any benefits. For smokers, who use the most damaging form of nicotine delivery continually over a period of years, switching to these products can make a huge difference by reducing the amount of harmful substance.”

However, PMG’s claims seem to be contradicted by the findings of the NYU research and the results of a 2020 study on vaping’s effect on periodontal health. Senior author of that study Dr Purnima Kumar, professor of periodontics at Ohio State University, said: “If you stop smoking and start vaping instead, you don’t move back toward a healthy bacterial profile but shift up to the vaping profile. Knowing the vaping profile is pathogen-rich, you’re not doing yourself any favours by using vaping to quit smoking.”","They found that vaping created a unique periodontal microbiome, compared with that of non-smokers and conventional cigarette smokers, and that participants who vaped experienced a worsened state of periodontal disease at the end of the study.

What to know:

A high intake of fructose may increase the risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease , in which too much fat is stored in liver cells.

High-fructose corn syrup is one of the most common sweeteners in the food industry and is used to sweeten many products despite the scientific evidence that it is associated with metabolic disorders that are risk factors of cardiovascular disease.

Researchers found that consuming a high-fructose diet for long periods can lead to a deterioration of the layer of cells that creates the intestinal barrier that prevents bacteria and toxins from leaking into the bloodstream and affecting the liver.

Fatty liver disease can lead to liver inflammation and liver damage, resulting in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, a more aggressive disease that in turn can progress to scarring of the liver (cirrhosis), liver cancer, and liver failure.

Severe fatty liver disease and liver tumors from the gut barrier deterioration created by excessive fructose intake can be prevented with medications.

Speaking in Parliament during his ministry’s Committee of Supply debate, Mr Chan noted that mid-year examinations for Primary 3 and 5 and Secondary 1 and 3 students have been removed over the last few years.

“We saw the positive impact. Schools and teachers can better pace and deepen students’ learning,” he said.

“They use ongoing assessments to identify what students have mastered and the areas they have difficulties with. Students also focus more on their learning and less on marks.”

Removing mid-year examinations for all primary and secondary levels frees up more time for “self-directed learning and developing 21st-century competencies”, said the Education Minister.

Schools can choose to remove the remaining mid-year examinations for some or all of the remaining levels in 2022 if they are “ready to do so”, said the Ministry of Education (MOE) in a separate factsheet.

More than one-third of secondary schools and about one in 14 primary schools have already removed mid-year examinations for Secondary 2 and Primary 4 students respectively, it said.

Schools will continue to conduct a range of assessments, including weighted assessments each term.

The Education Ministry is also reviewing curriculum content and assessment demand, said Mr Chan.

“Any one standard curriculum will necessarily not be able to meet the diverse learning needs of our students,” he added.

“Any average curriculum will necessarily mean that many students will be overstretched while others are under-stretched. Hence, we must have a range of options to cater to our students’ diverse abilities and learning needs.”

DSA TO JC TO BE EXPANDED

MOE will expand the Direct School Admission (DSA) programme for all government and government-aided junior colleges, Mr Chan announced.

These are: Anderson Serangoon Junior College, Anglo-Chinese Junior College, Catholic Junior College, Eunoia Junior College, Jurong Pioneer Junior College, National Junior College, Nanyang Junior College, St. Andrew’s Junior College, Tampines Meridian Junior College, Temasek Junior College, Victoria Junior College and Yishun Innova Junior College.

From the 2022 DSA-JC exercise, these junior colleges can admit up to 20 per cent of their non-Integrated Programme intake through DSA, double of the current 10 per cent.

“This recognises other forms of merit beyond academic grades,” Mr Chan said.

THIRD LANGUAGE AND OVERSEAS PROGRAMMES

A Modular Third Language Programme will be piloted in schools, so that more secondary school students can learn new languages and discover other cultures, said Mr Chan.

Under the programme, students can pick up a third language at different levels, build on their proficiency, and stack modules towards a certificate, he added.

Students can take up a “learning module” at the start of each school semester and “deepen their mastery” in that third language across their secondary school years, said the ministry in the factsheet.

The pilot programme will allow MOE to assess the feasibility of this approach and the level of interest among students, it said.

MOE will also designate Raffles Institution (RI) as the fourth centre for the Elective Programme in Malay Language for Secondary Schools (EMAS) from 2023.

The other centres are Bukit Panjang Government High School, Tanjong Katong Secondary School and Anderson Secondary School.

The EMAS programme supports students with a strong proficiency in Malay through language and cultural activities like local camps and immersion programmes.

This will allow more students to access the programme, and students from other schools may also attend the programme at RI, Mr Chan said.

The Education Ministry also wants every school to have an overseas partnership, he said.

Currently, about two-thirds of schools have established partnerships with overseas counterparts.

“This facilitates more student exchanges, so that students broaden their horizons and learn about different cultures,” said Mr Chan.

“While the exchanges have been virtual for now because of COVID, technology allows our students and their overseas peers to still learn, play and celebrate special occasions together.”

Institutes of higher learning will also continue to work towards the target of having 70 per cent of students with an overseas experience, of which 70 per cent will be in ASEAN countries, China and India, he added.","SINGAPORE: Mid-year examinations for all primary and secondary school levels will be removed by 2023, announced Minister for Education Chan Chun Sing on Monday (Mar 7).

36,36,https://www.froedtert.com/stories/advanced-lung-disease-treatment,Advanced Lung Disease Treatment Options for Better Breathing,"Shortness of breath. A persistent cough or chest congestion. Unexplained fatigue and weight loss. Any of these symptoms can be a sign of lung disease. Because there are many different lung disorders, accurate diagnosis can be challenging.

The advanced lung disease experts at the Froedtert & the Medical College of Wisconsin health network can pinpoint the problem and make breathing easier.

“People concerned about a lung or breathing problem can start with pulmonologists available across our network,” said Julie Biller, MD, pulmonologist and MCW faculty member. “Additionally, many of our pulmonologists further specialize in pulmonary medicine for conditions such as interstitial lung disease, cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung transplant.”

The Froedtert & MCW team offers a depth of experience and expertise in diagnosing and treating the major lung diseases. Many different components go into lung disease treatment and diagnosis within the Froedtert & MCW health network.

“We offer all of the cutting-edge therapies, including clinical trials and lung transplant,” said Alan Betensley, MD, pulmonologist, medical director of lung transplantation and MCW faculty member. “Patients with severe lung disease don’t have to figure out what to do next, except know that we provide optimal diagnostic and treatment approaches.”

This large group includes disorders that produce inflammation in the mesh-like tissue around the air sacs of the lungs. It can lead to scarring that restricts the flow of oxygen into the bloodstream.

“There are a variety of causes for interstitial lung disease,” said Mark Barash, DO, pulmonologist and MCW faculty member. “They include ‘idiopathic,’ meaning the cause is unknown; environmental factors like asbestos and silica dust; inhalation exposures; chemotherapy, chest radiation and a variety of medications; and autoimmune disease where the body’s immune system attacks organs like the lungs.

“Our approach is highly individualized. We begin with a detailed history and physical, get high-resolution chest images and do breathing and blood tests. Research shows that academic medical centers like ours that see more people with pulmonary issues and discuss cases with multidisciplinary teams are generally able to make a more accurate diagnosis.”

This type of lung disease treatment can include steroids to reduce inflammation, antifibrotics to slow down progressive scarring and medications to suppress the body’s immune response. Additionally, as researchers, our team is continually studying new medications that can help patients with advanced lung disease, and we participate in national and multicenter clinical trials.

“Many of these lung conditions continue to progress and can be life altering or life ending,” Dr. Barash said. “For the most common interstitial lung disease, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, lung transplant is the most effective therapy for long-term lung function improvement and survival.”

A genetic disorder, cystic fibrosis prevents an important protein from functioning correctly, resulting in the buildup of abnormally thick mucus in the sinuses, lungs, pancreas and bile ducts. It can cause frequent lung infections, damage the airways and obstruct breathing. The most severe cases may require lung transplant.

New medications are increasing life expectancy and reducing the need for transplant. “These options include drugs that improve protein function and the health of people with cystic fibrosis,” Dr. Biller said.

Additionally, Froedtert & MCW physicians are continually involved in national research studies to evaluate the newest medications aimed at helping those with cystic fibrosis, including options to reduce patients’ need for at-home inhalation lung disease treatments.

COPD is a broad category of inflammatory conditions that constrict airflow out of the lungs. Most commonly, it refers to emphysema and chronic bronchitis.

“Both are related to the cumulative effect of smoking,” Dr. Betensley said. “If people quit smoking early, they don’t develop COPD.”

While uncommon, COPD and emphysema can also be caused by environmental lung irritants or genetics.

One of the newest treatments is bronchoscopic lung volume reduction (BLVR), a minimally invasive procedure that places tiny, one-way valves into the most diseased lung lobe. The lungs of emphysema patients lose elasticity, preventing them from exhaling effectively. BLVR valves allow air out but not in, enabling the lung to deflate better, and help relieve shortness of breath.

“We see about a 15% improvement, and often patients considered for lung transplant improve enough that they no longer need a transplant,” Dr. Betensley said.

On the research front, the pulmonary team is investigating bronchoscopic procedures that shrink or freeze the glands responsible for the production of excess mucus to reduce airway congestion.

Researchers are also focusing on so-called “overlap syndrome,” where features of COPD, asthma and interstitial lung disease occur together. “We’re looking at how to treat all components,” Dr. Biller said.

A respiratory virus, COVID-19 inflames the lungs. “Mild cases may not affect the lungs that much, but moderate to serious cases can progress to viral pneumonia,” Dr. Biller said.

Patients at Froedtert & MCW hospitals receive treatments tailored to the severity of their illness, including oxygen to assist breathing, the steroid dexamethasone to reduce inflammation, various monoclonal antibodies to help the body’s immune system, antiviral agents to block the virus, and antibiotics if bacterial pneumonia arises.

“We estimate that 10% to 30% of people with acute COVID may develop long-term symptoms, and we’ve established a multidisciplinary clinic to treat their unique needs,” Dr. Biller said.","Any of these symptoms can be a sign of lung disease.

37,37,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/cia-says-havana-syndrome-not-result-sustained-global-campaign-hostile-rcna12838,CIA says 'Havana Syndrome' not result of sustained global campaign by hostile power,"In a new intelligence assessment, the CIA has ruled out that the mysterious symptoms known as Havana Syndrome are the result of a sustained global campaign by a hostile power aimed at hundreds of U.S. diplomats and spies, six people briefed on the matter told NBC News.

In about two dozen cases, the agency cannot rule out foreign involvement, including many of the cases that originated at the U.S. Embassy in Havana beginning in 2016. Another group of cases is considered unresolved. But in hundreds of other cases of possible symptoms, the agency has found plausible alternative explanations, the sources said.

The CIA declined to comment.

The idea that widespread brain injury symptoms have been caused by Russia or another foreign power targeting Americans around the world, either to harm them or to collect intelligence, has been deemed unfounded, the sources said.

People who have experienced possible Havana Syndrome symptoms and have been briefed on the assessment have expressed deep disappointment, the sources said. Some have pointed out that the CIA’s findings are considered an interim assessment and that they were not coordinated with other agencies, including the Defense Department.

“CIA just kind of struck out on their own,” a person briefed on the findings said.

In a statement, a group that represents U.S. officials who have reported suspected incidents said, “The CIA’s newly issued report may be labeled ‘interim’ and it may leave open the door for some alternative explanation in some cases, but to scores of dedicated public servants, their families, and their colleagues, it has a ring of finality and repudiation.”

“We have reason to believe the interim report does not even represent the consensus of the full CIA,” said the group Advocacy for Victims of Havana Syndrome, “instead reflecting the views of a subset of officials most interested in resolution and closure.”

Nonetheless, almost no one who has been working closely on the issue is surprised that many recent cases of what the Biden administration calls “anomalous health incidents” have plausible explanations unrelated to possible hostile acts. When government agencies began urging any employee who had suffered unexplained headaches and dizziness to report it, it was inevitable that many of the cases would not fit the parameters of what doctors had identified in the diplomats and spies who suffered brain injuries.

“Even two dozen cases is a lot of cases if Americans were attacked,” one person briefed on the findings said.

There is an intensive intelligence gathering and analytical effort to resolve those cases, officials said.

Starting in late 2016, U.S. diplomats and spies serving in Cuba began reporting bizarre sounds and sensations followed by unexplained illnesses and symptoms, including hearing and vision loss, memory and balance problems, headaches and nausea.

Over the years, many hundreds of U.S. officials have come forward reporting suspected incidents in more than a dozen countries, NBC News has reported.

NBC News reported in 2018 that U.S. intelligence officials considered Russia a leading suspect in what some of them assessed to have been deliberate attacks on diplomats and CIA officers overseas. But in the three years since then, the spy agencies have not uncovered enough evidence to pinpoint the cause or the culprit of the health incidents.

The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine said in a report in 2020 that some of the observed brain injuries were consistent with the effects of directed microwave energy, which the report said Russia has long studied.

Russia has consistently denied any involvement.

A team of medical and scientific experts who studied the symptoms of as many as 40 State Department and other government employees concluded that nothing like them had previously been documented in medical literature, the National Academies of Sciences report said. Many reported hearing a loud sound and feeling pressure in their heads and then experiencing dizziness, unsteady gait and visual disturbances. Many suffered long-standing debilitating effects.

U.S. officials have long said they cannot say for sure that they were intentional attacks or even that they were the result of human activity.

But privately, CIA Director William Burns had referred to the incidents as attacks. One of Burns’ aides suffered symptoms during a trip to New Delhi in 2020.

Nonetheless, Burns and the director of national intelligence, Avril Haines, have endorsed the findings, the sources said.

The CIA report aims to address a concern that has grown more intense as more and more cases have been reported: that a U.S. adversary had managed to harm hundreds of Americans in dozens of countries while evading detection by the U.S.

U.S. officials stressed that the interim report was not a final conclusion of the broader Biden administration or the full intelligence community. The White House National Security Council has convened a task force involving outside medical and scientific experts that is also examining Havana Syndrome and is expected to release some findings in the near future, officials said. The Defense Department, the FBI and the State Department are all still working to investigate the origins of the syndrome and how to mitigate it, the officials said.

Instead, the interim CIA report is focused narrowly on the number of incidents that are believed to be potentially attributable to a foreign actor, officials said.

Still, the report marks a significant change of tone from the Biden administration, which has made a point of demonstrating that it is taking the incidents more seriously than the Trump administration did and has repeatedly emphasized the need to take victims seriously. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, in comments on MSNBC last week, recalled having met with State Department employees who have come forward reporting incidents.

Now, Mumbai-based Jaslok Hospital aims to conduct a pilot study to harness this ‘musical’ power to provide a better quality of life for people with the disabling neurological motor disorder.

Parkinson’s disease has no cure, but its deterioration can be slowed down with early treatment. The disease has a lot of movement-related issues as the patients become slow, and suffer from tremors and muscle rigidity. But studies have shown that dancing and even listening to music help modulate emotions, movements, and communication by modifying the brain’s activity.

Dr Paresh Doshi, director of the neurosurgery department atJaslok Hospital, in a statement, said, “It is expected that the patients’ quality of life, mood, cognition, and behaviour is changed when exposed to music and dance. A thorough study examining the positive effects of dance or music and meditation on the quality of life of PD patients, or their caregivers has not yet been conducted. Since there is a lack of research on the impact of dance, music, and meditation in an Indian context, the hospital has proposed to conduct this study.”

In the statement, the hospital further said, “Studies also show that meditation restores one’s sense of self-awareness and helps them to regulate their thoughts and emotions. There is evidence that meditation can reduce psychological distress such as stress and depression and elevate overall mood.”

Parkinson’s disease is a multifactorial disease that affects various aspects, including motor and non-motor behaviours such as mood, cognition, behaviour and quality of life. Doctors believe that conducting an activity of patients’ choice helps to boost dopamine levels and reduce symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.

As the hospital stated, no study has comprehensively investigated the benefit of dance or music and meditation on the quality of life of PD patients or their caretakers. There is also a lack of literature to assess the effect of dance or music and meditation in an Indian setup.

“The results of this study will have a significant impact on how doctors treat this disease and how caregivers manage patients with Parkinson’s disease. If the results of this pilot study are positive, a larger study will be conducted to investigate the effectiveness of dance, music, and mediation therapy on Parkinson’s disease patients,” stated the hospital.

As a result, patients exhibit progressive cognitive decline and/or motor dysfunction. Cognitive decline, for example, is a predominant characteristic of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), whereas motor deficits appear in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Huntington’s disease (HD).





“We currently don’t know how to prevent the neurodegenerative process,” says Dr. Tatiana Rosenstock, neuroscientist and collaborator professor at University of São Paulo, Brazil, and principal scientist at Sygnature Discovery, Nottingham, UK. “In an attempt to stop neurodegeneration, we are trying to understand how and why neurons and other types of cells perish. We believe that this may be the only way to prevent and even cure neurodegenerative diseases.”





These incurable and debilitating conditions are an enormous burden for patients and family members and a substantial medical and public health challenge worldwide. “At present, there is no cure for neurodegeneration, and only a limited number of disease-modifying therapies have been identified,” says Dr. Joana Gil-Mohapel, neuroscientist and assistant teaching professor at the University of Victoria and the University of British Columbia, Canada. “Although the outlook for future patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases may appear bleak, advancements in the past two decades in our understanding of the etiology surrounding neurodegeneration provides optimism.”

Common mechanisms underlying different neurodegenerative diseases

Despite a vast array of causes of neurodegenerative diseases, research has revealed several common pathways through which neurodegeneration proceeds, including accumulation of insoluble protein aggregates, apoptosis, necrosis, excitotoxicity and neuroinflammation. Mitochondrial dysfunction, downstream oxidative stress and impaired autophagy/lysosomal activity are also important factors in neurodegeneration. Rosenstock’s research focuses on how mitochondria in neurons and astrocytes become dysfunctional during neurodegenerative disease.





“The mitochondria produce energy in the form of ATP, which is responsible for maintaining the homeostasis of the brain and all living cells. If the brain lacks energy, cells start to malfunction and eventually die. Thus, we believe that investigating the role of mitochondria in different disorders may be the best strategy for neuroprotection,” explains Rosenstock. Her research group back in Brazil investigates such mechanisms in neurons and astrocytes.





Impaired brain plasticity also represents a critical pathological mechanism underlying the progressive cognitive and motor deficits observed in neurodegenerative diseases. “Brain plasticity, particularly adult hippocampal neurogenesis, exerts an important role in cognitive function,” explains Gil-Mohapel. Her line of research focuses on how plasticity is affected by aging and certain neurodegenerative conditions, such as HD.

Animal models faithfully recapitulate human disease

Gil-Mohapel’s research on neurodegenerative diseases has focused primarily on HD — an autosomal dominant disease caused by mutations in the huntingtin gene. She currently works with YAC128 HD transgenic mice, which express the entire human HD gene containing 128 CAG repeats and show motor abnormalities, cognitive dysfunction and selective neuropathology that mimic the human disease. “We have detected changes in adult hippocampal neurogenesis in these HD mice prior to the onset of motor symptoms and treatment with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a neurotrophin with pro-neurogenic effects, prevented emotional disturbances in early symptomatic YAC128 mice,” explains Gil-Mohapel. “This approach has great translational potential as it can improve the quality of life of patients in early stages of HD,” she concludes.





Rosenstock has also worked with genetic models of HD, including YAC128 mice. She is now working with the ALS SOD1G93A mouse model. “Both HD and ALS models resemble phenotypic and pathological characteristics of the disease, including selective cell death, huntingtin accumulation and decreased levels and activity of the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1),” she explains. These models are prime examples of how targeting neurodegeneration-related genes in mice can be valuable to investigate the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.





The administration of excitotoxins such as quinolinic acid, or mitochondrial inhibitors such as rotenone and 3-nitropropionic acid, reproduces the lesions found in neurodegenerative conditions and also enables the investigation of neurodegenerative disease mechanisms. “This experimental approach allows us to study the correlation between specific disease mechanisms, such as cell death, mitochondrial deregulation and oxidative stress induced by excitotoxins and the development of neurodegenerative processes and behavioral alterations,” says Rosenstock. Lesion models, however, have some pitfalls. “Due to husbandry costs, lesion models primarily use young animals, and the acute insult of administering a toxin does not allow for a progressive pathology and disease progression, as seen in neurodegenerative diseases,” says Gil-Mohapel. “In addition, any potential therapeutic intervention tested in these models is usually administered before or together with the toxin, which does not mimic the time course of most therapeutic interventions,” explains Gil-Mohapel.

A new generation of tools increase the knowledge of neurodegenerative disease pathophysiology

Animal models are powerful tools for understanding the etiology of neurodegenerative diseases. However, they still present limitations and sometimes have poor predictive power for human drug efficacy. These limitations of animals models can be addressed by studying neurodegenerative diseases directly in humans.





“I believe the biggest breakthrough was realizing that some of the mechanisms found in animal models are also found in patient cells, including peripheral blood mononuclear cells or even induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons,” says Rosenstock. She explains that “the use of induced pluripotent stem cells ensures that the genetic background of the donor is maintained, that any drug tested will certainly affect human cells and also minimizes the use of animals following the policy of the animal experimentation called 3Rs — Replacement, Reduction and Refinement.”





Similar to many diseases caused by mutations in a single gene, HD is an attractive candidate for gene therapy. “Specifically, the selective suppression of mutant huntingtin expression is expected to delay the onset and mitigate the severity of HD by preventing the toxic gain of function of the mutated protein without functional loss of its normal counterpart,” says Gil-Mohapel. “Studies using fibroblasts from HD patients combined with gene therapy have also provided promising results, suggesting that allele-specific siRNA-based therapeutics may be clinically feasible and beneficial for a large number of affected individuals,”","Impaired brain plasticity also represents a critical pathological mechanism underlying the progressive cognitive and motor deficits observed in neurodegenerative diseases.

- Age was identified as a significant factor in response. Statistically significant and dose-related improvements in UPDRS Parts II + III were observed in patients under the age of 60.

- NLY01 was safe and well tolerated.

GAITHERSBURG, Md., March 27, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Neuraly, a clinical-stage biotechnology company pioneering development of disease-modifying agents for neurodegenerative disorders, today announced topline results from the Phase 2 trial with NLY01 in patients with early, untreated Parkinson’s disease (PD). The primary endpoint, change from baseline to Week 36 in the sum of MDS-UPDRS Parts II (Motor Experiences of Daily Living) and III (Motor Examination) after 36 weeks of NLY01 treatment, compared to placebo, did not reach statistical significance. NLY01 was safe and well tolerated.

Post hoc analysis of efficacy measures by age groups suggests a treatment effect in younger patients (<60 years). This group accounted for 37 percent of the study population (N=95). In patients <60 years of age, a clinically significant reduction in the sum of UPDRS Parts II and III was observed over the 36 weeks of treatment in subjects treated with NLY01 (an approximate 5-point reduction at 36 weeks, P<0.01 vs. placebo). The effect was statistically significant, dose-related, and appeared persistent over eight weeks after treatment was discontinued. These results suggest slower disease progression in NLY01-treated subjects compared to placebo-treated subjects in this age group. Detailed data will be presented at future medical meetings.

The Phase 2 study enrolled 255 patients across 55 clinical sites in the United States and Canada. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial is designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of NLY01 in subjects with early PD. Enrolled patients were randomized to receive either weekly injections of NLY01 (2.5 mg or 5.0 mg) or placebo for 36 weeks. Clinical assessments were made periodically during treatment and again eight weeks after treatment was discontinued. More information about the ongoing Phase 2 study of NLY01 in PD is available at www.clinicaltrials.gov under the identifier NCT04154072.

Story continues

""Although the study didn’t meet its primary endpoint, it is intriguing that NLY01 demonstrated a beneficial effect in patients under 60. This potentially may represent interest for further clinical evaluation of NLY01 in younger Parkinson’s patients,"" said Viktor Roschke, Head of R&D at Neuraly.

Seulki Lee, CEO of Neuraly, also mentioned that the company will thoroughly analyze the data from the study to better understand the outcomes and determine the next steps for NLY01.

About NLY01

NLY01 is a proprietary long-acting analogue of exendin-4, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist that slows progression in animal models of Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease. In clinically relevant animal models, NLY01 prevented neuronal cell death by inhibiting microglial activation and forming neurotoxic reactive astroglial cells. Treatment with NLY01 slowed disease progression, improved motor and cognitive functions, and extended the lifespan in mice with Parkinson’s disease. NLY01 penetrates the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in animal models, and its receptor (GLP-1R) is highly expressed on glial cells. NLY01 is being developed as a potentially disease-modifying agent for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s.

44,44,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/climate-change-extreme-weather-may-have-complex-effects-on-disease-transmission,What will be the effects of climate change on disease transmission?,"Share on Pinterest New research explores the effects of climate change on disease transmission in a crustacean model. Bisual Studio/Stocksy Researchers investigated the effects of different temperature regimes on a crustacean model of disease transmission.

They found that different temperature regimes affect disease transmission in complex ways.

They concluded that further research into how temperature regimes affect host-pathogen dynamics is crucial for predicting the effects of climate change on human and environmental health. Researchers predict that climate change will increase the Earth’s mean temperature, cause temperature fluctuations, and increase the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. How these changes will affect infectious disease and impact human health , agriculture , and wildlife remains to be seen. Research shows that temperature variance can modify host-pathogen dynamics. One study found that daily temperature fluctuations increase malaria transmission, and another suggested that short-term temperature fluctuations led to reduced transmission. Further research shows that how extreme heat events affect host-pathogen dynamics may also depend on the magnitude, duration, and intensity of the heatwave. For example, one study investigating a parasitoid-insect interaction found that a heatwave increase of 5°C increased parasitoid size while a 10°C increase reduced parasitoid growth. Knowing how host-pathogen dynamics respond to temperature variation could help researchers and policymakers alike prepare for the effects of climate change. In a recent study, researchers led by Dr. Pepijn Luijckx, assistant professor in parasite biology at Trinity College Dublin, Ireland, investigated the effects of different temperatures on the host-pathogen dynamics. They found that temperature variation alters pathogen-host interactions in complex ways that may affect disease dynamics in an unanticipated manner. “Here, we show that temperature variation with each of the traits we measured […] responds in a unique way to different types of temperature variation,” Dr. Luijckx told Medical News Today. “Given that our mathematical models for disease spread rely on numerous variables, and our results show that each of these may respond in a unique way to both changes in temperature mean and variance, predicting how global warming may alter diseases may be incredibly complex.” The study appears in eLife.

Daphnia magna For the study, the researchers examined the effects of different temperatures on small crustaceans called Daphnia magna alongside its gut parasite, Ordospora colligata. Researchers frequently use Daphnia in ecological model system research, and Ordospora transmission is representative of classical environmental transmission, similar to viral infections such as SARS-CoV-2. They then subjected the crustaceans alongside their parasites and a placebo infection as a control to three temperature regimes for 27 days: constant temperature regimes ranging from 50 ° F (10 ° C) to 82.4 ° F (28 ° C)

F (10 C) to 82.4 F (28 C) daily temperature fluctuations ±3°C

constant temperature regime with a 3-day heatwave rising temperatures by 6°C The team selected the temperature regimes to mimic temperature events that occur in the study subjects’ natural environments, such as rock pools and small ponds. Altogether, the researchers observed temperature effects in 492 individuals. During the experiment, they assessed host longevity, fecundity — the ability to produce offspring, infection status, and the number of Ordospora spores within the host gut. The researchers found that, regardless of temperature regime, Ordospora reached optimal performance at roughly 66.2°F (19°C). While there was a reduction in infectivity and spore burden among Ordospora-exposed Daphnia in fluctuating temperatures, the infectivity of parasites following a heatwave was almost the same as those maintained at a constant temperature. The researchers noted that the effects of temperature variation differ depending on the average background temperature and how close this is to the optimum temperature. For example, spore burden at 60.8°F (16°C) differed by almost an order of magnitude between fluctuating temperature regimes — at 86 spore clusters — and heatwaves: 737 spore clusters. “That a heatwave of 6°C above ambient can lead to an almost 10-fold higher level of disease burden at 16℃ when compared to fluctuating temperatures was remarkable,” said Dr. Lujickx. “Moreover, that this same heatwave, when applied to different mean temperatures, led to either no difference with fluctuating temperatures or even an opposite outcome was unexpected.” Host fitness was generally reduced by exposure to Ordospora spores or experience of a variable temperature regime. The researchers found that Ordospora-exposed Daphnia experienced a reduction in reproductive success of 8% in constant temperatures and 24% in daily fluctuation when compared with controls without Ordospora. This, they say, means that under some circumstances, the parasites may be able to acclimatize to new temperatures faster than their hosts.

Temperature variability hypothesis To explain their results, the researchers noted that, according to the temperature variability hypothesis, as parasites are smaller than their hosts, they, in turn, have a faster metabolic rate. In unpredictable environments, such as a heatwave, parasites would therefore have an advantage over their hosts. They noted that host resistance might also decrease due to a trade-off between energy demand for acclimatization and immunity from thriving pathogens. Dr. Luijckx said that while this is the most promising explanation, some aspects of their findings remain unclear: “While this theory can explain the observed increase in the number of spores of the pathogen at 16℃, it cannot, however, explain why we see that the outcome depends on the mean temperature. Other theories, however, have suggested that when the disease has a smaller temperature tolerance than its host, this may lead to a reduction in disease performance at temperatures that exceed its tolerance.” The researchers concluded that improving their understanding of temperature variation on host-parasite dynamics is critical for predicting disease dynamics as the climate changes.

Study limitations The team noted several limitations to their findings. Dr. Luijckx explained that as they only conducted their experiments on one species of water flea and a single disease, they are unsure if their findings may apply to other organisms and lead to higher levels of disease in livestock, agriculture, or disease vectors. He added: “Moreover, our study was conducted at an individual level. To fully understand disease outbreaks and dynamics, we would need to test how temperature variation and extreme weather affect diseases at a population level. We are planning to do such experiments soon.” “We have to be careful in extrapolating these results to homeotherms like people, whales, and larger charismatic endangered species,” Dr. Joseph K. Gaydos, VMD, Ph.D., chief scientist at the University of California, Davis School of Veterinary Medicine, told MNT. Dr. Gaydos was not involved in the study. “Still, that said, what happens to very small, even microscopic creatures has a huge effect on much larger species. Imagine what parasitic changes in krill — a small oceanic poikilothermic plankton — could do to krill populations and how that could affect whales that eat krill,” he continued.","Share on Pinterest New research explores the effects of climate change on disease transmission in a crustacean model.

The plan is one of Russia's clearest nuclear signals since the start of its invasion of Ukraine 13 months ago, and Ukraine called for a meeting of the United Nations Security Council in response.

""Russia's nuclear rhetoric is dangerous and irresponsible,"" NATO spokeswoman Oana Lungescu said on Sunday.

""NATO is vigilant and we are closely monitoring the situation. We have not seen any changes in Russia's nuclear posture that would lead us to adjust our own.""

In his comments on Saturday, Putin likened the move to the United States stationing its weapons in Europe, while insisting that Russia would not violate its nuclear non-proliferation promises.

While Washington, the world's other nuclear superpower, played down concerns about Putin's announcement, NATO said that the Russian president's non-proliferation pledge and his description of US weapons deployment overseas were way off the mark.

""Russia's reference to NATO's nuclear sharing is totally misleading. NATO allies act with full respect of their international commitments,"" Lungescu said in a statement. ""Russia has consistently broken its arms control commitments.""

A top security adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Oleksiy Danilov, said that Russia's plan would destabilise Belarus, which he said had been taken hostage by Moscow.

Lithuania said on Sunday that it would call for new sanctions against Moscow and Minsk in response to Russia's plan.

Lithuania will ask for the additional sanctions to be included in a package of penalties being discussed in Brussels, the foreign ministry's spokesperson said.

Experts said Russia's move was significant since it had until now been proud that unlike the United States, it did not deploy nuclear weapons outside its borders. It may be the first time since the mid-1990s that it has done so.

Mykhailo Podolyak, another senior Zelenskyy adviser, on Sunday scoffed at Putin's plan on Twitter.

""He admits that he is afraid of losing & all he can do is scare with tactics,"" Podolyak tweeted.

Tactical nuclear weapons refer to those used for specific gains on a battlefield rather than those with the capacity to wipe out cities. It is unclear how many such weapons Russia has, given it is an area still shrouded in Cold War secrecy.

UKRAINE URGES UN MEETING

Ukraine's foreign ministry called for an extraordinary meeting of the UN Security Council after Putin's announcement, and it asked the international community to ""take decisive measures"" to prevent Russia's use of nuclear weapons.

""Russia once again confirms its chronic inability to be a responsible steward of nuclear weapons as a means of deterrence and prevention of war, not as a tool of threats and intimidation.""

The European Union joined the chorus of condemnation on Sunday, with its foreign policy chief Josep Borrell urging Belarus not to host the weapons and threatening further sanctions.

Analysts at the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War said the risk of escalation to nuclear war ""remains extremely low"".

In Washington, Representative Michael McCaul, the Republican chairman of the US House of Representatives foreign affairs committee, said he regarded Russia's plan as disturbing and designed to intimidate the West.

""I think this is sabre-rattling on the part of Putin basically to try to frighten,"" McCaul told the Fox News Sunday programme. ""These tactical nukes are disturbing.""","KYIV: The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) castigated Vladimir Putin over his nuclear rhetoric a day after the Russian president said he planned to station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, escalating a stand-off with the West.
""Russia's nuclear rhetoric is dangerous and irresponsible,"" NATO spokeswoman Oana Lungescu said on Sunday.
We have not seen any changes in Russia's nuclear posture that would lead us to adjust our own.""

47,47,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/carbon-tax-net-zero-target-emissions-singapore-green-plan-2506496,Budget 2022: Singapore to progressively raise carbon tax to reach net-zero target 'by or around mid-century',"Currently, the country’s carbon tax rate – which is applied on facilities that directly emit at least 25,000 tCO2e of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per year – is set at S$5 per tonne until 2023.

Mr Wong said the revised carbon tax trajectory will push businesses and individuals “to internalise the costs of carbon, and take actions to moderate their emissions”.

To give businesses time to adjust, the Government will pace the increase in carbon tax between now and 2030. The rate will be increased to S$25 per tonne in 2024, and again in 2026 to S$45 per tonne.

Subsequent increases will also be announced “ahead of time” to provide certainty for businesses, said Mr Wong.

He added that the Government will not impose an additional carbon tax on the use of petrol, diesel, and compressed natural gas, as these already have excise duties that encourage users to moderate their fuel consumption and emissions.

Fuel excise duties will continue to be reviewed and adjusted periodically, he said.

SUPPORTING BUSINESSES AND HOUSEHOLDS

Despite the increase in carbon tax, Mr Wong clarified that he did not expect to derive additional revenue.

“A large part of the revenue will be used to support decarbonisation efforts through investments into new low-carbon and more energy-efficient solutions,” he said. “These investments will help to lower our emissions, and bring us closer towards our net-zero goal.”

In addition, with households expected to see increased utility bills due to the higher carbon tax, Mr Wong said “some of the revenue” will go towards cushioning the impact of the carbon tax increase.

""At $25 per tonne (of emissions), this will translate to an increase of about S$4 per month in the utility bills for an average four-room HDB household,"" said Mr Wong.

To help households, the Government will provide support such as additional U-Save rebates during the transition. More details will be announced next year, ahead of the carbon tax increase in 2024, added Mr Wong.

He noted that businesses in emissions-intensive and trade-exposed sectors, such as electronics and energy and chemicals, may face higher costs than those in countries with lower or no carbon tax.

Some will also need a little more time to make the necessary reduction in emissions or investment in cleaner technologies, he said.

To support such firms and manage the near-term impact on their competitiveness, Mr Wong said a framework that will provide existing companies with allowances based on efficiency standards and decarbonisation targets will be put in place.

“This will help mitigate the impact on business costs, while still encouraging decarbonisation,” said Mr Wong, adding that the Government will continue to engage affected companies on the design of the transition framework prior to its implementation in 2024.

Businesses will also be able to use high-quality international carbon credits to offset up to 5 per cent of their taxable emissions from 2024.

Mr Wong said this will also help to create local demand for high-quality carbon credits and catalyse the development of well-functioning and regulated carbon markets.

In a press release on Friday, the National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS) said it will continue to financially support businesses’ decarbonisation efforts through existing schemes like the Resource Efficiency Grant for Energy and the Energy Efficiency Fund for companies undertaking energy efficiency and emissions reduction projects.

It added that the Government is also reviewing support measures for businesses to implement needle-moving decarbonisation solutions to make them more competitive in the medium term.","Mr Wong said the revised carbon tax trajectory will push businesses and individuals “to internalise the costs of carbon, and take actions to moderate their emissions”.

This is what is called a Mediterranean diet and works just as well for women as it does for men. So far, all studies about the cardio-protective virtues of a Mediterranean diet have looked at men but a new study by the University of Sydney has found it can cut heart disease risk in women by 24 per cent. It has also reported a 23 per cent lower risk of mortality.

WHY IS THE DIET STUDY ON WOMEN SIGNIFICANT?

That’s because this is among the few researches on dietary impacts on both genders. Besides, researchers extracted big data on more than 7,20,000 female participants in 16 previously published studies, exploring the link between heart disease and diet. “There’s no ‘one-diet-fits-all,’ but there are key heart-friendly foods and nutrients that may make the Mediterranean diet particularly beneficial to help reduce the risk of future cardiovascular events,” said senior study author Sarah Zaman, PhD, an academic interventional cardiologist and associate professor at the University of Sydney in Australia, in a release. “Diet plays a huge role in preventing cardiovascular events and early deaths. Poor diet is linked with many lifestyle-related risk factors of heart disease like obesity, high blood pressure and Type 2 diabetes,” she added.

The study is also significant because heart attacks are always seen as a male problem rather than a female one and the rising numbers of women experiencing a heart episode, even during their reproductive age, are an emerging cause of concern. In the UK, according to the British Heart Foundation, coronary heart disease kills more than twice as many women as breast cancer.

THE ROLE OF DIET

How does a Mediterranean diet reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease? “The Mediterranean diet has consistently been known to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality as well as surrogate markers in cohort studies, randomised control trials and meta-analyses. The Mediterranean diet is known to be the most evidence-based diet to prevent chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease. The diet has become the standard template for healthy eating. The primary advantage of the diet is the quantum of cardio-protective nutrients and foods. These help reduce blood pressure, lipids, endothelial dysfunction, glucose, BMI and waist circumference by providing increased nitric oxide, antioxidant properties, and anti-inflammatory effects,” says Dr Prashant Pawar, Consultant Interventional Cardiologist, Fortis Hiranandani Hospital, Mumbai.

According to Mayo Clinic, a Mediterranean diet works because it is mostly plant-based and comprises healthy fats. “The foundation of the Mediterranean diet consists of vegetables, fruits, herbs, nuts, beans and whole grains. Meals are built around these plant-based foods… Healthy fats are a mainstay of the Mediterranean diet. They’re eaten instead of less healthy fats, such as saturated and trans fats, which contribute to heart disease. Olive oil provides monounsaturated fat, which has been found to lower total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Nuts and seeds also contain monounsaturated fat. Fatty fish, such as mackerel, herring, sardines, albacore tuna, salmon and lake trout, are rich in Omega-3 fatty acids, a type of polyunsaturated fat that may reduce inflammation in the body. Omega-3 fatty acids also help decrease triglycerides, reduce blood clotting, and decrease the risk of stroke and heart failure,” its advisory goes.

CAN THERE BE INDIA-SPECIFIC DIETS?

“The Indian version of the diet is not difficult to recreate as we have many ingredients and superfoods that can make our platter balanced, nutritious, colourful, diverse and filled with various textures and flavours,” says Dr Pawar. He suggests plant-based carbohydrates like whole grains, vegetables, fruits, legumes and nuts. Fish and poultry, he says, can be consumed at least twice in a week. Use olive or canola oil instead of butter and replace salt with herbs and spices. Keep your body hydrated by drinking a lot of water and fresh juices. “Whole grains are packed with fibre, antioxidants and energy, which are not only anti-inflammatory but bear quite a bit of the dietary demand. Whole grains should not be a problem as we are used to brown rice, oats, wheat, quinoa, millets, jowar and ragi. Opt for multigrain breads or multigrain flours. Have five to six servings of complex carbohydrates a day,” advises Dr Pawar.

He even goes so far as to suggest a green Mediterranean diet, minus fish and seafood, as the best for “managing body weight, reducing the risk of cancer, improving gut and brain health, lowering blood pressure and reducing insulin resistance in both men and women.”

In the end, he says, the diet only goes halfway in helping you meet your heart-healthy goals unless it is matched with regular and moderate exercise.","This is what is called a Mediterranean diet and works just as well for women as it does for men.

More than 10 percent of children in Japan who developed acute brain syndrome after infection with COVID-19 have died, results of a nationwide survey recently announced by a health ministry research team has shown.

The survey identified 34 cases of acute encephalopathy associated with COVID-19 infection among those under 18 between January 2020 and May 2022. The team analyzed 31 patients who did not have any underlying illnesses that could be responsible for causing the brain disease.

While 19 of the 31 children recovered, four died, and eight were confirmed with complications. Of the eight, five were reported as having severe aftereffects, including unconsciousness and being bedridden in need of care.

Primary initial symptoms included seizures, which were experienced by about half of the patients, impaired consciousness, and abnormal speech or behavior.

""We would advise going to a hospital quickly...if convulsions occurring with a fever don't stop in 10 minutes, loss of consciousness continues, or strange behavior is noticed,"" said Junichi Takanashi, a professor in pediatric neurology at Tokyo Women's Medical University Yachiyo Medical Center, who led the research team.

Most of the patients developed acute encephalopathy in January 2022 or later, when the Omicron strain of the coronavirus became prevalent.

But there was no major difference in the ratio of those who developed the brain symptoms among COVID-infected children before and after 2022, indicating that Omicron is not necessarily making it easier for the brain disease to develop, according to the study.

Members of the ruling Scottish National Party (SNP) will wrap up two weeks of voting at noon (11am GMT), with the result to be announced later in the day.

Finance minister Kate Forbes and health minister Humza Yousaf are favourites in the three-way race, according to an Ipsos poll conducted between Mar 17 and Mar 21.

Ash Regan, a former minister in Sturgeon's Cabinet, is an outsider in the contest.

At her last session in the Scottish parliament as first minister last Thursday, Sturgeon said that her successor would be either the second woman in the post or the first from a minority ethnic background.

""Either way, that will send the very powerful message that this, the highest office in the land, is one that any young person in Scotland can aspire to,"" she added.

Whoever wins takes over as support stagnates for the SNP's central policy - independence for Scotland - that Sturgeon has championed.

""DISAPPOINTED""

Polling indicates that around 45 per cent of Scots are currently in favour of Scotland leaving the United Kingdom, after 55 per cent of Scots rejected such a move in a 2014 vote.

""I think many of us are disappointed that there hasn't been more of a sustained movement in support of independence,"" said Forbes, who at 32 would become one of the world's youngest political leaders if she wins.

""I think it's for the people of Scotland to determine when they want to become an independent country,"" she told a candidates' debate last week.

""There is no path to independence without persuading 'no' voters to vote 'yes'.""

For Yousaf, 37, too much time had been spent pointing out the UK government in London's failures and not enough on creating a vision for an independent Scotland.

He promised a civic movement to drive the campaign.

Regan, 49, has proposed a commission to run the independence campaign separately from the Scottish government.

According to Ipsos, Forbes has the most support among the general public, with 27 per cent showing a favourable opinion of her compared to 22 per cent for Yousaf and 14 percent for Regan.

Among the SNP membership, which decides on the leader, 38 per cent view Yousaf favourably, compared to 37 per cent for Forbes and 22 per cent for Regan.

Forbes has come under the spotlight for her conservative views as a member of the Free Church of Scotland, which opposes abortion and same-sex marriage.

(WAFB) - March is National Kidney Month, and doctors are using the next few weeks to bring awareness to one of the deadliest diseases in the country.

Louisiana ranks first per capita in incidences of Chronic Kidney Disease, according to the National Kidney Foundation of Louisiana. A recent report revealed over 460,000 people are diagnosed, over 16,000 are on dialysis, and 1,800 are on the waiting list for a live-saving transplant.

Chronic Kidney Disease is the eighth leading cause of death in the state.

“Louisiana ranks at the very top, per capita,” said Dr. Michael Roppolo, a nephrologist for Renal Associates of Baton Rouge.

Dr. Roppolo said chronic kidney disease causes more deaths than breast and prostate cancer each year.

Between the millions of people in the country with this disease, experts say there are millions of others who have it but just don’t know.

Dr. Roppolo said that’s because some symptoms can go unnoticed.

“You really don’t have any symptoms until it’s too late,” said Dr. Roppolo.

Symptoms include diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, and family history.

Experts say people of African American, Hispanic, Native American, Asian, or Pacific Islander descent are at an increased risk for developing the disease. African Americans are three times more likely than Whites, and Hispanics are nearly 1.5 times more likely than non-Hispanics to develop end-stage renal disease (kidney failure).

”Family history. If someone has a family history, don’t ignore it,” said Dr. Roppolo.

To make things even more complicated, the transplant list is growing, but the number of donors is shrinking.

Doctors are urging people to consider donating a kidney to a family member, a friend, or to someone that needs your “spare.” Living organ donors help others by giving them a second chance at life.

“The need for transplants, and the waiting list is growing,” said Dr. Roppolo. “We need more people to consider becoming organ donors.”

Jolyon Attwooll 10/03/2022 4:22:44 PM An AJGP editorial last year highlighted the abject failure in closing the gap for rheumatic heart disease. Since then, the divide has widened further still.

Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have the world’s highest rates of acute rheumatic fever.

WARNING: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander readers are advised that this article refers to people who have died.



This week’s Four Corners was particularly hard to watch for Janelle Speed.



The investigative journalism program focused on a remote corner of north-west Queensland, and the deaths of several members of the Aboriginal community from rheumatic heart disease (RHD).



It is an illness Ms Speed, an Aboriginal cultural consultant, had addressed in an editorial written in the Australian Journal of General Practice (AJGP) less than a year ago.



The ABC program highlighted the distressing case of Betty Booth, an 18-year-old diagnosed with RHD – an entirely preventable disease that now barely exists among white Australians.



Despite making multiple visits to nearby Doomadgee Hospital, Ms Booth never received the care she needed and subsequently died in September 2019.



Within 12 months, two other women in the community had also died from the same illness, despite also seeking care at the hospital.



The program, ‘Heart Failure: An investigation into the hidden killer in remote Australian communities’ drew attention to the increasing incidence of RHD in the area, which is currently at ‘a rate higher than sub-Saharan Africa’, according to presenter Louise Milligan.



For Ms Speed, a Biripi/Dhungutti woman, the problem has been anything but hidden. The editorial she co-wrote in AJGP was borne of her frustration that the illness not only still existed but had become even more prevalent.



It highlighted a 10-year review of the Closing the Gap initiative in 2018 that showed no improvement in outcomes for the disease – and reported statistics showing the problem had worsened.



‘Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Australia have the world’s highest rates of acute rheumatic fever [ARF]/RHD,’ Ms Speed wrote.



Assessing acute rheumatic fever which leads to RHD, as ‘a pivotal example of the need for early diagnosis’, she said the disease is a prime example of a condition that is easily treatable with ‘low-tech solutions readily available’.



In an article on the clinical approach to preventing ARF in the same edition of AJGP, authors also highlighted the extraordinary inequities in the disease’s presence in Australia.



‘It is unlikely that such a stark contrast between two populations living within the same national borders exists for any other disease or on any other continent,’ they wrote.



Ms Speed told newsGP she could not bring herself to watch Four Corners immediately, as she knew how confronting its contents would be. When she finally did, it was in the morning to reduce the risk of it disrupting her sleep – and her response was as she had feared.



‘What I thought is … that’s extremely sad, but unfortunately, that’s extremely common,’ she said.



The issue has a particularly personal resonance for Ms Speed, not just as a First Nations woman but also directly in her family.



One of nine siblings, Ms Speed said her brother is among those who developed RHD as a teenager and has had to live with the debilitating impact – including heart attacks and quadruple heart bypass operations.



A bad situation, getting worse

Since she wrote the editorial for the May 2021 edition of AJGP, the situation has deteriorated.



Despite a Federal Government goal of eliminating RHD by 2030, the latest Australian Institute of Health and Welfare figures show the problem is now even more stark.



The editorial highlighted 1776 diagnoses of ARF between 2013–17. For 2015–2019, that total had increased to 2244. Meanwhile, the rate of notifications had increased from 77 per 100,000 in 2015 to 102 per 100,000 four years later.



For Ms Speed, a better coordinated response between different parts of the health system is essential to reverse the decline. The program highlights how, despite a clear diagnosis of Betty Booth’s illness by a paediatric cardiologist, she still fell through the gaps.



Looking beyond clinical aspects and improving cultural competency within primary care and the wider health system are another key, Ms Speed believes.



‘While we focus on understanding the history and self-reflection, we don’t really focus on what culture is and what the cultural biases are,’ she said.



‘Cultural competency is not just about connecting it to culture, it’s about connecting it to health outcomes. We don’t focus on how culture connects clinicians to the issues that Aboriginals have.



‘There’s the perspective that it’s the Aboriginal people who are the problem, not that clinicians haven’t worked out how to better to set the system up.’







Proposed solutions

In its response to the program, the Queensland Health Minister Yvette D’Ath described the women whose stories featured in program as ‘badly let down’ and said their cases are under investigation.



She also announced the state would launch a dedicated rheumatic heart disease strategy, backed by $7.3 million in funding.



Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt also issued a statement, which flagged some developments in the Government’s approach



‘The new National Partnership Agreement on Closing the Gap – to which all Governments committed in 2020 – identifies fundamental reforms to change how governments work with others to achieve better outcomes for First Australians,’ it states.



‘Working in genuine partnership through shared decision-making and co-design with the Aboriginal community-controlled sector is critical and is the foundation of the new approach to the Government’s Rheumatic Fever Strategy commencing this year [2021–22].’



In addition to $25 million committed to support the strategy, Minister Hunt said a further $12 million will be invested ‘to support preventive activities on the ground’. He also cited funding to help the University of Western Australia develop a Strep A vaccine ‘to accelerate the elimination of RHD’.



Ms Speed, in the meantime, remains sceptical but committed to a cause she has campaigned for over many years.



‘The light gets shone on the sad story about chronic disease in Aboriginal communities all the time, the kidney disease, diabetes,’ she said.



‘Now we’ve got rising cancer rates, and on top of it, we’ve still got third world diseases.’



To make progress, she believes greater leadership is required.



‘Everything seems to be focused on the clinical aspect of it,’ she said.



‘Well, where’s some of the focus on the other skills that you need to be a clinician?’



Despite the clear frustrations with an issue she knows only too well, and has now been brought into wider focus by the Four Corners team, Ms Speed holds on to hope that those goals may one day be within reach.



‘I am still here trying to do the same thing,’ she said.



‘I may not be overly optimistic about how it’s gone over the last 30 years though I am optimistic for the future because I think it’s all possible.’



The RACGP has an online course designed as an introduction to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultural awareness in general practice. See: Cultural awareness and cultural safety training.

58,58,https://abcnews.go.com/International/china-orders-51-million-lockdown-covid-surges/story?id=83431247,China orders 51 million into lockdown as COVID surges,"HONG KONG -- China is facing its worst COVID crisis since early 2020, when the world first witnessed an entire population locked down to contain the coronavirus in Wuhan and its surrounding province.

Two years on, it's now sending tens of millions of people into lockdown in the entire northeastern province of Jilin, where 24 million people live, and the southern cities of Shenzhen and Dongguan, with 17.5 million and 10 million, respectively.

China, the last major country to relentlessly pursue a Covid-zero policy, reported 1,437 cases across dozens of cities on Monday. That’s a fourfold jump in a week.

Although record case numbers are testing the resilience of China’s no-tolerance approach, there is no sign the country is willing to pivot to ‘living with the virus.""

The epicenter of the omicron variant outbreak is the Northeastern Jilin province, where 895 cases were recorded, but there are also outbreaks and containment measures in place Shanghai, the financial powerhouse, and Shenzhen, the southern tech hub.

Authorities announced on Monday afternoon that all 24 million people in Jilin province would go into lockdown, including the previously locked down city of Changchun. It's the first provincial lockdown since Wuhan and Hubei in January 2020.

On Sunday, China ordered all of Shenzhen’s 17.5 million residents into a seven-day lockdown, with three rounds of testing. All public transport is halted and all businesses, except essential services, will be closed until March 20.

As a result, Apple supplier Foxconn has shut two of its plants in the area and relocated production elsewhere.

The lockdown and outbreaks threaten manufacturing and tech production in Shenzhen, known as China’s Silicon Valley. It’s home to Huawei and Tencent, and is home to one of the country’s key ports.

Professor Heiwai Tang at Hong Kong University told ABC News that he doesn’t expect these week-long lockdowns to have a significant impact on the country's gross domestic product.

“It seems the lockdowns will be shorter this time with more tracking, which means a short disruption of work and production,"" Tang said. ""If it ends up lasting for weeks it’s another issue, including inflation risks.”

Professor Michael Song from Hong Kong’s Chinese University estimated that the two-month lockdown in Wuhan cost China 2% of its GDP.

There’s immense pressure on local authorities to contain the virus, with state media reporting that the Jilin City mayor and the head of the Changchun city health commission were dismissed from their roles over the weekend.

Shanghai-based virologist Zhang Wenhong called the flare-up “the most difficult moment in the past two years” of China’s efforts to stamp out the virus. Shanghai has so far avoided a full-scale lockdown.

Across the border from Shenzhen, neighboring Hong Kong is also still tackling its deadliest wave yet, driven by Omicron. Hong Kong recorded 26,908 cases and 286 more deaths on Monday, officials said. Hong Kong’s death rate is the highest in the developed world, in part because of sluggish vaccination rates among the elderly.

Mega isolation facilities are being built across the Hong Kong for people with mild cases. One facility, with 3,900 beds, was built in a week. ABC News witnessed several busloads of people arriving at the facility from all over the city.

Self-titled ""Asia’s world city,"" Hong Kong is undergoing strict social-distancing measures and still has strict border measures in place, leading to an expat exodus. Many businesses are closed until late April.

The mental-health strain of the strict lockdown has also becoming apparent. Last month, police reported three suicide attempts in 27 hours at one of the quarantine camps.","Workers set up beds to convert an exhibition centre into a makeshift hospital, following the COVID-19 outbreak in Changchun, Jilin province, China on March 12, 2022.

59,59,https://news.vcu.edu/article/2022/02/state-of-the-university-announcement-to-transform-liver-care-at-vcu,Largest publicly shared gift for liver research in U.S. history to transform liver care at VCU,"Virginia Commonwealth University will radically expand treatment options for liver and liver-related metabolic diseases thanks to a historic, transformational $104 million gift from R. Todd Stravitz, M.D., and his family’s Barbara Brunckhorst Foundation.

This gift is the largest in VCU’s history, the second-largest publicly shared gift to a university in Virginia and the largest publicly shared gift to support liver research in U.S. history — over four times more than the previous largest gift. It will position VCU as a global leader in liver disease and metabolic health research, teaching and patient care.

“Words cannot capture my feelings of gratitude for the transformative gift of Dr. Todd Stravitz and the Barbara Brunckhorst Foundation,” said Michael Rao, Ph.D., president of VCU and VCU Health. “Todd has made history with his incredible leadership and generosity to VCU, supporting an institute that will forever change VCU and catalyze its commitment to our work with the human liver and metabolism. This gift firmly puts the needs of patients first.”

Rao continued: “The institute’s research will have an enormous impact on our lives, changing medicine and our understanding of the role the liver plays in human health. This gift is extraordinarily generous, and it is most certainly generative. It allows us to bring together top teams to deliver clinical care, to ask important questions, develop new tools to explore what causes liver disease and how we stop it, prevent it and even reverse it. Most importantly, it will immediately make a difference in the lives of thousands of people with liver disease. Ultimately, this will positively impact millions.”

Stravitz, a physician-philanthropist in the Department of Internal Medicine at VCU School of Medicine, dedicated his whole career as a liver clinician and researcher to VCU. Before retiring in 2020, he served as medical director of liver transplantation at VCU Health’s Hume-Lee Transplant Center for a decade.

A transformational $104 million gift from R. Todd Stravitz, M.D., and his family’s Barbara Brunckhorst Foundation will advance the new Stravitz-Sanyal Institute for Liver Disease and Metabolic Health at VCU.

Urgent need for research, new treatments in liver disease

About 1 in 10 Americans have some type of liver disease, and it is one of the top 10 factors reducing life expectancy in the U.S. It is sometimes called a “silent killer” because it can go unnoticed until a liver transplant is the only treatment option. In 2021, about three people died on the liver transplant waiting list every day.

“The vision for this institute is to make liver transplant the last, but not the only, option for patients,” Stravitz said. “We will do this by investing in gene therapy and working hand in hand with biotech companies. In the process, VCU will train and educate the next generation of world-renowned liver experts.”

Stopping, preventing and reversing liver disease will have an enormous impact on human health worldwide. (A transcript for this infographic can be found at the end of the article.)

Focus on translational science

The Stravitz-Sanyal Institute for Liver Disease and Metabolic Health at VCU will take full advantage of VCU’s position as one of the nation’s top public research universities and its 50-year legacy of excellence in liver care and research.

The patient-centered institute will bring together and align the work of several entities already dealing with liver disease or its effects on other organs. These include the hepatology and research teams in VCU School of Medicine’s Department of Internal Medicine, VCU Health’s Hume-Lee Transplant Center, VCU Massey Cancer Center and VCU Health’s Pauley Heart Center. Over time, VCU Health will be able to serve twice the patient volume for liver-related illnesses.

Focused on translational science, the institute will grow research and health care teams for liver-related clinical specialties, such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, end-stage liver disease, liver transplantation, liver cancer, women’s liver health issues and rare diseases in hepatology. Arun J. Sanyal, M.D., professor in VCU School of Medicine’s Department of Internal Medicine and a researcher and liver disease specialist at VCU Health, will serve as the institute’s director.

“The liver impacts the health of all other organs because of its central role in metabolism and how the body uses energy. When the liver shuts down, all organs suffer,” said Sanyal, interim chair of the Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition at VCU School of Medicine. “Discoveries of the institute will develop new diagnostics and treatments and inform practice guidelines for liver-related diseases around the world, as well as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer’s and kidney failure. The status quo of how we treat liver disease is no longer acceptable.”

Platform for scientific innovation

Stravitz’s historic gift enables VCU to accelerate implementing several priorities of the new institute, which was publicly launched in December:

Investment in microbiome research, gene editing approaches, imaging tools, digital technologies and data analytics to develop innovative solutions to both rare and common liver diseases, in close partnership with academic and industry collaborators from around the world.

Investment in endowed positions and new degree programs at the graduate, postgraduate and postdoctoral level to foster the development of current and future generations of researchers and clinicians. The institute will be able to recruit 30 to 60 new researchers, faculty and staff — more than doubling the size of the existing interdisciplinary team at VCU dedicated to liver research.

Inclusion of other VCU disciplines in the interdisciplinary approach, such as engineering, nursing, pharmacy, social work, arts and business. The holistic approach allows treating the whole patient by also addressing lifestyle and socioeconomic factors that negatively affect liver health.

The remarkable private gift comes at a time when VCU’s sponsored research is also breaking records, reaching an all-time high of $363 million in 2021 — a 25% increase over the previous three years. The National Science Foundation in December ranked VCU No. 58 of public universities nationwide for federally funded research expenditures, putting the university within reach of its goal to break into the top 50 of its peers.

The gift advances the new Stravitz-Sanyal Institute and positions VCU as a global leader in liver disease and metabolic health research, teaching and patient care. (A transcript for this infographic can be found at the end of the article.)

Sanyal’s research interests include all aspects of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, especially nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, as well as alcohol-related liver disease and end-stage liver disease, for which he has been continuously funded by the National Institutes of Health since 1995. He oversees multiple pivotal global clinical trials and works closely with the Food and Drug Administration on the Liver Forum to accelerate diagnostics and drug development for liver disease. He has also previously served as president of the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease s .

Unparalleled mentorship

“It takes many leaders to enact an ambitious vision like this. At VCU, we have a community of bold and visionary leaders who are extending the human experience to new levels,” Rao said. One of the early champions for the institute was Peter Buckley, M.D., former dean of VCU’s School of Medicine. The institute will operate under the umbrella of the medical school.

“We are on the cusp of changing medicine, but it takes a visionary and mentor like Arun Sanyal to train the next generation of liver specialists and make VCU the No. 1 liver center in the world,” Stravitz said. “This gift is just a means to achieve our goal to better care for patients around the world. A future where patients can undergo gene therapy to repair faulty genes instead of needing a liver transplant would be a monumental win for human health.”

Sanyal holds the Z. Reno Vlahcevic Research Professorship in Gastroenterology, which honors his mentor, who died in 2000. A researcher at VCU Massey Cancer Center, Sanyal is also the associate director of the KL2 program for training faculty in research at VCU’s C. Kenneth and Dianne Wright Center for Clinical and Translational Research, which oversees clinical trials at the university with the help of a $21.5 million NIH grant.

“As a world-class researcher himself, Todd Stravitz exemplifies the power of medical research to make the world a better place,” Sanyal said about his longtime colleague. “With his generous, future-focused gift, Todd is ensuring that VCU’s capacity to attract outstanding minds and produce future scientific leaders is very strong for generations to come.”

The gift also establishes two endowed chairs at VCU’s School of Medicine: the Arun J. Sanyal Endowed Professor of Medicine and the Phillip B. Hylemon Endowed Professor of Medicine and Microbiology.

“This is truly a transformative moment in VCU’s history as a national research university and medical center,” said H. Benson Dendy III, rector of the VCU Board of Visitors. “On behalf of the Board of Visitors, I am tremendously grateful for this historic gift. This generous investment in VCU will accelerate the university's efforts to prevent liver disease and to treat and heal those affected by it. The impact of this gift will be felt by people around the world.”

The institute’s official name is pending approval by VCU’s Board of Visitors.","This gift is the largest in VCU’s history, the second-largest publicly shared gift to a university in Virginia and the largest publicly shared gift to support liver research in U.S. history — over four times more than the previous largest gift.

60,60,https://europe.autonews.com/automakers/rimac-explains-why-bugatti-no-longer-fits-within-vw,Rimac explains why Bugatti no longer fits within VW,"What has been the financial toll of the chip crisis?

For a component that's maybe worth $1, we would pay maybe $10 or $20 or $50 -- and in some cases even $100 -- for a chip just to avoid stopping the production. It has been a huge challenge. We have had to change a few designs and change some components on the cars just because we couldn't get the chips and processors.

Is Bugatti profitable? If not, what's the key to getting there? If it is making money, how will you make it even more successful?

Bugatti actually has been very successful and profitable in the last few years. The previous CEO [Stephan Winkelmann] did a really good job and left me a good company to continue building upon. So, profitability wasn't really the problem for Volkswagen. The problem was, what comes next? Because if you look at Bugatti, it's all based on the W-16 engine, which is almost two decades old. It is an amazing powerplant that created the hypercar business. The easiest thing for us would be to take the Nevera and slam a Bugatti logo on it and call it a day. But I was against it. I'm an electric car guy, but a Bugatti should still have a combustion engine for some time. But it will be developed in a way that is financially viable. We have developed everything in the Nevera from scratch. You will not find one piece in that car that you can find on another car, and we have done that on a shoestring budget compared to what, for example, Volkswagen has invested in the Chiron. We will do the same for future Bugattis, creating really exceptional products that are not comparable with anything else on the market, but without spending billions on them. That's really the key. Also, Bugatti is completely sold out until 2025. This is an incredibly good position to be in.

What kind of powertrain will the Bugatti you develop from scratch have?

It will be heavily electrified, but we'll have a very attractive combustion engine. When people see the next-generation Bugatti, I think they will be surprised that I was pushing for something like that because people associate me with electric cars. But I have always been a performance guy and a car freak. Considering the brand and the customers and the technology available, I think that we are developing the best possible solution for Bugatti, which is not an electric car today. It will be one day, but not today.

Rimac is opening an R&D center near Zagreb that you say will not have fences. What's the underlying message?

Maybe 15 to 20 years ago, if you asked an engineer: ""What's your dream job?"" The engineer would have probably said: ""Working for BMW or Mercedes."" Today, I'm not really sure that's the case. So, the question is: Why do you need fences? Can't you, when you build a facility from scratch, make it nice and still protect the things you need to protect without excluding people? It's about how you involve the community and the surroundings. We have kids driving around here with their little bicycles, looking at how we do things. I would feel terrible if we had to exclude them. We want to be part of the community and also make this the best possible place for employees. They shouldn't have to announce if a friend or their kid is coming over. We are very open as a company, so the things that you need to protect, such as a design for a car that will come out in five years, we protect.

How many supercars has Rimac made since being founded and how will that change with the opening of the new facility, the addition of the Nevera and the addition of Bugatti to Rimac Group?

When we showed our first car, the Concept One, at the 2011 Frankfurt auto motor show, we were eight to 10 people. We were super small and had very limited funding. We built eight of these cars. Now we have moved into the second stage with the Nevera. We just started producing the customer cars. There will be 150 of those, or 50 per year. We are also building 80 Bugattis a year. The combined volumes of Rimac and Bugatti make it by far the biggest player in the hypercar market. We are talking about hundreds of millions in revenues there.

Along with making hypercars, Rimac Group has created Rimac Technology for your components business. What is the plan there?

When I started the company, I wanted to build supercars, but I figured out investors don't really want to invest in that and the revenue will come years and years down the road, because it takes a lot of time to develop the car. How do you survive until then? We started working for other car companies. In those early days, we were doing something like 200 batteries for Koenigsegg, 150 for the Aston Martin Valkyrie. Those kind of things. Today, we are working on projects where we are producing batteries in the tens of thousands and increasing that to hundreds of thousands units per year for big car companies. It's not just batteries, but also powertrains, e-axles and infotainment systems.

Rimac has gone from a handful of people to more than 1,000. What's next?

We realize now that even before the first person moves into our new campus [near Zagreb] we will have outgrown it. We are already thinking about campus No. 2 and No. 3 or creating a megacampus because we are growing so fast. We have a small factory here [near Zagreb] and another five minutes away. We have two other locations for production. We have multiple locations for offices. That's one of the growing pains, being scattered around. You can't imagine how much effort the team and I put in playing a form of [video game] Tetris with all of these locations. It's so inefficient.

What's the solution, preparing to grow to 10,000?

One thing also that I have learned is to avoid making predictions because if I tell you now that we will have 10,000 employees, that's a huge promise to keep. Circumstances sometimes change. But if you don't do exactly what you said three years ago, people will trample on you and say you are a liar. What I can say is that I had an all-hands company meeting before Christmas and I showed them a new plan. I told them, ""I know it looks absolutely insane, but that's the plan."" And history has shown us that we achieve our goals.

What have been the most challenging parts about creating an auto industry from scratch in Croatia?

It's just 12 years, but it feels like several lifetimes. Going from a garage to today with 1,500 people in several countries was a wild ride. In Croatia you don't have any industrial buildings. I looked at every building around here -- even ridiculous things like the old airport and some old factories that were doing something completely different. Therefore, you have to do everything yourself. You take an old shopping center and convert it into a factory or build it from ground up. And getting hundreds of chairs or laptops or whatever, that's the challenge here. Not just because of pandemic. We have always had that problem. Finding talent has also been difficult because nobody had any experience in manufacturing, supply chains and so on. It was pretty tough. But I asked myself: Would it have been a lot easier somewhere else? Probably, yes, but maybe we wouldn't have been around. I guess all of the struggles and everything that we went through had to be exactly the way it was for us to still be around.

What about the biggest challenge from a business perspective?

I would say it was keeping the company alive, be it through fund-raising or bank loans or customer projects. That was my focus most of the time. That has not been the biggest problem in the last couple of years since we have big, significant partners. But we are not over the edge or out of the Death Valley of companies yet.","I'm an electric car guy, but a Bugatti should still have a combustion engine for some time.

62,62,https://www.wired.com/story/australia-media-code-facebook-google/,Australia's Standoff Against Google and Facebook Worked—Sort Of,"Over Zoom, Australia’s communications minister, Paul Fletcher, has the air of a man in the middle of a victory speech. He credits his team and the country’s competition regulator for succeeding where others had failed: forcing tech giants to pay for news. “There were a lot of people saying you can't really succeed in taking on the global digital giants,” he says, sitting beneath strip lighting in his Sydney constituency office. But Fletcher and Australia’s federal treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, persevered. In 2020, when the Australian government asked the competition regulator to develop a law that would force tech giants to pay for the news that appears on their feeds, Fletcher was aware of the stories others used as warnings. When Germany’s biggest news publisher, Axel Springer, tried to block Google from running snippets of its articles in 2014, it backtracked after just two weeks once traffic plunged. When Spain tried to force Google to pay for news in 2014, the search giant just left—blocking Google News in the country for seven years.

Google threatened Australia with even more drastic action. In January 2021, the tech giant suggested Australians could lose access to its entire search engine if Fletcher and Frydenberg’s “news media bargaining code,” which would force platforms to pay news publishers for links, came into force. Facebook also lobbied hard against the code, arguing that news makes up less than 4 percent of the content people see in their news feed. On February 17, Australians woke up to discover that all news links had been wiped off the platform, leaving the Facebook pages of the country’s biggest media companies completely blank. Traffic to news websites sank 13 percent, illustrating exactly what the government said it was worried about. Facebook’s actions “confirm for all Australians [the] immense market power of these media digital giants,” Frydenberg said at the time.

Still, the government did not back down. According to Fletcher, the code was Australia’s answer to a problem that was first and foremost about competition. The argument was simple—Australia’s news industry should be compensated for helping Google and Facebook attract eyeballs. “What we're trying to do is replicate the ordinary commercial dealings that would occur in a market where there wasn't a huge imbalance of bargaining power,” he says.

But others suspect the code was really an attempt to subsidize the media industry, which was suffering from intense online competition for advertising. Out of every 100 Australian dollars spent on advertising in 2019, AD$53 ($38) went to Google, AD$28 to Facebook, and AD$19 to all other websites including media outlets, according to Australia’s competition watchdog. If this was the reason for the code, Bloomberg editors described it as a misdiagnosis in an op-ed. “Journalism’s business model wasn’t broken by digital platforms,” they said, “[the internet] offered consumers a wealth of free news and opinion and gave advertisers options and audiences that traditional publishers haven’t been able to match.”

Australians experienced this standoff through their Facebook feeds. For eight days, the site featured no news. Then, at 1 am on February 26, 2021, news content started to reappear, reversing users’ feeds to how they always looked. But behind the scenes, tech’s relationship with the media had permanently shifted.

Google and Facebook did not leave; they paid up, striking deals with news organizations to pay for the content they display on their sites for the first time. The code was formally approved on March 2, 2021, writing into law that tech platforms had to negotiate a price to pay news publishers for their content. If they didn’t, an arbiter would step in not only to force the platforms to pay but also to set the price. One year after the media code was introduced, Google has 19 content deals with news organizations and Facebook has 11, according to Fletcher.","Over Zoom, Australia’s communications minister, Paul Fletcher, has the air of a man in the middle of a victory speech.

64,64,https://www.technologynetworks.com/diagnostics/blog/driving-change-in-rare-disease-diagnostics-359061,Driving Change in Rare Disease Diagnostics,"Whilst a disease is considered rare if it affects fewer than 1 in 2000 people, collectively these diseases affect a significant proportion of the population – around 300 million people are living with a rare disease. In many cases, rare diseases are chronic and life-threatening, with limited treatment options, and the path to obtaining a diagnosis is often a long and challenging process. Better diagnostic pathways and novel therapies are desperately needed to improve the lives of rare disease patients.





In this two-part interview series, Technology Networks delves deeper into the diagnostic odyssey many rare disease patients face and explores current efforts to develop improved therapies for these patients.





For our first interview, we spoke to Madhuri Hegde, PhD, FACMG, SVP and chief scientific officer, Global Lab Services, PerkinElmer Inc, to learn about some of the reasons for the difficulties in diagnosing a rare disease and the impact this has on patients. In this interview, Madhuri also discusses how advances in genomic testing could help to improve the diagnostic process and what the future may hold for rare disease diagnostics.





Anna MacDonald (AM): Diagnosing a rare disease can take several years. Can you explain some of the reasons for this?





Madhuri Hegde (MH): For some rare disease patients, it will take between 7 and 10 years to receive an accurate diagnosis. According to a 30-year comparative analysis conducted by the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD), during that time the average patient will have had made eight attempts to reach a diagnosis. Other studies show these individuals will have seen more than seven physicians for that diagnosis, and possibly more than double that number of specialists since first exhibiting symptoms. Limited awareness and lack of training and information for physicians are what ultimately make accurately and expediently diagnosing a rare disease so challenging.





Rare diseases are classified as such because they affect a smaller population of individuals. In the United States, each rare disease affects 200,000 people or fewer. Because of this, aggregating information about the symptoms of each and the potential genetic factors that make a person more likely to develop that condition takes time. Geneticists, genetic counselors and physicians from different specialties must all work together to ultimately reach a diagnosis. Another major factor to consider is access to testing and approval/coverage for testing by the insurance company. Testing technologies have evolved significantly but getting access or ordering the right test is not easy.





Other reasons for delayed diagnoses identified in the NORD study include longer wait times to see rare disease specialists, limited communication and understanding about symptoms between physicians, and the commonality of certain symptoms with other conditions. The last of these lead to inaccurate diagnoses, which are believed to affect 10 to 20 percent of rare disease cases.





AM: What are the implications of a delayed diagnosis? Why is it important to reduce the time to diagnosis?





MH: A delayed diagnosis delays appropriate medical management, treatment and other interventions, which in turn creates a whole host of problems. Rare diseases are chronic and can be progressive, so allowing months or years to pass without proper treatment could mean worsening symptoms that impede quality of life. In cases where there is an inaccurate diagnosis, an inaccurate or inappropriate treatment may be prescribed, which offers little benefit and can become a financial burden. In addition to the direct medical expenses incurred by a rare disease – e.g., inpatient or outpatient care, prescriptions and visits to rare disease specialists – there are indirect costs for patients and their families too. Living or caring for someone with a rare disease may limit one’s ability to work regularly. Over time, all of these consequences of a delayed diagnosis can compound mental and emotional stress that already weighs heavily on the patients, their families and other caregivers. That’s why reducing the time to an accurate rare disease diagnosis is so important.





AM: It is now possible to identify a number of rare diseases early through newborn screening programs. Can you tell us more about some of the rare diseases that can be detected in this way and the difference early diagnosis can make?





MH: Newborn screening programs are a great example of the impact that timely intervention for rare diseases can have, and the lessons learned through the implementation of these programs hold great promise for rare disease patients—especially when those programs incorporate whole genome sequencing (WGS). Today there are over 7,000 rare diseases that have been identified using sequencing technologies, and the capabilities exist to conduct WGS of newborns at birth. Using a cord blood, saliva sample, and most importantly a dried blood spot punch collected at birth PerkinElmer Genomics is able to sequence all 22,000 genes in a newborn’s genome and analyze the results against 2,500 genes that have known causation with childhood-onset conditions. That analysis includes the 50+ genes identified as medically actionable by the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG), and could help diagnose lysosomal storage disorders like Pompe disease and Batten disease; Marfan syndrome, which affects a person’s connective tissue; and certain hereditary cancers.





AM: How have advances in genomic and molecular testing impacted rare disease diagnosis in recent years?





MH: Technologies used to diagnose rare diseases are evolving at a rapid pace. This includes omics-based approaches using genomics, transcriptiomics and proteomics. While it once took years to sequence the human genome, next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have shortened that timeline to just a few days. We can expect continued innovation and advances in omics, which in turn may necessitate a re-evaluation of the diagnostic and testing algorithms.





While biochemical testing at birth helps identify and thus treat various health problems before the onset of symptoms, WGS could do the same and with a high-level of accuracy and maybe faster if done at day 0 whereas biochemical testing necessitates a waiting period of 24-48 hrs.





AM: Can you tell us about the advantages that whole exome sequencing can bring to rare disease patients?





MH: Both WGS and whole exome sequencing (WES) are enabled by NGS technologies and unlock information in a person’s DNA about their unique genetic make-up. While WGS investigates both coding and non-coding regions of the genome, WES analyzes just the coding regions (exome). Although it is well-known that certain DNA variations outside of the coding regions (exons) can also affect gene activity and protein production – which in turn lead to genetic predispositions to a variety of conditions – WES services like those offered by PerkinElmer Genomics have faster turnaround time (i.e., 4-6 weeks versus 6-8 weeks for WGS) and could be a more cost-effective option for some patients. The design of WES is critical to success of the test and today WGS can inform WES design by incorporating baits for those regions/nucleotides which have been shown to be causative of diseases. Though WGS is still in its early days of being accepted as a first-tier clinical test, WES is recognized and reimbursed by many insurance companies.





AM: What hurdles need to be overcome to further improve the diagnostic process for rare disease patients?





MH: Improving the rare disease diagnostic process demands a programmatic approach. The test itself is a single piece of the puzzle. While the ACMG has established its recommended guidelines for clinical exome and genome sequencing, the governments and public health authorities of individual countries are responsible for establishing local standards. Genomics England and to a certain extent the Victorian Clinical Genetics Service (VCGS) in Melbourne, Australia, are doing impressive work to advance a programmatic approach and have set a great example for others to follow. In the United States, NIH had funded several newborn WGS programs to assess feasibility, though newborn screening remains the only well-established program. The NIH All of Us program is expected to also give us a programmatic view of deploying population scale genomics programs.





Cost and access to sequencing services are also significant obstacles globally—but hopefully ones that could be lessened over time. It may be another 5 to 10 years before WGS for rare disease diagnostics becomes a universal approach, but there is tremendous work being done today to make that idea a reality.





AM: Will we see the time taken to identify diseases shorten further in coming years?





MH: I am optimistic that in the coming years, we will see improvements in rare disease diagnostics. Along with the aforementioned technological advances, especially in omics and integrating data from genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics, collaborations across the scientific and clinical communities continually add to a growing body of research around the human genome and specific genetic variants that lead to rare disease. Improving variant classification using omics-based strategies could help end the diagnostic odyssey for more rare disease patients around the world. Through PerkinElmer’s foundation and leadership role in newborn screening, omics-based platforms, a global network of laboratories contributing to shared publicly accessible databases like ClinVar, PerkinElmer Genomics is driving this change in rare disease diagnostics.

65,65,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01064-5,"Sex, gender and infectious disease","To date, 36 million lives have been lost in the global HIV pandemic. Of the more than 37 million people living with HIV today, over 50% are women or girls. HIV research has not reflected the burden of HIV infection among women4 and has not consistently achieved the National Institutes of Health’s goals of considering sex as a biological variable1. This lack of representation is at the peril of missing opportunities to identify mechanisms of disease and of deploying treatments that have been inadequately evaluated in both males and females.

Representation of women in clinical trials in HIV has also been impacted by the geographic distribution of the pandemic, with the majority of women living with HIV in under-resourced settings with less participation in treatment and cure trials. Additionally, HIV is prevalent among transgender women, also a minority of trial participants. For transgender women, there is the intersection of sex and gender with a discordance between sex chromosome complement (XY), exposure to feminizing sex hormones, and the specific cultural exposures linked to their gender2. A simplistic strategy of comparing cisgender women from sub-Saharan Africa with cisgender men from other sites is inadequate; the diverse socioeconomic and cultural contexts, ages, HIV virus clade and host genetics confound these comparisons on multiple levels. With these challenges, the underrepresentation of women is unsurprising and the limitations of many existing comparative studies are apparent.

Perhaps less obvious is the importance of considering sex and gender in preclinical studies. Here again, scientific rigor obligates that experimental animal models be tested in both sexes, and that the use of cell lines or human samples should account for the sex chromosome complement of the cells and the sex hormone milieu from which they are taken5. In vitro systems can provide a clean first inquiry into differences, as evidenced by examples from HIV research discussed below.","To date, 36 million lives have been lost in the global HIV pandemic.

The bread wheat cultivars Kariega and Avocet S, and the near-isogenic line Avocet S + QYr.sgi-2B.1 (Avocet 2B) were used to clone Yr27. Avocet 2B was developed by selfing a BC4F2 plant that was selected from backcross material derived from crossing QYr.sgi-2B.1 from Kariega into the susceptible background of Avocet S1. The resultant BC4F6 material was designated as Avocet 2B. The molecular markers Xbarc55 and Xwmc344 were used to verify the presence of QYr.sgi-2B.1 in Avocet 2B. In addition, Kariega, Avocet S and Avocet 2B were genotyped with a wheat 90K iSelect single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array33 and a Wheat Breeders’ 35K Axiom Array34, which confirmed that only the QYr.sgi-2B.1 region, and none of the other Kariega stripe rust QTLs, has been introgressed into Avocet 2B (Supplementary Table 6). An F 2 mapping population (Avocet 2B × Avocet S; n = 345) segregating for a single dominant stripe rust resistance gene (R:S = 254:91, χ2 = 0.348, P = 0.554) was genotyped with the QYr.sgi-2B.1 flanking markers1 Xbarc55 and Xwmc344 to identify recombinants. Identified recombinants were genotyped with additional Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR (KASP) markers derived from polymorphic iSelect and Axiom 35K SNPs between Avocet S and Avocet 2B (Extended Data Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table 7)35. The following Yr27-carrying lines were obtained from the University of the Free State (UFS) and the Agricultural Research Council - Small Grain in South Africa (SA): Selkirk (UFS31b), Kubsa (SA9399), Kauz (SA6643), Opata 85 (SA8997) and Avocet Yr27 (Yr27/6*AvS; UFS31a).

HiFi library preparation and sequencing

High molecular weight DNA was extracted from dark-treated, young Kariega leaves following the protocols of refs. 36,37. DNA purity was assessed on a NanoDrop NP-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies), DNA concentration was measured with a Qubit dsDNA high-sensitivity assay and DNA size was validated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Ten micrograms of DNA was sheared to the appropriate size range (10–30 kb) using a Covaris g-TUBE for the construction of PacBio HiFi sequencing libraries, followed by bead purification with PB Beads (PacBio). Sequencing libraries were constructed following the manufacturer’s protocol using a SMRTbell Express Template Prep Kit 2.0. Libraries were quantified using the Qubit dsDNA high-sensitivity assay, and size was checked on a Femto Pulse System (Agilent). Sequencing was performed on PacBio Sequel II systems in CCS mode for 30 h.

Optical map production

Grains of Kariega were germinated and grown in the dark on wet filter paper for 4 days at 4 °C and 3 days at 25 °C. One gram of fresh root meristem tissue was fixed and treated according to the Plant DNA Isolation Kit protocol (Bionano Genomics) to recover high molecular weight DNA embedded in agarose plugs. Plugs containing DNA were washed in wash buffer (Bionano Genomics) and Tris-EDTA (TE). After a purification step using a PFGE system (Bio-Rad) to remove smaller DNA fragments (90 min; 5 V cm–1; angle, 120 °C; initial switch time, 1 s; final switch time, 3 s; linear ramping), we proceeded to DNA release using gelase followed by a dialysis according to the protocol (Bionano Genomics). DNA quantity and size were estimated using Qubit (Invitrogen) and PFGE (24 h; 6 V cm–1; angle, 120 °C; initial switch time, 60 s; final switch time, 120 s; linear ramping). DNA was labeled using the DLS protocol (Bionano Genomics). Labeled molecules were produced using the Saphyr System (Saphyr Chip G1.2). Data processing was performed using the Bionano Solve v.3.6 software (https://bionanogenomics.com/support/software-downloads).

Omni-C library preparation and sequencing

The Omni-C library was prepared using the Dovetail Omni-C Kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol. In brief, chromatin was fixed in place in the nucleus. Fixed chromatin was digested with DNase I and then extracted. Chromatin ends were repaired and ligated to a biotinylated bridge adapter, before proximity ligation of adapter containing ends. After proximity ligation, crosslinks were reversed and the DNA was purified from proteins. Purified DNA was treated to remove biotin that was not internal to ligated fragments. Four sequencing libraries were generated using Illumina-compatible adapters. Biotin-containing fragments were isolated using streptavidin beads before PCR enrichment of the library. The four libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq X platform to generate 834 million 2 × 150 bp read pairs.

RNA-Seq and Iso-Seq library preparation and sequencing

Total RNA was extracted from seedlings, seedlings at dusk, flag leaves, grains, roots and spikes. In brief, 100 mg of ground powder from each tissue was used for RNA isolation using a Maxwell RSC Plant RNA Kit (AS1500) with a Maxwell RSC48 instrument as indicated in the kit protocol (Promega). Around 20 Gb of 2 × 150 bp reads were generated for each sample. The Iso-Seq SMRTbell library was constructed according to the standard isoform sequencing protocol (Pacific Biosciences, 101-763-800) using the NEBNext Single Cell/Low Input cDNA Synthesis & Amplification Module (New England Biolabs, E6421S) and the ProNex Size-Selective Purification System (Promega, NG2001) for size selection. In brief, 300 ng of total RNA from each of the six developmental stages was used as input for complementary DNA synthesis. Each sample was first barcoded and then subjected to cDNA amplification using 12 cycles. Purified cDNAs were pooled in equal molarity and then subjected to library preparation using the SMRTbell Express Template Prep Kit 2.0 (Pacific Biosciences, 100-938-900) following the Iso-Seq protocol previously referenced. The library was prepared for sequencing by annealing primer v4 with the Sequel II Binding Kit 2.1 and the Internal Control Kit 1.0 (Pacific Biosciences, 101-843-000). One SMRT Cell 8M (Pacific Biosciences, 101-389-001) was sequenced on the PacBio Sequel II system using the Sequencing Kit 2.0 (Pacific Biosciences, 101-820-200). The IsoSeq pipeline (v.3; https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/IsoSeq) was used for CCS generation, demultiplexing and clustering of the six datasets.

Genome assembly and validation

The PacBio HiFi reads were assembled using hifiasm12 (v.0.11) with default parameters. Hybrid scaffolding incorporating the PacBio contigs and the optical map was performed using the hybridScaffold pipeline (Bionano Solve 3.6) with default parameters. For the pseudomolecule construction, the Omni-C reads were incorporated using Juicer tools38 (v.1.6) and 3D-DNA39 (v.180114). In brief, the preprocessing of the Omni-C reads was performed with juicer.sh (parameter: -s none). The ‘merged_nodups.txt’ output file corresponding to the Hi-C contacts with duplicates removed was subsequently used with run-asm-pipeline.sh (parameter: -r 0) as input to produce the ‘.hic’ and ‘.assembly’ files. These files were uploaded into Juicebox40 (v.1.11.08) to visualize the Hi-C map and for manual curation. As a final step, the script run-asm-pipeline-post-review.sh (default parameters) was used to save the final Hi-C contact map and to output the final Kariega assembly (21 pseudomolecules and 1 unanchored pseudochromosome). To validate the genome assembly, we remapped the optical map onto the pseudomolecule using the hybridScaffold pipeline (Bionano Solve 3.6), and the final pseudomolecules were compared with the recent bread wheat assemblies of Chinese Spring (IWGSC RefSeq v.2.1)41 and the assemblies of the 10+ Wheat Genomes Project7 using MashMap42 (v.2.0; parameter: -s 300000–pi 98).

Gene model prediction

Gene model prediction was performed following the method described by Mascher et al.5 with minor modifications, combining transcriptomics data, protein homology and ab initio prediction. First, the RNA-Seq data from the six developmental stages were mapped to the reference assembly using STAR43 (v.2.7.0f; parameter:–outFilterMismatchNoverReadLmax 0.02) and assembled into transcripts with StringTie44 (v.2.1.4; parameter:–rf -m 150 -f 0.3 -t). Iso-Seq data were mapped using minimap245 (v.2.17-r941; parameter: -ax splice -uf –secondary=no -C5), and the redundant isoforms were further collapsed into transcript loci using cDNA_Cupcake (http://github.com/Magdoll/cDNA_Cupcake; parameter:–dun-merge-5-shorter). The RNA-Seq and Iso-Seq transcripts were merged using StringTie (parameters:–merge -m 150) into a pool of candidate transcripts, and TransDecoder (v.5.5.0; https://github.com/TransDecoder/TransDecoder) was used to find potential open reading frames and to predict protein sequences within the candidate transcript set. For the protein homology evidences, we used the translated proteins from the projected gene annotation of the 10+ Wheat Genomes Project7, the IWGSC RefSeq v.2.141 and the Triticeae protein sequences downloaded from the UniProt database (2021_03). All of the proteins were mapped against the Kariega assembly using GenomeThreader46 (v.1.7.1; parameters: -startcodon -finalstopcodon -species rice -gcmincoverage 70 -prseedlength 7 -prhdist 4 -gff3out). Then, we produced ab initio gene predictions using AUGUSTUS47 (v.3.4.0), GeneMark48 (v.4.38) and Fgenesh (v.8.0.0; http://www.softberry.com). In brief, AUGUSTUS gene prediction was performed using a model specifically trained according to Hoff and Stanke49 and a hints file generated using the previously mentioned Iso-Seq and RNA-Seq predictions. GeneMark was used with the option -ET and the intron coordinates calculated with the perl script star_to_gff.pl provided in the GeneMark package. For the Fgenesh prediction, the Kariega pseudomolecules were repeat masked using a de novo repeat library constructed with the Extensive de novo TE Annotator (EDTA) pipeline50 and the TREP database51 (v.19). Fgenesh annotation was performed with the specific Triticum aestivum matrix for the gene prediction. We used EVidenceModeler52 (v.1.1.1) to join all of the gene evidences from transcriptomics, protein alignments and ab initio predictions with weights adjusted according to the input source (Fgenesh, 2; AUGUSTUS, 1; GeneMark, 1; protein homology, 5; transcriptomics, 12). Finally, we performed two rounds of isoform and UTR prediction using the Program to Assemble Spliced Alignments (PASA) pipeline53 with default parameters. Gene models were classified as high-confidence or low-confidence genes according to criteria used by the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium13 and by Mascher et al.5. In brief, protein-encoding gene models were considered complete when start and stop codons were present. A comparison with PTREP51, UniPoa (Poaceae database of annotated proteins from the UniProt database (2021_03)) and UniViri (Viridiplantae database) was performed using DIAMOND54 (v.2.0.9; parameters: -e 1e-10–query-cover 80–subject-cover 80). Gene candidates were further classified using the following criteria: a high-confidence gene model is complete with a hit in the UniViri database and/or in UniPoa and not PTREP; a low-confidence gene model is incomplete and has a hit in the UniViri or UniPoa database but not in PTREP, or the protein sequence is complete with no hit in UniViri, UniPoa or PTREP. Putative functional annotations were assigned to high-confidence and low-confidence genes using a protein comparison with the UniProt database (2021_03). The detection of putative NLR loci on each of the pseudomolecules was performed using the NLR-Annotator pipeline55 with default parameters.

Stripe rust inoculations

Stripe rust inoculations at seedling and adult plant stages were performed with urediniospores of the South African Pst pathotype 6E22A+ (virulent to Yr2, Yr6, Yr7, Yr8, Yr17, Yr25 and YrA; avirulent to Yr1, Yr3a, Yr4a, Yr4b, Yr5, Yr9, Yr10, Yr15 and Yr27)56 and pathotype 30E142A+16 (virulent to Yr2, Yr3a, Yr4a, Yr6, Yr7, Yr8, Yr9, Yr19, Yr25, Yr27 and YrA; avirulent to Yr1, Yr4b, Yr5, Yr10, Yr15, Yr24, Yr32, YrCle, YrMor, YrSd, YrSp, YrSu and YrHVII). In brief, freshly propagated urediniospores were suspended in FC-43 oil (3M Fluorinert FC-43) and then sprayed onto the leaves using a high-pressure air sprayer. After inoculation, the plants were placed in a plastic box (56 × 39 × 42 cm), sprayed with Milli-Q water to maintain a high level of humidity and kept in the dark for 24 h at 4 °C. Then, plants were moved to a growth chamber with a 16/8 h day/night regime with the temperature set to 21/18 °C. At 15 days after inoculation, stripe rust phenotypes were recorded by scanning the leaves at 600 dots per inch on an Epson Perfection V850 Pro scanner.

EMS mutagenesis

EMS mutagenesis of Avocet 2B was performed with a concentration of 0.6% EMS (Sigma-Aldrich, M0880). About 2,000 grains were soaked in water at 4 °C for 16 h, dried for 8 h on filter paper and incubated for 16 h with shaking at room temperature (23 °C) in the EMS solution. Next, the grains were washed three times for 45 min each and rinsed for 30 min under running tap water. Grains were pregerminated on humid filter paper in the dark at 4 °C for 48 h. The pregerminated grains were planted in 24-well trays (six grains per well) filled with Stender potting soil in a greenhouse illuminated with Heliospectra LX602C light-emitting diode (LED) grow lights (20/4 h day/night regime with temperature set to 21/18 °C). Single spikes of M0 plants were harvested, and at least ten M1 progenies per M0 plant were phenotyped at the flag leaf stage with Pst pathotype 6E22A+ to identify susceptible candidate mutant lines, which were validated in the M2 and M3 generations.

Genetic map

Linkage analysis was performed using MapDisto 2.057 with default parameters such as LOD (logarithm of the odds) threshold of 3.0, maximum recombination frequency of 0.3 and removal of loci with 10% missing data. Genetic distances were calculated using the Kosambi mapping function, and the map was created using MapChart58. A graphical representation of critical recombinants of the Avocet 2B × Avocet S population is shown in Extended Data Fig. 6.

PCR conditions

A 20 μl PCR containing 100 ng of genomic DNA, 1× GoTaq Green Master Mix (Promega, M7122) and 200 nM primers was used for various fragment amplifications. Primer sequences are shown in Supplementary Table 7. A touchdown PCR protocol was used as follows: initial denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s; annealing at 62 °C for 30 s, decreasing by 0.5 °C per cycle; and extension at 72 °C for 60 s, followed by repeating these steps for eight cycles. After enrichment, the program continued for 29 cycles as follows: 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 60 s. A 20 μl PCR with Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs, M0530) was performed to verify the Yr27 gene sequence and to clone the silencing fragments following the manufacturer’s instructions. A 5 μl reaction (2.5 μl of KASP Master Mix (Low ROX KBS-1016-016), 0.07 μl of assay mix and 2.5 μl (25 ng) of DNA) was used for KASP markers. PCR cycling was performed in an ABI QuantStudio 6 Flex Real-Time PCR machine as follows: preread at 30 °C for 60 s; hold stage at 94 °C for 15 min; and then ten touchdown cycles (94 °C for 20 s; touchdown at 61 °C, decreasing by 0.6 °C per cycle for 60 s), followed by 29 additional cycles (94 °C for 20 s; 55 °C for 60 s). The plates were then read at 30 °C for endpoint fluorescent measurement.

Candidate gene identification

To identify the candidate gene for QYr.sgi-2B.1, we anchored the flanking markers AX-94723778 and IWA4472 to the Kariega pseudomolecules. Annotated high-confidence genes and putative NLR loci predicted by NLR-Annotator55 at the delimited physical interval were selected as putative candidate genes. NLRs predicted at the target interval were prioritized for further analysis. First, the Kariega NLR sequences were screened for homology using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) to identify the sequence diversity between Kariega and other wheat cultivars. Second, exon sequences of the shortlisted NLRs were amplified from Kariega, Avocet 2B and the ten susceptible EMS mutants. The amplicons were Sanger sequenced to identify and verify EMS mutations. Primers 2BNLR5F3/R8 and 2BNLR5F10/R12 were used to amplify exon sequences of QYr.sgi-2B.1 (Supplementary Table 7).

VIGS

To develop the VIGS probes, the predicted QYr.sgi-2B.1 coding sequence was searched against the Kariega whole transcriptome (RNA-Seq and Iso-Seq) database using siRNA-Finder (si-Fi) software59. Based on the RNA interference (RNAi) design plot, three regions (Si1 (197 bp) in the 5′ UTR, Si2 (200 bp), and Si3 (198 bp) in the coding sequence) were selected for VIGS. The selected probes were verified for specificity using a BLAST search against the Kariega genome assembly (<80% sequence identity for hits other than Yr27). The target sequences were cloned into the pBS-BSMV-γ (BSMV, barley stripe mosaic virus) vector in an antisense direction60,61. Viral RNAs of BSMV–GFP and BSMV–GUS were used as controls, along with the BSMV–Si1, BSMV–Si2 and BSMV–Si3 constructs to infect the plants. In brief, Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 carrying the viral pBS-BSMV-α, pBS-BSMV-β and pBS-BSMV-γ plasmids, with the γ plasmid carrying the VIGS target sequence, was infiltrated into Nicotiana benthamiana. Infiltrated leaves were harvested 4 days after inoculation and homogenized with virus inoculation buffer. The leaf extracts were used to infect 15-day-old wheat plants. Then, seedlings were placed in a growth chamber (60% humidity, 16/8 h light/dark regime with temperature set to 21/18 °C). At the flag leaf stage (approximately 20 days after viral infection), stripe rust inoculation was carried out, and the flag leaves were phenotyped 15 days after inoculation.

Quantitative real-time PCR

Leaf materials inoculated with stripe rust were collected at different time points in five biological replicates for RNA isolation. RNA extraction was done using the Maxwell RSC Plant RNA kit and the Maxwell RSC48 instrument (Promega). One microgram of RNA was used for the first-strand cDNA synthesis using a High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit following the user guidelines (Applied Biosystems, 4368814). cDNA was further diluted 20-fold, and 4 μl of diluted cDNA were used for qPCR (quantitative real-time PCR). qPCR was performed using the 2BNLR5F17/R11 primers (Supplementary Table 7). A 20 μl qPCR was set up and run on the ABI QuantStudio 6 Flex Real-Time PCR machine using PowerUp SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, AS25741). The \(2^{{-\Delta}{\Delta}{Ct}}\) method was used to normalize transcript values relative to endogenous controls Ta.6863 (ref. 62).

Haplotype analysis, Shannon entropy and homology modeling

Yr27 protein versions were retrieved from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) using a protein BLAST search (Supplementary Table 8) and aligned using MUSCLE in Geneious Prime 2019. Haplotypes were classified based on amino acid variations (Extended Data Fig. 5a). To identify residues overlapping functional motifs, the Motif Alignment Search Tool (MAST v.5.3.3)63 was used to predict the predefined NLR motifs64 and LRRpredictor was used to predict canonical LXXLXLXX repeats65. Shannon entropy values were calculated using the Entropy-one tool in the HIV sequence database (https://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/ENTROPY/entropy_one.html). The raw output values were plotted using GraphPad Prism v.9.2.0. The Yr27 amino acid sequence was submitted to the Protein Homology/analogY Recognition Engine v.2.0 (Phyre2) for homology modeling to predict the three-dimensional structure66. The resulting top two Yr27 models comprise residues D87 to L1060 (90%) aligned to RPP1 with 18% identity and 100% confidence, and residues P43 to I977 (87%) aligned to ZAR1 with 22% identity and 100% confidence. The coordinates of RPP1-CJID-ATR1 and ZAR1-RKS1-PBL2 cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures were retrieved from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (7CRC27 and 6J5T67) for further analysis. Based on the structure analysis, graphical illustrations were created in UCSF ChimeraX v.1.3dev2021 software68 using RPP1-CJID-ATR1 as reference.

In a recent episode of The Zoe and Liang Show, Zoe Tay recalled how her friend encountered a 'secret' celebrity couple locked in a rather passionate kiss.

Discussing how celebrities can keep their relationships under wraps by going to different obscure areas of Singapore, Zoe offered an alternative — a friend's home.

""[One way] is to go to a friend's house to spend time,"" the 55-year-old veteran actress said and shared an anecdote about a couple who hid their romance for a very long time despite many people already aware that they were dating.

Zoe then elaborated more on the incident, which took place at a friend's gathering: ""The two of them went to the back of the home. My friend stood up to go to the washroom, and saw that they were French kissing.""

Hearing this, co-host Guo Liang couldn't help but burst into laughter, as did guest stars Jeffrey Xu and Sheryl Ang.

Continuing, Zoe added: ""They then came out from the back and pretended as though nothing had happened.""

Jeffrey, 34, cheekily commented: ""They probably also had lipstick smeared on their faces!""

Zoe didn't provide any clues on who this celebrity couple was, or whether they are still together.

Celebrities and home dates

While the couple in Zoe's story may have been comfortable in a friend's home, it seems that local celebrities do prefer to have quiet dates at home.

[[nid:620187]]

Actress Sheryl, 24, shared: ""I personally don't like to spend time outside, so I'm really okay if [the person I'm dating] comes over to my home, or if I go over to theirs, and we just nua (relax).""

Zoe concurred and said that many local celebrities tend to do the same, including a ""fellow sister"" in showbiz who only just recently got married.

Although Zoe didn't mention any names, celebs who recently got hitched include Felicia Chin, Rebecca Lim and Jayley Woo.

Guo Liang, 52, expressed that dates at home might not be as 'safe' as some celebrities would think.

He recalled how another celebrity couple in the past was photographed by their neighbour while at home — a danger that Jeffrey also recognised to exist.

However, Sheryl didn't feel like this was applicable to her love life.

""I think I'm fortunate in that sense, because I'm not so famous just yet,"" Sheryl admitted. ""I don't have to worry too much about this and whether anyone might figure out who I'm dating.""

He noted how RSF's annual World Press Freedom Index ranked Singapore 160th in its 2021 edition, and questioned if Singapore deserved its ranking, which was one spot above Somalia, one below Sudan, and well below Russia and Myanmar.

""It's baffling to many people,"" he said at the Institute of Policy Studies lecture.

He pointed out that the index is a measure of ""the level of freedom available to the media"". It is not an indicator of the quality of journalism in the country.

""Many of our critics don't make that distinction.""

RSF's view is that Singapore's media laws breach media freedom, Mr Daniel added.

When Singapore passed the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (Pofma) in 2019, ""they punished us by dropping us seven places"".

With the Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Act (Fica) passed last year, Singapore's ranking will drop further, he said.

He was asked if the Singapore media should engage with the people behind the index.

Mr Daniel said that in his many years as editor-in-chief of Singapore Press Holdings' English/Malay/Tamil Division, not once had those behind the index tried to engage him.

If anyone had asked to see him to discuss press freedom, he would have been happy to do so. ""But there is a little bit of opacity in the methodology,"" he said. ""I don't want to rubbish them, they've been doing it for a long time, but there should be some kind of audit of their methodology.""

Of Pofma, he said in his lecture: ""We will run afoul of people who are absolutist and say you can't have a Pofma. If you looked at what Pofma is, it just says you cannot communicate false facts, it's simple, that's it.

""So for everybody else who is doing a good job, talking truthfully, Pofma doesn't affect us.""","He pointed out that the index is a measure of ""the level of freedom available to the media"".

70,70,https://bc.ctvnews.ca/b-c-woman-sues-after-husband-dies-of-undiagnosed-flesh-eating-disease-1.5801801,B.C. woman sues after husband dies of undiagnosed flesh-eating disease,"A woman from Lake Country, B.C., has filed a civil lawsuit against four doctors at Fort St. John Hospital and the Northern Health Authority after her husband and father of her young son died of necrotizing fasciitis, also known as the flesh-eating disease.

Britney Stewart says her 40-year-old husband, Josh Wakely, an experienced welder, went to the emergency room at Ft. St. John Hospital three times in three days while away from home at a work camp in February 2020.

His symptoms progressed each visit, from a severe sore throat on Feb. 24 to crippling back pain by Feb. 26, then swelling and numbness in his hand noted the next day.

“He’s not the kind of guy to go to the doctor and say, 'I’m sick,' so I knew the severity was pretty bad,” said Stewart, who was at home in Lake Country caring for their then two-year-old son Mason.

Stewart says each time he visited the ER, her husband was sent away with medication.

Wakely's back pain was so severe at one point, according to the notice of civil claim, that he'd taken 12 tablets of Robaxacet, seven tablets of Advil, seven tablets of Motrin and one tablet of Tylenol with codeine, and still rated his pain at 10 out of 10.

He was given three medications during that visit to treat what doctors thought at the time was a muscle spasm and sacroiliitis, and was then sent home with some Tylenol No. 3 with codeine, Stewart's lawsuit claims.

Doctors told Wakely his back pain was likely from an old injury, though Stewart argues in her lawsuit that there was no history of trauma, and that his swollen hand could be from power tool vibration.

When his condition continued to deteriorate, Stewart drove the 2,000 kilometres to Fort St. John to pick her husband up and bring him home. When he became incoherent the next day, Wakely was rushed by ambulance to Kelowna General Hospital.

“They put him on life support right away,” said Stewart. “The doctors took one look at him and said they knew it was strep A and that it had turned into flesh-eating disease, and his organs were shutting down.”

Doctors attempted surgery to remove the tissue impacted by the rapidly spreading infection. “They had to take, I think it was 30 per cent of the left side of his body, which there was really no coming back from that,” said Stewart.

Eight days after first visiting hospital with a sore throat, Wakely was dead from necrotising fasciitis, which doctors had failed to diagnose during his three ER visits in Fort St. John.

“It just blows my mind that a healthy 40-year-old man with a sore throat didn’t get a swab done. It seems like such a standard practice in all doctors' offices that I have been to, so why wasn’t it in that ER that day? And I do believe if he got the medication and the antibiotics that day, that things would have been different for him,” said Stewart.

Josh Wakely and his family are seen in a provided image.

Now left to raise their son Mason alone, the 33-year-old mother has filed a civil lawsuit against the doctors who saw her husband at Fort St. John hospital and the Northern Health Authority. She is seeking unspecified financial damages.

“We lost our emotional support system. I lost my best friend, Mason lost his dad, but we also did lose a huge income earner,” said Stewart. “Josh was the sole provider in our family, he was the one who was working. My earning power will never be the same as Josh’s.”

Her lawyer, Keri Grenier, says she’s confident her client has strong case for negligence.

“The allegation is, had they done the steps they should have done out of the gate and over the course of those three visits, that Josh would be here today.""

The lawsuit claims Wakely's death was either caused or contributed to by the negligence of the doctors and the Northern Health Authority.

Their negligence also led to Stewart's ""psychological injury/nervous shock,"" the notice of civil claim says.

""All of the injuries have caused and continue to cause (Stewart) pain, suffering, discomfort, loss of enjoyment of life, temporary and permanent physical disability, and loss of earnings, both past and prospective, and loss of housekeeping capacity.""

Citing the Family Compensation Act, the suit goes on to say Wakely's death caused Stewart and their son a loss of love, guidance, affection and companionship, as well as loss of shared income and inheritance, among other things.

His parents have suffered similar losses, the notice of civil claim says.

The family is suing for general and special damages, past and future health-care costs and other compensation of an undisclosed amount.

In a statement the health authority named in the suit said, “At this time, Northern Health has not been served regarding this statement of claim. NH cannot comment further, as the litigation process is underway.”

The notice of civil claim is dated Feb. 22.

As the case winds its way through the courts, Stewart says she remains focused on her and Wakely’s young son, who’s now four years old.

Image credit: MaaHoo/Stocksy Atherosclerosis involves a buildup of plaque in the blood vessels. It can lead to complications like heart attack and stroke.

Screening for components contributing to atherosclerosis, such as cholesterol levels, is vital in preventing adverse cardiovascular outcomes.

A recent study found that testing for a specific protein, apolipoprotein B-100 (ApoB), may be a more accurate method of predicting atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk than testing for cholesterol levels alone. The health of the heart and blood vessels is vital to body function. Early screening can help people understand their risks and potentially prevent adverse health outcomes. Testing cholesterol levels is important, but another test can further help identify the risk for cardiovascular disease: apolipoprotein B-100 (ApoB) levels. This protein helps transport cholesterol throughout the body. Testing for the level of this protein in the blood may help identify people who are more at risk for cardiovascular disease, even when cholesterol levels are normal. This is the argument that a team of researchers from Intermountain Healthcare — a system of 33 hospitals in Utah — have made at the 2023 American College of Cardiology annual Scientific Sessions (ACC23) in New Orleans. The researchers’ presentation was based on an analysis they had recently conducted.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease Atherosclerosis is a condition characterized by the buildup of plaque in the walls of blood vessels. This plaque can be made of cholesterol and other substances. Atherosclerosis makes it harder for blood to circulate properly in the body. It can lead to several health complications if left unchecked. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is an umbrella term for conditions that can result from atherosclerosis. Heart attacks, strokes, and aneurysms can be examples of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases. Cardiologist at the Texas Heart Institute, Dr. Salim Virani , who was not involved in the study presented at ACC23, explained to Medical News Today that: “Atherosclerosis is a buildup of fat, cholesterol, and other substances inside the artery walls. That buildup is referred to as plaque. Plaque ultimately causes the arteries to become narrow and eventually restricts blood flow. When the plaque bursts, it can lead to a blood clot — and, in turn, increase the chances for a stroke or heart attack. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease includes heart attacks, strokes, stents, bypass surgery or blockage of blood vessels supplying blood to the lower limbs or the brain.”

Understanding apolipoprotein B-100 Because atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease can be deadly, early testing can help people identify and minimize their risk. One area of interest is testing cholesterol levels . High cholesterol levels, particularly low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, can increase the risk for atherosclerosis and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Testing for cholesterol levels can be part of routine blood work. Still, another test, for ApoB, may help further identify the risk for poor heart health. “ApoB, short for apolipoprotein B, is the main protein found in LDL particle which carries ‘bad’ cholesterol as well as other particles that carry bad forms of cholesterol. It moves fat throughout the body and helps it get through the walls of arteries, where it can form plaque,” Dr. Virani explained. “When this happens, it increases [the] risk of heart disease and stroke. Measuring for ApoB is a direct measure of all the particles that could contribute to heart disease within your bloodstream,” he added.

Benefit of testing for ApoB The study presented at ACC23 examined trends in testing for ApoB and how levels of this protein relate to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. The researchers used data from Intermountain Healthcare electronic medical records, looking at when people were tested for ApoB and LDL cholesterol levels. They examined data collected between 2010 and 2022 from 705 individuals whose average age was 56 years. Of the total number, 41% were female. First, they found that the amount of testing for ApoB increased throughout this time frame. They also found that ApoB levels may still be elevated, even when LDL cholesterol levels are in a healthy range. Among their participants, about 46% of them still had elevated ApoB levels, even when LDL cholesterol was less than 70 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), a concentration supposed to be in the healthy range. Study author Dr. Jeffrey L. Anderson explained to MNT: “Apo-B provides unique information beyond LDL-C [bad cholesterol]. At low LDL-C levels, ApoB may still be elevated. Apo-B [according to] other studies is a better risk predictor than LDL-C, so if elevated, it may indicate small, dense LDL (i.e., cholesterol poor), [and] more aggressive Rx is indicated.” I​n other words, when someone has an elevated ApoB level with a normal LDL cholesterol level, they can still be at risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and should be treated accordingly. “These ‘small dense LDL’ particles are still atherogenic,” Dr. Anderson further elaborated. This means that they promote the formation of fat deposits in the arteries. “The implication is that some patients with LDL [under] 70 — especially those with metabolic syndrome, pre-diabetes, or diabetes — may be undertreated,” said Dr. Anderson. “In them, check ApoB, and if ApoB is still elevated ([over] 60 for example), further intensification of lipid-lowering therapy – e.g. with statins or PCSK9 inhibitors — may be indicated.”","Share on Pinterest Should doctors change the way they measure cardiovascular disease risk?

73,73,https://now.tufts.edu/2022/03/15/potential-new-test-diagnosing-lyme-disease,A Potential New Test for Diagnosing Lyme Disease,"For scientists and clinicians alike, one of the Holy Grails for successfully treating and curing Lyme disease is developing tests that identify the disease sooner, show when people are cured of infection, and can diagnose reinfection.

Now, researchers at Tufts University School of Medicine say they have identified just such a testing mechanism. It detects a type of antibody that infected individuals produce against a substance the Lyme bacteria acquires from the host in order to grow. The researchers believe tests to detect these autoantibodies—antibodies that mistakenly target and react with a person's own tissues or organs—could provide clinicians with a way to diagnose the disease sooner, know whether treatment with antibiotics is working, and identify patients who have been reinfected.

Authors of the study, published today by the Journal of Clinical Investigation, are Peter Gwynne, Luke Clendenen, and Linden Hu of the school’s Department of Molecular Biology and Microbiology, and colleagues at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

Lyme disease, which was identified five decades ago along the Connecticut coast and spread across New England and the mid-Atlantic region, affects almost 500,000 people in the U.S. every year. Caused by a bite from an infected tick, it frequently goes undetected unless a person notices the telltale rash that forms around the bite.

“We started this current work to learn how Borrelia burgdorferi acquires key nutrients, like fats, for growth,” says Peter Gwynne, research scientist at Tufts University School of Medicine. Photo: Courtesy of Peter Gwynne

Lyme disease can lead to debilitating long-term complications including arthritis, fatigue, mental impairment, and in the most severe cases, attacks on the heart and brain tissue. Caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, Lyme disease can often be treated with antibiotics. But in 10 to 20 percent of cases, the disease’s effects can persist.

Testing to detect Lyme disease exists, but it has limitations, says Gwynne, the lead author of the study and research scientist at Tufts School of Medicine who received a Tufts Launchpad Accelerator award for his work on Lyme disease.

“Traditional Lyme tests can stay positive for prolonged periods of time after treatment—years or even a lifetime,” he says. “As a result, for some individuals suffering from symptoms that resemble long-term Lyme disease infection, clinicians are never sure whether the patient has persistent Lyme disease, was cured and then reinfected, or was cured and is suffering from something else.”

Targeting Fats to Fight Lyme

“We started this current work to learn how Borrelia burgdorferi acquires key nutrients, like fats, for growth,” says Gwynne. “The Lyme bacteria, despite being a very successful pathogen, is much more dependent than other bacteria on acquiring nutrients from its environment.”

“In the process of our research, we found that the organism takes fats called phospholipids directly from its surroundings in the host, and puts them on its surface,” says Hu, the Vice Dean of Research at the school and Paul and Elaine Chervinsky Professor of Immunology. “That finding led us to look to see if the direct use of a host fat by the bacteria might lead the immune system to recognize it as a foreign substance and create antibodies to it.”

“We found that the organism takes fats called phospholipids directly from its surroundings in the host, and puts them on its surface,” says Linden Hu, the Vice Dean of Research at Tufts University School of Medicine. Photo: Alonso Nichols / Tufts University

What the scientists discovered is that both animals and patients infected with the Lyme bacterium developed autoantibodies to multiple phospholipids. Because autoantibodies can be damaging to the host, these autoantibodies are tightly regulated and tend to disappear quickly once the stimulating factor is removed.

“The antibodies also seem to develop much more quickly than traditional antibodies to the Lyme bacteria—likely because your body has previously created these autoantibodies and downregulated them,” says Hu.

While current testing makes it difficult to diagnose reinfection or successful treatment, “the anti-phospholipid autoantibodies—because of their quick increase and quick resolution with treatment—can fill these gaps as a novel additional test,” Gwynne says. “They may make it possible to tell whether treatment has eradicated the Lyme disease bacteria. And they therefore also make it possible to tell if a patient with a prior infection now has a new infection.”

Gwynne and Hu have a provisional patent pending describing the use of antiphospholipid antibodies in the diagnosis of Lyme disease. Their hope is that if their discovery is borne out by further research, a diagnostic company could begin development of a commercially available version of their test within a couple of years.

Can Persistent Cases Be Predicted?

A bigger question, which was not examined in the current paper, is whether these autoantibodies may identify a subset of patients who will develop persistent symptoms of Lyme disease after treatment. Up to 20 percent of patients can develop persistent symptoms after Lyme disease. Diagnosis of these patients is currently only by clinical symptoms, making it likely that patients with different causes of their symptoms are grouped together.

“Antiphospholipid antibodies are commonly seen in autoimmune diseases like lupus, and are associated with blood clots and persistent inflammation that causes other disease conditions,” says Hu. “Many of the persistent symptoms in patients who continue to have symptoms after being diagnosed with Lyme disease are similar to those autoimmune diseases.”

“If there ends up being a link between having persistent Lyme symptoms and these autoantibodies, this would be the first test that could be used to distinguish a group of patients who have persistent Lyme disease,” he says. “It would allow us to test specific new therapies targeted to a defined mechanism.”","Lyme disease, which was identified five decades ago along the Connecticut coast and spread across New England and the mid-Atlantic region, affects almost 500,000 people in the U.S. every year.

New research from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis shows that this novel MRI approach can identify brain cell damage in people at early stages of Alzheimer’s, before tissue shrinkage is visible on traditional MRI scans.

Alzheimer’s disease usually is diagnosed based on symptoms, such as when a person shows signs of memory loss and difficulty thinking. Up until now, MRI brain scans haven’t proven useful for early diagnosis in clinical practice. Such scans can reveal signs of brain shrinkage due to Alzheimer’s, but the signs only become unmistakable late in the course of the disease, long after the brain is significantly damaged and most people have been diagnosed via other means.

But new research from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis shows that a mathematical analysis of data obtained with a novel MRI approach can identify brain cell damage in people at early stages of Alzheimer’s, before tissue shrinkage is visible on traditional MRI scans and before cognitive symptoms arise.

“This could be a new way to use MRI to diagnose people with Alzheimer’s before they develop symptoms,” said senior author Dmitriy Yablonskiy, PhD, a professor of radiology at the university’s Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology. “The technique takes only six minutes to acquire data and can be implemented on MRI scanners that are already used worldwide for patient diagnostics and clinical trials.”

Published in the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease, the study relies on a new quantitative Gradient Echo (qGRE) MRI technique developed in the Yablonskiy lab to show brain areas that are no longer functioning due to a loss of healthy neurons.

“Using this technique in patients with Alzheimer’s disease, we discovered brain areas that look normal on traditional MRI but look dark on qGRE images, which we attribute to significant neurodegeneration,” said Satya V. V. N. Kothapalli, PhD, a staff scientist in radiology and the first author of the study. “We call them ‘dark matter.’”

While traditional MRI is capable of showing where damaged areas of the brain have decreased in volume, the qGRE technique goes a step further, detecting the loss of neurons that precedes brain shrinkage and cognitive decline.

Alzheimer’s disease develops slowly over the course of two decades or more before symptoms arise. First the brain protein amyloid beta accumulates into plaques in the brain, then another brain protein — tau — coalesces into tangles and neurons begin to die. Finally, tissue atrophy becomes visible on MRI brain scans, and cognitive symptoms arise. People at early stages of the disease can be identified via amyloid-PET brain scans or by testing for amyloid in the blood or the cerebrospinal fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord, but such tests do not provide information on neuronal damage.

The study involved 70 people ages 60 to 90 who were recruited through the Charles F. and Joanne Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center (Knight ADRC). Participants completed extensive clinical and cognitive testing to assess their level of cognitive impairment. The participant group included people with no cognitive impairment as well as those with very mild, mild or moderate impairments.

Each participant underwent either a PET brain scan or a spinal tap to gauge the amount of amyloid plaques in his or her brain. They also underwent MRI brain scans.

Researchers applied the qGRE MRI technique to scan the hippocampus, the brain’s memory center and one of the earliest affected brain regions in Alzheimer’s. Results showed the hippocampus often contained a viable tissue section with relatively preserved neurons and a dark matter dead zone virtually devoid of healthy neurons.

These dark matter areas were present in people who tested positive for amyloid but were not yet experiencing symptoms, and they grew larger as the disease progressed. Compared with traditional MRI measures of brain atrophy, biomarkers for dark matter correlated much better with individual cognitive scores for very mild to moderate dementia.

The study builds on and corroborates findings from Alzheimer’s research that took place at Washington University more than two decades ago when Alzheimer’s was formally diagnosed only through autopsy.

In 2001, John C. Morris, MD, the Harvey A. and Dorismae Hacker Friedman Distinguished Professor of Neurology and director of the Knight ADRC, led a study that examined the brain tissue of deceased Alzheimer’s patients and found that damaged brain regions had begun to lose healthy neurons well before the disease caused a significant loss of brain volume in these areas.

Then, in the early 2000s, Tammie L. S. Benzinger, MD, PhD, a professor of radiology and of neurosurgery, and the Knight ADRC’s director of imaging studies, was among the pioneers at Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology to use PET brain scans targeted against amyloid beta as a tool for detecting Alzheimer’s.

In the current study, also co-authored by Morris and Benzinger, researchers documented the same relationship between neuronal loss and Alzheimer’s symptoms using the non-invasive qGRE MRI technique in living patients.

Working with co-author Richard Perrin, MD, PhD, an associate professor of pathology & immunology, the research team also confirmed this relationship under the microscope by examining brain tissues that were donated after the death of a study participant. The postmortem examination showed that the neuronal loss in the hippocampus actually exceeds loss of tissue volume and that these changes are well reflected in MRI measures of dark matter.

Yablonskiy and colleagues are among the many researchers now pursuing a low-cost, easily accessible test for Alzheimer’s as an alternative to the expensive PET brain scans and invasive spinal taps now used in research settings to assess the presence and progression of the disease.

Such a test, especially one that can identify people at very early stages of disease, would provide a huge boost to Alzheimer’s research, drastically slashing the cost and the time necessary to screen patients for clinical trials, thus spurring the development of new treatments.

While Alzheimer’s researchers continue to pursue drug treatments for the disease, most agree that successful treatment will hinge on early detection and on finding ways to head off brain damage before later stages of Alzheimer’s.

While PET scans and spinal taps continue to play important roles in Alzheimer’s research, both have limitations that prevent their widespread use as a screening tool for early signs of the disease.

PET brain scans are still the gold standard for detecting signs of Alzheimer’s, but the machines are expensive and seldom available for routine patient diagnosis, much less widespread clinical screening. PET scans also require the injection of a radioactive tracer for brain imaging.

As Alzheimer’s progresses, it can be detected by testing for tau proteins in cerebrospinal fluid, but sampling requires a spinal tap that may be too invasive for use as a general screening tool, especially for people who have no symptoms.

Another promising option for Alzheimer’s screening – also under development at Washington University – is a non-invasive, relatively inexpensive blood test that has proven to be highly accurate in detecting early signs of Alzheimer’s disease. A commercial version of the blood test recently became available to doctors in the United States and Europe, but it is not yet covered by health insurance.

While each testing approach has its own strengths and weaknesses, the qGRE MRI technique may be poised for early adoption since it is based on MRI technology that is widely available worldwide, is noninvasive and can be carried out without the use of radioactive tracers.

“Our qGRE test offers great potential as an early diagnostic tool for the preclinical stage of Alzheimer’s disease, thus providing a large window for therapeutic intervention,” Yablonskiy said. “It also has great potential as a noninvasive MRI technique available in a conventional clinical setting for the widespread screening that is necessary to get people with early Alzheimer’s into clinical drug trials.”","New research from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis shows that this novel MRI approach can identify brain cell damage in people at early stages of Alzheimer’s, before tissue shrinkage is visible on traditional MRI scans.

“How many people actually have this disease?”



It’s a potentially triggering question at a family BBQ. I had just finished explaining why I’d recently travelled to the US to work on samples from patients with a rare disease called Proteasome Related Autoinflammatory Syndrome (PRAAS). None of my family had ever heard of this disease, which isn’t surprising. There are less than one thousand patients diagnosed with PRAAS worldwide. So, why work on it?

Research into rare diseases is worthwhile not just because of the people it helps, but because of what it can tell us about more common diseases. Picture: Getty Images

Why not instead work on a neurodegenerative disease like Parkinson’s for which there are over 2,225 newly diagnosed cases every year in Australia alone? Or perhaps a chronic viral infection? In 2019 over 150,000 people in Australia were living with a chronic hepatitis B infection.

It is a good point and arguments can be made for prioritising investment where the most good can be done. But clearly, neither can we abandon the people and families suffering from rare diseases.

It is encouraging then that in 2020 Australia launched its National Strategic Action Plan for Rare Diseases, which involves dedicating to rare diseases some funds from the Medical Research Future Fund and the National Health and Medical Research Council.

But also, it needs to be remembered that research on rare diseases contributes significant new knowledge and understanding not just for the potential benefit of the patients affected, but also for our fundamental understanding of how the body works and fights diseases generally.

Take for example, PRAAS. The clinical presentation of PRAAS involves repetitive fever, severe rashes, immobility in the joints, muscle wastage and delayed physical development. Until 2018 the prognosis for PRAAS was dire. While immunosuppressive drugs could alleviate some symptoms patients ultimately succumbed to respiratory or cardiac failure. But, in 2018 a new treatment was designed which stopped the spread of inflammation and patient outcomes have improved.

Like most rare diseases it’s caused by inborn genetic errors – in PRAAS these errors affect a cell component called the proteasome. Proteasomes are complexes in our cells that identify and destroy unwanted proteins that can otherwise build up and eventually kill the cell.

Computer Illustration of proteasome (right) destroying tumour proteins (left) that have been tagged for destruction by regulatory proteins (yellow). Picture: Getty Images

The problem in PRAAS patients is that genetic errors occur in the creation of proteasome complexes meaning the proteasome isn’t correctly assembled and cannot function.

As a result, dangerous levels of protein ‘trash’ accumulates in the cells of these patients. Interestingly, this induces an inflammatory response from the cell which looks akin to the inflammatory response cells have to a viral infection.

Now, this is very interesting, because in diseases like Parkinson’s it has long been observed that unwanted proteins accumulate in the cells of patients and it is becoming increasingly understood that inflammation contributes to Parkinson’s disease. Furthermore, viruses like hepatitis B have evolved mechanisms to obstruct our cell’s proteasome so that they can replicate inside us.

These observations and many others demonstrate that the accumulation of unwanted proteins can trigger an inflammatory response from a cell, however, the specific molecular mechanism of how this happens wasn’t known, until we looked at PRAAS.

Studying how the loss of function in the proteasome drives inflammation in something like Parkinson’s or chronic viral infection is incredibly difficult because the cause and action of these diseases are complex, involving genetic and environmental factors.

In contrast, PRAAS has a defined genetic mutation that results in the specific loss of proteasome function, and this directly leads to inflammation. These are dots we can connect.

Super resolution microscopy images of a healthy cell (left) and a cell genetically edited to model PRAAS (right) with the nucleus in blue. In the healthy cell there is only a small amount of IL-24 (red) inside the cell, but in the PRAAS cell, IL-24 is accumulating in the cell, and this leads to inflammatory disease in PRAAS. Picture: Supplied

By using PRAAS as a system to study how our cells sense the build-up of protein trash, our research team found that a pattern-recognition receptor called Protein Kinase R (PKR) recognises the accumulation of a certain unwanted protein called IL-24.

Now IL-24 normally functions outside the cell so it can only accumulate inside the cell when the proteasome is not there to clear it away. If IL-24 isn’t cleared away by the proteasome, it is sensed by PKR which then triggers an inflammatory response.

Intriguingly, PKR is different from many other pattern recognition receptors. Along with driving inflammation it also activates a secondary pathway to inhibit the generation of new proteins by the cell. When a cell is stressed, generating new proteins can increase the accumulation of protein trash.

The action of PKR is therefore twofold – it drives inflammation to alert cells in the surrounding environment to a possible infection and it also attempts to reduce the burden of protein trash on the proteasome, hopefully restoring the cell to normal.

Inflammation is important for clearing viral infections, so activation of this pathway can protect cells from infection. However, when a cell cannot return to normal due to inborn genetic errors in a disease like PRAAS, PKR activation can lead to chronic inflammatory disease.

By studying PRAAS we were able to find a previously unknown link between inflammation and the build-up of unwanted proteins. This identified PKR as a potential target for new therapeutics aimed at inhibiting chronic inflammation in PRAAS.

Although it was discovered in a rare disease, this pathway may have implications in neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson’s where protein build-up, inflammation and activation of PKR have all been observed but not yet functionally associated.

Furthermore, it may have implications for combating viral infections since it is possible that this particular inflammatory pathway evolved to combat viral infection.

Understanding this pathway and gaining these insights was only possible because PRAAS has a known genetic cause.

In Australia, a disease is considered rare if it affects less than five in 10,000 people. Although the term ‘rare’ suggests not many people are affected with a condition, there are over 7,000 rare diseases and this means collectively, around 8 per cent of Australians, or two million people, live with a rare disease.

Sadly, diseases like PRAAS are life-threatening or chronically debilitating, and as they are generally caused by inborn genetic errors, the majority of patients are children.

These two million Australians living with a rare chronic disease are actually helping us to further our understanding of human physiology and accelerate the development of treatments for thousands of diseases and conditions both common and rare. Their diseases deserve to be studied.

Dr Mahathir, 97, claimed that he had tried to improve the state of the Malays in the country when he became prime minister for the second time following the 14th General Elections in May 2018.

However, Dr Mahathir said that the then-Pakatan Harapan (PH) government was overthrown and he lost his position as prime minister.

This was after the “Sheraton Move” - a political manoeuvre that saw Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (Bersatu) leave PH in Feb 2020 - caused the coalition to be ousted from the federal government.

“That's why I'm complaining now,” Dr Mahathir said in the post to refute allegations made by current Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.

Without mentioning any names, Mr Anwar at the political event alluded that a former leader - in his two stints as prime minister for “22 years and (another) 22 months” - had used his position to enrich himself, his family and his children.

Dr Mahathir was Malaysia’s prime minister from July 1981 to Oct 2003 and again from May 2018 to Feb 2020.

81,81,https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/levelling-up-lungs/129812/,‘Levelling up’ doomed to fail unless government gives our lungs a boost,"Sarah Woolnough, CEO of Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation, says the government should not miss this vital opportunity to protect our health once and for all

The past two years have shown us how devastating the consequences can be when things go wrong with our lungs. As CEO of the UK’s leading lung charity, every day I hear from people with lung conditions about the challenges they face and how these impact their life, health, job, relationships and wellbeing.

People shouldn’t have to fight for breath – we must do more to protect those living with lung conditions and prevent others from developing these diseases in the future, and now is the time to do that.

The government’s plans to ‘level up’ the country present a vital opportunity

The government recently released its long-awaited levelling up white paper, which sets ambitions to improve the health and living standards for everyone in the UK by 2030. However, for the government to achieve meaningful change it needs to seize this opportunity and put respiratory health at the top of its agenda. For decades lung disease has been side-lined and under-resourced despite the fact that it’s the third biggest killer in the UK.

Even before the COVID-19 pandemic it cost us a staggering £11 billion every year, with £10 billion falling directly on the NHS and patients.

It is a key driver of health inequality and the stark difference in life expectancy across the UK. People living in the poorest neighbourhoods are seven times more likely to die of a respiratory condition than those in the richest areas. This is partly because they are more likely to live in areas more polluted by toxic air, and in damp, poor quality housing that can trigger and worsen lung conditions. We cannot address lung disease without tackling these inequalities. Coupled with this, our failure to properly invest in respiratory research has held us back from being able to properly support the 1 in 5 people who live with a lung disease across the UK.

If its levelling up agenda is to have any chance of success, the government must specifically acknowledge the long-term impact of lung disease as a key driver of health and social inequalities, that can only be addressed if every part of government is mobilised to prevent, tackle and care for those living with lung conditions.

A joined-up approach is needed

The response to COVID-19, including record-breaking vaccine development and the speed with which our fabulous NHS has managed to roll it out, has shown that tackling respiratory illnesses is most effective when the vision and the lead comes from the heart of government, with clear and effective decision-making towards specific targets taking place at the national, regional and local levels. The same approach is needed to cut deaths and hospitalisations from lung disease. Tackling toxic air is a good place to start.

Air pollution is a leading cause of new lung conditions and responsible for 36,000 premature deaths every year – we’ll only see this number kerbed if we are able to redesign our heavily populated towns and cities to reduce the number of vehicles on the road. We’ve seen some incredible results from Clean Air Zones across cities like Birmingham, and in London the Ultra-Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) has recently been expanded to have a bigger impact on London’s toxic air. These schemes are effective because they remove polluting cars from our roads, are backed by extra support to help people switch to electric vehicles and public transport, and encourage walking and cycling which actively promote good mental and physical health.

Some of the largest health benefits to be had from tackling air pollution will be found in some of our poorest communities. 85% of people living in areas with illegal levels of air pollution make up the poorest 20% of the UK population, meaning that the health improvements that come from tackling toxic air will have a disproportionately positive effect on some of the poorest places in the country.

By ensuring all departments are involved in levelling up lung health, the government can make sure it hits its target to reduce the gap in healthy life expectancy by 2030, protect the environment and deliver greater economic productivity to some of the most deprived places in the UK.

Levelling up provides a key opportunity to improve the shocking health gap

Our recent report found that more than three quarters of people living with the deadly lung disease COPD did not receive fundamental, basic care, and that there could be well over one million people across the country living with undiagnosed COPD.

The 100 new Community Diagnostic Centres, due to open by 2025, will help to support people with a lung condition get diagnosed and manage their illness. However, in order to achieve the missions set out in the white paper and provide maximum ongoing support in every community, we need more of these centres rolled out right across the country, ideally three centres per million of the population by 2030.

Huntington’s disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder where a person who has the causative gene experiences gradually worsening problems with movement, thinking and behavior, with symptoms first showing usually in mid-life. This is caused by the production of a mutant protein which leads to the loss of specific cells in the brain. Although we know which gene causes HD and understand a lot about why it happens, there is still no treatment available that can slow down the course of the disease or cure it altogether.

HD affects about 1 person in 10,000 in the UK, which classifies it as a rare disease. This makes conducting research into new treatments that much more challenging because we still need large numbers of people to become involved in research to demonstrate that new treatments are effective. Having said that, the global HD community is incredibly research active, with people living with HD volunteering their time and their bodies to furthering HD research in the hope of one day finding something that may help slow or stop this devastating disease.

For instance, many people with HD are taking part in the Enroll-HD study. This is a large global study where participants undergo an annual assessment of their symptoms. HD researchers can then apply to use that data in an effort to understand how HD develops and affects people over the longer term, which is incredibly important for a rare disease like HD. Another huge benefit of Enroll-HD is that it also acts as a registry of research-interested people and can be used to aid recruitment to clinical studies. Recruitment is a real problem for all clinical research but is especially difficult for rare diseases.

Whilst Enroll-HD provides a really valuable platform for conducting research studies in HD, we still face the problem of small numbers of people being asked to undergo many study visits and testing to collect the information needed. We need to find ways of reducing the burden on those who volunteer to take part so that the community is not overwhelmed with research.

We need to find ways of reducing the burden on those who volunteer to take part so that the community is not overwhelmed with research.

Clinical research in HD has seemingly entered a new era, with emerging potential new therapies moving away from the more traditional ‘pill-once-a-day’ approach to treatments that need to be delivered directly to the central nervous system. Currently, there are a number of studies investigating the potential of a number of treatments like this in clinical trials, but the availability of disease-modifying treatments in the clinic is still some way off from becoming a reality.

Whilst work continues to identify and test new drug treatments for HD, it is important to continue investigating other ways that the disease course may be altered and for ways to improve the quality of life of people living with HD. Previous research has shown that point at which symptoms start to become apparent and how quickly the symptoms worsen can be influenced by things other than the disease-causing mutation alone. These factors include other genes (known as genetic modifiers), physical activity and a person’s environment.

Our group have conducted a number of studies looking at how physical activity interventions may benefit people with HD. Given the potential of other lifestyle factors to influence the progression of HD, we wanted to extend this work to see if a holistic lifestyle intervention might provide benefit and improve the quality of life of people with HD. However, there are lots of things we do not know about the general lifestyle of people with HD which we need to understand first, and this is the subject of the DOMINO-HD study (Multi-Domain Lifestyle Targets for Improving ProgNOsis in Huntington’s Disease).

DOMINO-HD

DOMINO-HD is a project funded by the Joint Program for Neurodegenerative Disease and is a consortium effort, led by Monica Busse in Cardiff, with contributions from partners in Ireland, Spain, Germany, Switzerland, Poland, RAND corporation and the European Huntington’s Association. Within this project we want to measure how a person’s lifestyle and pre-determined genetic profile can combine to affect the way in which HD progresses. At the same time as doing this, we are investigating ways of measuring these aspects of lifestyle using commercially available digital devices in an effort to maximize data collection whilst simultaneously reducing the burden on our participants.

To look at how lifestyle and genetic factors affect how quickly HD might progress we are asking people to take part in a 12-month observational study. At the beginning of the study, participants from the UK, Spain, Germany, Switzerland and Poland will be asked to complete some questionnaires on physical activity, diet, sleep and quality of life. We will link these visits to recent Enroll-HD study visits so that we can use the clinical data collected as part of Enroll and reduce the amount participants have to do at each study visit. The participants will then be given a Fitbit to wear for the remainder of the study so that we can measure physical activity and sleep over the 12 months. We will then combine the data with clinical measures obtained from Enroll-HD at 12 months to investigate how lifestyle factors may influence the progression of HD.

It is really important to highlight that commercially available devices like Fitbit have been developed for use by ‘average’ people. We do not know if the devices will record sleep and physical activity in people with a movement disorder with the same degree of reliability as those it was designed for. Therefore, we are also running a number of sub-studies across all the consortium partners to investigate this further. The sub-studies include a closer examination of using Fitbit to record sleep, physical activity and energy expenditure (i.e. calorie burn) as well as a deeper exploration into the role of nutrition and diet.

Once all the data has been collected and analyzed, we want to use it to develop a lifestyle intervention, which would include advice and guidance on physical activity, sleep and nutrition which we could then test to see if it helps improve quality of life in HD. We also hope to understand more about how digital technologies can be employed in longer-term research to reduce the burden on those volunteering to take part. This can then be applied to long-term research in other conditions and rare diseases to maximize research efficiency and potential.","© picture-waterfall / stock.adobe.comHuntington’s disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder where a person who has the causative gene experiences gradually worsening problems with movement, thinking and behavior, with symptoms first showing usually in mid-life.

The survey asked clinicians to answer questions about their recent interactions with program participants who live with cardiometabolic conditions including cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, and obesity.

When asked to rank the top concerns discussed during virtual care visits, the clinicians cited health goal management—such as lowering A1c, blood pressure, and weight—as a top concern expressed by their patients (53%, with 24% reporting it as the number one concern among their patients). This demonstrates an increase from a similar survey done in 2021 which resulted in 40% citing health goal management as a top concern, with only 12% citing it as the number one concern among their patients.

“In 2021, our clinicians saw discussions around mental health issues like depression and anxiety take priority over discussions about disease management itself. However, as we begin to emerge from the pandemic, more patients are now making disease management a high priority in their lives,” said Mark Clermont, chief executive officer at Cecelia Health. “The clinician-led support that our multidisciplinary team delivers, especially in those critical moments between doctor visits, allows individuals to be better equipped to navigate cardiometabolic health management in a way that addresses all of their unique needs to meet health goals.”

As a follow-up to a 2021 study that found mental health was a bigger concern for people living with diabetes than diabetes itself, this survey was expanded to include clinicians who support several chronic disease management programs. Questions were fielded in Q4 2022, and 111 clinicians—including Certified Diabetes Care and Education Specialists, Registered Dietitians, and Registered Nurses—shared responses. Approximately 10% of the clinicians surveyed support programs in a language other than English.

Financial concerns remain a substantial topic, with 77% of clinicians discussing it in sessions with patients over the past year (up from 69% in 2021). However, fewer clinicians (37%) reported it as the number one issue they expect to discuss in the next six months (down from 51% in 2021). Other findings from the survey include:



80% of clinician respondents reported discussing depression, anxiety, or other mental health concerns with patients during sessions in the last year (up 3 percentage points from 77% in 2021).

84% of clinicians surveyed discussed diabetes itself (up 13 percentage points from 71% in 2021).

77% of clinician respondents reported discussing obesity (up 12 percentage points from 65% in 2021).

25% of clinicians surveyed say the patients they support are more motivated to adhere to their care management plan in the last year (up 8 percentage points from 17% in 2021).

When asked to report on a memorable interaction with a patient, one Cecelia Health clinician, a bilingual Registered Dietitian, responded, “a patient told me she is very grateful that I not only provide health education related to her chronic medical conditions but can also counsel on mental health issues, which is a determinant of overall health.” This demonstrates the value of relationship building for accountability and importance of connection on health management. The clinician added, ""she also values that I check up on her at least once monthly, as no one else does. [This patient] stated the lack of check-ins negatively impacted her health more than her chronic physical conditions.”

Nearly all clinicians surveyed believe telehealth and remote support allow them to build trusting relationships with patients that make a demonstrable difference in their everyday lives. More than three-quarters of clinicians (78%) believe the use of telehealth will continue to grow as a resource for chronic condition management throughout 2023. While the use of telehealth services and remote care quickly became a norm due to the pandemic, its positive impacts suggest this type of care is here to stay and will continue to evolve. For example, Cecelia Health is expanding the use case for telehealth beyond the typical primary care setting through virtual specialty care. Patients, as appropriate, are connected to specialists—including endocrinologists, cardiologists, and nephrologists—which increases access to care, delivers a better patient experience and, ultimately, leads to better health outcomes.

Bateman, MD, the Charles F. and Joanne Knight Distinguished Professor of Neurology, inspects a mass spectrometry machine at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. Using mass spectrometry, Bateman and colleagues have developed a blood test that is up to 93% accurate at identifying people at risk of Alzheimer's dementia.

A blood test developed at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis has proven highly accurate in detecting early signs of Alzheimer’s disease in a study involving nearly 500 patients from across three continents, providing further evidence that the test should be considered for routine screening and diagnosis.

The study is available in the journal Neurology.

“Our study shows that the blood test provides a robust measure for detecting amyloid plaques associated with Alzheimer’s disease, even among patients not yet experiencing cognitive declines,” said senior author Randall J. Bateman, MD, the Charles F. and Joanne Knight Distinguished Professor of Neurology.

“A blood test for Alzheimer’s provides a huge boost for Alzheimer’s research and diagnosis, drastically cutting the time and cost of identifying patients for clinical trials and spurring the development of new treatment options,” Bateman said. “As new drugs become available, a blood test could determine who might benefit from treatment, including those at very early stages of the disease.”

Developed by Bateman and colleagues, the blood test assesses whether amyloid plaques have begun accumulating in the brain based on the ratio of the levels of the amyloid beta proteins Aβ42 and Aβ40 in the blood.

Researchers have long pursued a low-cost, easily accessible blood test for Alzheimer’s as an alternative to the expensive brain scans and invasive spinal taps now used to assess the presence and progression of the disease within the brain.

Evaluating the disease using PET brain scans – still the gold standard – requires a radioactive brain scan, at an average cost of $5,000 to $8,000 per scan. Another common test, which analyzes levels of amyloid-beta and tau protein in cerebrospinal fluid, costs about $1,000 but requires a spinal tap process that some patients may be unwilling to endure.

This study estimates that prescreening with a $500 blood test could reduce by half both the cost and the time it takes to enroll patients in clinical trials that use PET scans. Screening with blood tests alone could be completed in less than six months and cut costs by tenfold or more, the study finds.

A commercial test based on Bateman’s research was certified in 2020 under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) program. The CLIA certification program is run by the Food and Drug Administration in partnership with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

Known as Precivity AD, the commercial version of the test is marketed by C2N Diagnostics, a Washington University startup founded by Bateman and his colleague David Holtzman, MD, the Barbara Burton and Reuben M. Morriss III Distinguished Professor of Neurology. Bateman and Holtzman are inventors on a patent the university licensed to C2N.

CLIA certification makes the test available for doctors in the United States. It is intended to provide information that will aid the medical evaluation and care of patients who already have symptoms of cognitive decline. A similar certification makes the test available in Europe. The test is not yet covered by most health insurance.

The current study shows that the blood test remains highly accurate, even when performed in different labs following different protocols, and in different cohorts across three continents.

Scientists didn’t know if small differences in sampling methods, such as whether blood is collected after fasting or the type of anti-coagulant used in blood processing, could have a big impact on test accuracy because results are based on subtle shifts in amyloid beta protein levels in the blood. Differences that interfere with the precise measurement of these amyloid protein ratios could have triggered a false negative or positive result.

To confirm the test’s accuracy, researchers applied it to blood samples from individuals enrolled in ongoing Alzheimer’s studies in the United States, Australia and Sweden, each of which uses different protocols for the processing of blood samples and related brain imaging.

Findings from this study confirmed that the Aβ42/Aβ40 blood test using a high-precision immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry technique developed at Washington University provides highly accurate and consistent results for both cognitively impaired and unimpaired individuals across all three studies.

When blood amyloid levels were combined with another major Alzheimer’s risk factor – the presence of the genetic variant APOE4 – the accuracy of the blood test was 88% when compared to brain imaging and 93% when compared to spinal tap.

“These results suggest the test can be useful in identifying nonimpaired patients who may be at risk for future dementia, offering them the opportunity to get enrolled in clinical trials when early intervention has the potential to do the most good,” Bateman said. “A negative test result also could help doctors rule out Alzheimer’s in patients whose impairments may be related to some other health issue, disease or medication.”","Using mass spectrometry, Bateman and colleagues have developed a blood test that is up to 93% accurate at identifying people at risk of Alzheimer's dementia.

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) today announced that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has approved the company’s 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV20), which will be marketed in the European Union (EU) under the brand name APEXXNAR. The vaccine is approved for active immunization for the prevention of invasive disease and pneumonia caused by Streptococcuspneumoniae in individuals 18 years of age and older.

“The EMA’s authorization of APEXXNAR for adults continues Pfizer’s ongoing commitment to help prevent certain potentially-serious infectious respiratory diseases, including invasive pneumococcal disease and pneumonia,” said Nanette Cocero, Ph.D., Global President of Pfizer Vaccines. “APEXXNAR helps protect against the 20 serotypes in the vaccine, and today’s approval offers adults -- through a single dose -- the broadest serotype protection of any available pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in Europe.”

Today’s authorization follows the recent positive opinion from the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) announced on December 17, 2021. The authorization is valid in all 27 EU member states plus Iceland, Lichtenstein, and Norway. The EMA had previously accepted review of Pfizer’s Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for the 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine candidate in February 2021.

The EMA authorization for APEXXNAR is based on evidence from a clinical program in adults, including Phase 1 and 2 trials, and three Phase 3 trials (NCT03760146, NCT03828617, and NCT03835975) describing the safety and evaluating the immunogenicity of the vaccine. More than 6,000 adult subjects 18 years and older participated in the three Phase 3 trials, including adults 65 years of age and older. The populations included adults with stable chronic medical conditions, pneumococcal vaccine-naïve adults, and adults with a history of prior pneumococcal vaccination.

About PCV20

PCV20 – known as APEXXNAR in the EU and PREVNAR 20TM in the US -- is Pfizer’s next-generation pneumococcal conjugate vaccine that includes capsular polysaccharide conjugates for the 13 serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F and 23F) already included in PREVENAR 13® (Pneumococcal 13-valent Conjugate Vaccine [Diphtheria CRM 197 Protein]), known as PREVNAR 13® in the U.S. The vaccine also contains capsular polysaccharide conjugates for seven additional serotypes (8, 10A, 11A, 12F, 15B, 22F and 33F) that cause invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD),1,2,3,4,5 and have been associated with high case-fatality rates,6,7,8,9 antibiotic resistance,10,11,12 and/or meningitis.13,14 APEXXNAR contains the broadest serotype coverage of any available conjugate vaccine and helps protect against the 20 Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes in the vaccine.

On June 8, 2021, Pfizer announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved PREVNAR 20, which is the U.S trade name for PCV20, for the prevention of invasive disease and pneumonia in adults age 18 years or older. Pfizer has recently submitted to the FDA a supplemental Biologics License Application to include data in the PREVNAR 20 prescribing information for adults age 18 years or older regarding coadministration of PREVNAR 20 with a seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine.

Pivotal Phase 3 studies of the 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine candidate in infants are expected to read out in the second half of 2022 and, if positive, form the basis of potential regulatory submissions to the FDA and EMA later this year.

It is aimed at raising awareness of the importance of the kidneys.Kidneys play a pivotal role in the body. They not only purify the blood of various metabolic waste, but also it helps in regulating blood pressure, maintaining health of the bones, normal haemoglobin (essential for transferring oxygen in the blood from lungs to the tissues), among others.The common symptoms of kidney disease include fatigue and tiredness, high blood pressure, swelling on feet, puffiness of face, urinary abnormalities, among others.""Kidney disease may be silent in many patients in the initial stages and be manifested when the disease becomes advanced.

Gupta, Director & HOD, Nephrology, Paras Hospitals, Gurugram.Chronic kidney disease (CKD) - a progressive kidney failure over months to years - is majorly caused by diabetes and hypertension. Individuals with a long standing history of diabetes, hypertension, frequent usage of painkillers and family history of kidney disease are more prone to developing CKD, and these must be ""screened regularly"".People at risk should monitor their kidney functions by doing blood and urine tests once in 6 to 12 months, Gupta said.According to Dr Parth Rana, director of Netralaya Hospital, Ahmedabad, ""Approximately 50 per cent patients who have diabetic retinopathy (DR is diabetes complication that affects eyes) suffer from chronic kidney diseases (CKD)"".In India, over 62 per cent CKD diseases are due to diabetes and diabetic retinopathy affects 18 per cent diabetic population in urban India.""The prevalence of CKD and DR increases proportionally to the disease duration in Type 2 Diabetes. Additionally, as CKD and DR share common risk factors such as smoking, poor glycemic control, systolic hypertension, or dyslipidemia, development of DR may predict development and progression of CKD,"" Rana told IANS.The common thread between CKD and Diabetic retinopathy is the damage caused by high sugar levels to small blood vessels in the body, he explained.Patients with CKD are also at a higher risk of age-related ocular diseases. Age-related ocular diseases such as cataract, retinopathy, glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration, are leading causes of blindness in middle aged and elderly adults.Further, Covid also contributed to an increase in kidney problems among patients already suffering.

94,94,https://www.eco-business.com/news/eradicating-extreme-poverty-would-raise-global-emissions-by-less-than-1-2/,Eradicating ‘extreme poverty’ would raise global emissions by less than 1%,"The study, published in Nature Sustainability, highlights the global inequality in emissions between people in rich and poor countries. For example, it finds that the average carbon footprint of a person living in sub-Saharan Africa is 0.6 tonnes of carbon dioxide (tCO2). Meanwhile, the average US citizen produces 14.5tCO2 per year.

The authors find that the average carbon footprint in the top 1 per cent of emitters was more than 75-times higher than that in the bottom 50 per cent.

“The inequality is just insane,” the lead author of the study tells Carbon Brief. “If we want to reduce our carbon emissions, we really need to do something about the consumption patterns of the super-rich.”

A scientist not involved in the research says that “we often hear that actions taken in Europe or the US are meaningless when compared to the industrial emissions of China, or the effects of rapid population growth in Africa. This paper exposes these claims as wilfully ignorant, at best”.

Emissions inequality

Humans release tens of billions of tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere every year. However, the distribution of these emissions is unequal – as they are disproportionately produced by people in wealthier countries who typically live more carbon-intensive lifestyles.

The new study uses what it calls “outstandingly detailed” global expenditure data from the World Bank Consumption Dataset from 2014 to assess the carbon footprints of people in different countries, and with different consumption levels.

Dr Klaus Hubacek is a professor of science, technology and society at the University of Groningen and an author on the study. He tells Carbon Brief what is included in consumption figures:

“Driving the model with the consumption patterns calculates the carbon emissions not only directly through expenditure for heating and cooling, but the embodied carbon emissions in the products they buy. So it’s taking account of the entire global supply chains to calculate those carbon emissions.”

Dr Yuli Shan – a faculty research fellow in climate change economics at the University of Groningen – is also an author on the study. He explains that using consumption data ensures that carbon emissions are linked to the countries that use goods and services, rather than the countries that produce them. This is important, because “poor countries emit large quantities of CO2 due to the behaviour of people in developed countries”, he adds.

The map below shows the average carbon footprints of residents of the 116 countries included in the study. The shading indicates the size of the carbon footprint, for low (blue) to high (red). Note the exponential scale on the colour bar.

The authors find that Luxembourg has the highest average national per capita carbon footprint in the study, at 30tCO2 per person, followed by the US with 14.5tCO2. It is worth noting that a number of countries with high per-capita emissions are not included in the study, such as Australia, Canada, Japan, Saudi Arabia and Iran, as these are not included in the dataset.

In contrast, Madagascar, Malawi, Burkina Faso, Uganda, Ethiopia and Rwanda all have average carbon footprints of less than 0.2tCO2.

Dr Shoibal Chakravarty is a visiting professor at the Divecha Centre for Climate Change and was also not involved in the research. He tells Carbon Brief that the study “significantly improves on previous attempts” to measure per-capita emissions, and is “more rigorous that past efforts”.

The rich and the ‘super-rich’

Within each country, the authors also split the population into groups based on how much they spend, on average. Benedikt Bruckner – the lead author on the study, also from the University of Groningen – tells Carbon Brief that while previous studies typically used four or five groups, this study uses more than 200.

The high number of “expenditure bins” allows for “more precise, more detailed [and] more accurate” analysis, Hubacek says.

When including bins, the spread of carbon footprints ranges from less than 0.01 tCO2 for more than a million people in sub-Saharan countries to hundreds of tonnes of CO2 for about 500,000 individuals at the top of the “global expenditure spectrum”, the authors find.

The authors then split the global population into the top 1 per cent, next 9 per cent, next 40 per cent and bottom 50 per cent of emitters. Their share of global emissions (left) and average carbon footprint (right) are shown in red, yellow, light blue and dark blue below, respectively.

The study finds that the average carbon footprint in the top 1 per cent of emitters is more than 75-times higher than that in the bottom 50 per cent.

This gap is “astonishing”, Dr Wiliam Lamb – a researcher at the Mercator Research Institute who was not involved in the study – tells Carbon Brief. He adds that responsibility for global emissions lies with the “super-rich”:

“In the public conversation on climate change, we often hear that actions taken in Europe or the US are meaningless when compared to the industrial emissions of China, or the effects of rapid population growth in Africa. This paper exposes these claims as wilfully ignorant, at best. By far the worst polluters are the super-rich, most of whom live in high income countries.”

Lamb notes that the expenditure of the “super-rich” may be even higher than suggested by this analysis, because “their earnings may be derived from investments, while their expenditures can be shrouded in secrecy.”

Dr Bruckner also highlights this underestimation, noting that while the highest carbon footprints in this study go up to hundreds of tonnes of CO2 per year, past studies into the super-rich have produced carbon footprint estimates of more than 1,000 tonnes per year. “The inequality is just insane,” he tells Carbon Brief. He adds:

“If we want to reduce our carbon emissions, we really need to do something about the consumption patterns of the super-rich.”

Eradicating poverty

In 2015, the United Nations set a series of Sustainable Development Goals – the first of which is to “end poverty in all its forms everywhere”. The goal focuses on eradicating “extreme poverty” – defined as living on less than US$1.90 per day – as well as halving poverty as defined by national poverty lines.

The map below shows the proportion of people in the 119 countries mapped are living in extreme poverty, from a low level (blue) to high (red).

More than a billion people were living below the extreme poverty line of US$1.90 per day in 2014, according to the study. The authors find that “extreme poverty” is mostly concentrated in Africa and south Asia – where per capita CO2 emissions are generally the lowest.

“Carbon inequality is a mirror to extreme income and wealth inequality experienced at a national and global level today,” the study says.

To investigate how poverty alleviation would impact global carbon emissions, the authors devised a range of possible “poverty alleviation and eradication scenarios”.

These scenarios assume no changes in population or energy balance. Instead, they shift people living in poverty into an expenditure group above the poverty line – and assume that their consumption patterns and carbon footprints change accordingly given present-day consumption habits in their country.

The authors find that eradicating “extreme poverty” – by raising everyone above the US$1.90 per day threshold – would drive up global carbon emissions by less than 1 per cent.

Countries in Africa and south Asia would see the greatest increase in emissions, the authors find. For example, they find that emissions in low and lower-middle income countries in sub-Saharan Africa – such as Madagascar – would double if everyone were lifted out of extreme poverty.

Meanwhile, the study finds that lifting 3.6 billion people over the poverty line of US$5.50 per day would drive an 18 per cent increase in global emissions.

The study shows that “eradicating extreme poverty is not a concern for climate mitigation”, says Dr Narasimha Rao – an associate professor of energy systems at the Yale School of Environment, who was not involved in the study.

Warming targets

To meet the targets outlined in the Paris Agreement – of limiting global warming to 1.5C or “well below” 2C above pre-industrial levels – humanity has a limited “carbon budget” left to emit.

The study investigates how the average carbon footprints of different countries line up with the Paris warming targets.

The graphic below shows average carbon footprints in a range of countries and regions, including the US, Middle East, North Africa and Turkey (MENAT) and sub-Saharan Africa. The colour of each column indicates the region’s average expenditure per person, measured using “purchasing power parity” to account for the different costs of living between different countries.

The dotted lines show the target per-capita footprint that the world would need to adopt to limit warming to 2C (top line) and 1.5C (bottom line).

The authors find that according to existing literature, humanity needs to reach an average carbon footprint of 1.6-2.8tCO2 in the coming decade to limit warming to 1.5C or 2C above preindustrial levels.

In this chart, the US exceeds this amount the most dramatically. Meanwhile, individuals in sub-Saharan Africa are well below the global target range – emitting only 0.6tCO2 per year on average.

“From a climate justice perspective, the clear focus of climate policy should be on high emitters,” Lamb tells Carbon Brief. He adds:

“We have a moral imperative to reduce emissions as fast as possible in order to avoid climate impacts where they will land the worst – in the Global South – as well as to ease the burden of the transition on vulnerable populations.”

Dr Shonali Pachauri is a researcher at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, and was not involved in the study. She tells Carbon Brief that this analysis “shin[es] a light on the level of inequality in carbon emissions evident across the world today”. She adds:

“[The analysis] is critical to setting equitable and just targets for climate mitigation, such that those who contribute the most to current emissions mitigate the most in alignment with the UNFCCC’s common but differentiated responsibility and polluter pays principle.”

His fishing boat was sunk and destroyed during the tsunami, leaving him unable to make a living.

However, he is also worried about how the crisis is affecting his community. “My village’s main source of income and livelihood come from the ocean, but the waves damaged the majority of our boats” he says.

“We sold seafood daily, but now there’s none. Anyone whose boat was not destroyed no long goes fishing, due to toxicity warnings”, he adds, referring to fears associated with the ash fall that blanketed Tonga’s islands following the volcanic eruption.

UN Tonga/Sia Angilau Fangupō Lātū at his Pātangata home.

Food supply concerns

Recovery and food security are the main medium and long-term challenges facing Tonga. As clean-up efforts continue, schools will reopen in Tonga but, when they do, many families will not be able to afford to pay required fees.

Given these specific needs, the United Nations teams on the ground in Tonga and Fiji are working with the Tongan Government, Ministry of Fisheries, and National Emergency Management Office (NEMO) to ensure the needs of people like Mr. Lātū are met.

The UN’s World Food Programme (WFP) and Tonga’s Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Forests, are identifying how and where they can assist, to accurately address Tonga’s additional food requirements, and ensure a coordinated response.

A total of around $354,000 in funding from the Special Fund for Emergency and Rehabilitation Activities (SFERA) has been allocated to Tonga, through the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).

Additionally, and in the immediate aftermath, Tonga’s National Emergency Management Committee approved funding to support a decrease in the cost of deep sea fishing permits to five Tongan pa’anga (the local currency) per kilogram (USD$2.20 per kg), for a month.

Rehabilitating aquaculture

The rehabilitation of farming aquaculture is also underway in Tonga, especially for Mokohonu (sea cucumber) and Kanahe (fish), and the Ministry of Fisheries has implemented their Immediate Response Plan until the end of this month.

This includes ensuring sufficient fish from safe sources (longline tuna and deep-water snapper fisheries) are available to the public, for consumption. The Fisheries Ministry is working closely with FAO to target priority areas for immediate support.

""We are gradually getting a clearer picture of the effects which this disaster has had on the vital fisheries and agricultural sectors on which so many Tongans depend - whether it’s in terms of damage to coral reefs or from the ash cover in parts of the islands,” notes FAO Sub-Regional Coordinator for the Pacific, Ms. Xiangjun Yao.

“Under the One-UN approach, we are gearing up to provide support so that people can get back on their feet as quickly and safely as possible.""

Speaking at the first of three Institute of Policy Studies lectures as an S R Nathan Fellow for the Study of Singapore, Mr Daniel – who is also interim chief executive officer of SPH Media Trust, but said he was speaking in his personal capacity – posed five questions to the audience about the role of the media and the freedoms it has.

Do the laws allow the media to do a good, professional job?

Is there room for a responsible watchdog role?

Should the media play a “nation-building” role?

What about the notion of a “marketplace of ideas”?

What changes are needed to allow for a greater diversity of views?

Outlining various laws that regulate the ownership, management and financing of Singapore’s newspapers and broadcasters, he said: “The Singapore media’s challenge is that it has to do its job within the ambit of all these laws. Now, I would point out that one feature about Singapore is that each law is applied. They’re not there for show, so we have to take them seriously.

“But thankfully, there is no, and never was any, regime of prior vetting of content in the news business. Even SPH management doesn’t do it.”

Mr Daniel touched on the Newspaper and Printing Presses Act and the Broadcasting Act, as well as the more recent Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (Pofma) and Foreign Interference Countermeasures Act (Fica).

“Journalists have to navigate this panoply of laws. There are hundreds of journalists... beavering away every day to produce good-quality, meaningful work, despite the laws,” he said at the hybrid event held at the National University of Singapore.

On whether there is room for a responsible watchdog role, Mr Daniel said he believed there is, but it cannot be the media’s only role.

“Can you imagine if I have a newsroom of journalists who come in every morning and they say: Right, who can I go after today?... Equally, I would say you can’t have journalists coming and saying: Which government policy can I support today?” he said.

“So what we want are editors and journalists who think hard about the stories that our readers want to read, or read more of.”

On whether the media should play a societal or nation-building role, he said Singapore media is not averse to it but it should also not be its sole role.

With regard to the notion of a “marketplace of ideas” – where the best idea wins the market and which argues against censorship and is pro-free flow of ideas, attributed to philosopher John Stuart Mill, Mr Daniel said: “While the marketplace of ideas may not be the best paradigm, there is a growing desire among Singaporeans, both young and old, for a greater diversity of views.”

He said: “The challenge for us is how to take a middle road, and strive for diversity and fairness.”

Mr Daniel said that looking at election results, it would be safe to say 30 per cent to 40 per cent of voters have a different view of many things, and the media has tried to reflect their views, too.

He said: “This part of the media’s job – telling the facts first – is unfortunately not well understood by many of our critics. Because now, it’s a jumble – facts, interpretation, opinion – all thrown into one. It’s called ... ‘adding value’.

“Now, if you do a story and readers like your interpretation or opinions, it’s a good story. If they don’t like your interpretations or the opinions you quote, it’s a bad story. And if you just give the facts, that’s also not good enough. So it’s becoming a very polarised world, even here in Singapore.”","SINGAPORE - There is no untrammelled freedom of expression in Singapore, or in many other societies, and there are laws regulating the media.

The businesswoman and model will change her name from Kardashian-West back to just Kardashian after a motion was granted by a judge at Los Angeles County Superior Court.

The reality star, who appeared by video link at the hearing on Wednesday, made the request for the legal change in December.

The motion to change her marital status has been granted before details of child custody and property are worked out.

This practice, known in court as bifurcation, is common in complicated divorces.

Last month lawyers on behalf of Kardashian said West had agreed to the bifurcation in advance, which the rapper denied in his own legal filings.

Laura Wasser, representing Kardashian, accused West, who has legally changed his name to Ye, of ""strategically"" changing his legal representation to slow down the proceedings.

West's new lawyer, Samantha Spector, admitted on Wednesday that she had been involved in the case for ""less than 24 hours"".

The rapper was previously represented by Chris Melcher.

Despite the dissolution of their legal marital status, there are further conditions regarding retirement plans and asset management that are still to be resolved.

Ifeyinwa Osunkwo, MD:Dr Desai, before we go into acute care and the disease treatment options, can you lay a landscape of how much sickle cell disease there is? How many people are affected globally in the United States? What are we talking about in terms of demographics—how many of them are young, maybe old? What should people anticipate in their practice in terms of the chance of seeing a sickle cell patient as a primary care doctor or as a hematologist?

Payal Desai, MD:In the United States, 1 of 6 African Americans carries the sickle cell trait mutation. You can see that birth rates are different across different parts of the world and across the United States. For example, there are about 8 to 10 states with the majority of sickle cell disease cases in the United States. A lot of them are in the South, in warmer climates. Patients also gravitate to those areas because of their disease. A lot of patients do better in warmer temperatures. It’s also the areas where we’ve had the largest African American population.

In the United States, most patients who have sickle cell disease are African American, and that’s where the largest communities exist. If you look outside the United States, track the equator and you’ll see, whether that’s in South America, the Caribbean, Africa, India, the Mediterranean. We think about sickle cell as a Black disease, but it’s not; it affects all sorts of nationalities. Anywhere the mutation might have protected people from malaria, you can see that. The incidence is much higher outside the United States. In countries such as India and Nigeria, the rates are quite high, and you see birth rates that affect. I’ve seen some statistics that say 1 of 10 people, 1 of 5 people. It’s hard to know without newborn screening, but I’ve seen lots of rates. The annual populations are in the hundreds of thousands, instead of the total population in the United States, which is around 100,000. I would love if other people have input or other statistics that they could speak to.

Ifeyinwa Osunkwo, MD:Wally, what are your thoughts?

Wally R. Smith, MD:I’m interested in India, which until 10 years ago—when the world sickle cell map was epidemiologically validated by [Frédéric] Piel and others—we were unaware of the huge population. Outside the African continent, India has the largest concentration of patients with sickle cell disease. I didn’t learn that growing up. That wasn’t in the textbooks, and their expression is phenotypically different.

Ifeyinwa Osunkwo, MD: Yes.

Wally R. Smith, MD:I’m interested in in trying to understand that what can we learn from Indian patients with sickle cell that might lead to better disease management. What about their hemoglobin is different that would be a target for some drug? I have no idea.

Ifeyinwa Osunkwo, MD: Nimish?

Nirmish Ramesh Shah, MD:I’ll carry that to the next step. The fascinating part is some of the epigenetic things that might be leading to some protection. We see this in the Middle East, we’re learning more about India, but even the simple things that we look at epigenetically, like the upregulation of fetal hemoglobin, seems to be 1 area that in the Middle East and India are higher than what we see in the United States in the Black African American population. They do present very differently. They present later, but inevitably it’s sickle cell disease and; in many times, it’s not asymptomatic. They’re patients whom we must follow and learn from, but I emphasize what Dr Smith’s saying: that we can learn a lot. If the fetal hemoglobin is a specific target, then we need to do more research in trying to figure out how to do a better job of increasing fetal hemoglobin beyond what we’ve been doing with hydroxyurea.

Ifeyinwa Osunkwo, MD: Excellent. Basically, sickle cell is a global disease; it doesn’t affect only Americans. It affects people around the world. For the pop quiz at the end of this session, the top countries for sickle cell disease in order of magnitude are Nigeria, India, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Tanzania. There are about 100,000 people in the United States. Worldwide there are about 300,000 babies born [with sickle cell disease] every year, and the majority in low-income countries will pass away before their fifth birthday. It’s a huge burden. I anticipate that in the next couple of years, every provider—no matter where you are—will have the privilege of seeing sickle cell patients who most likely are adults. As Dr Smith said, 95% of kids in the United States and high-income countries are going to live to age 18. About 60% to 65% are over age 18, so they’re living longer, but we still have a way to go to shorten the mortality gap.

He was responding to Members of Parliament who asked smoking-related questions, including whether Singapore will study and introduce such a ban, following the New Zealand government’s plans to do so.

Under the New Zealand government's plans, people aged 14 and under in 2027 will never be allowed to purchase cigarettes in the country.

The New Zealand government will consult a health task force before introducing legislation in June, with the aim of making it law by the end of this year. Restrictions will then be rolled out in stages from 2024.

Dr Koh said: ""It is an attractive proposal, in that it prevents young people from taking up smoking while not putting too many restrictions on older smokers. Then, of course, as the years go by, more and more cohorts are smoking free.""

While the Ministry of Health (MOH) is open to studying such a policy, he noted that the Government needs to take into account a few considerations.

CHALLENGES IN IMPLEMENTING COHORT BAN

In Singapore, young people are generally not taking up smoking, unlike the youths in many other countries, he said.

“Our youths today no longer see smoking as glamorous, and are aware of its harms,” he said.

He added that Singapore’s bigger challenge among young people is e-cigarettes, which are still tobacco products and harmful to users. Although banned, these illegal devices still find their way here, Dr Koh added.

“We will need to do more to enforce the current ban to push back against the tide of popularity and increasing use.

""If vaping becomes entrenched among the younger generation, it undoes all the progress we have made on curbing smoking, and will take an enormous effort over many years to curb its use,” he said.

Dr Koh added that although New Zealand has announced a cohort smoking ban, it promotes vaping as an alternative to smoking. Over time, the habit may shift from smoking to vaping, which is still harmful, he said.","SINGAPORE: Singapore is open to the idea of a cohort smoking ban, Senior Minister of State for Health Koh Poh Koon said in Parliament on Tuesday (Jan 11).

Five of the eight confirmed cases have died, including a health worker, and the remaining three are being treated. The agency also identified 161 contacts of those infected, who are currently being monitored.

“The efforts by Tanzania’s health authorities to establish the cause of the disease is a clear indication of the determination to effectively respond to the outbreak. We are working with the government to rapidly scale up control measures to halt the spread of the virus and end the outbreak as soon as possible,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Director for Africa.

While this is the first time Tanzania has recorded a Marburg case, the country has first-hand experience responding to other crises including COVID-19, cholera, and dengue within the past three years. In September 2022, The UN health agency conducted a strategic risk assessment that revealed the country is at high to very high risk for infectious diseases outbreaks.

“The lessons learnt, and progress made during other recent outbreaks should stand the country in good stead as it confronts this latest challenge,” said Dr Moeti. “We will continue to work closely with the national health authorities to save lives.”

Marburg virus commonly causes hemorrhagic fever, with a high fatality ratio of up to 88 per cent.

It is part of the same family as the virus that causes Ebola. Symptoms associated with the Marburg virus start suddenly, with high fever, severe headache, and intense malaise, said WHO.

The virus is commonly transmitted to humans from fruit bats and spreads through direct contact with bodily fluids of infected people, surfaces, and materials.

While there are no vaccines or antiviral treatments approved to treat the virus, supportive care, rehydration, and treatment of specific symptoms increase chances of survival.","Lab tests were carried out after eight people in the region developed symptoms of the “highly virulent” disease, including fever, vomiting, bleeding, and kidney failure.

104,104,https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/02/1110982,Healthcare waste from COVID threatens environment: WHO,"According to the agency’s Global analysis of healthcare waste in the context of COVID-19: status, impacts and recommendations, the mainly plastic trashthreatens human and environmental health, and exposes a dire need to improve waste management practices.

The sight of discarded masks, littering pavements, beaches and roadsides, has become a universal symbol of the on-going pandemic worldwide.

Speaking to journalists in Geneva, the agency’s chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the report “is a reminder that although the pandemic is the most severe health crisis in a century, it is connected with many other challenges that countries face.”

The estimates are based on the approximately 87,000 tonnes of personal protective equipment (PPE) that was procured between March 2020 and November 2021 and shipped through a joint UN emergency initiative. Most of this equipment is expected to have ended up as waste.

For the agency, this is just an initial indication of the scale of the problem. It does not consider any of the COVID-19 commodities procured outside of the initiative, nor waste generated by the public, like disposable masks.

COVID fallout

The analysis points out that over 140 million test kits, with a potential to generate 2,600 tonnes of non-infectious waste (mainly plastic) - and 731,000 litres of chemical waste (equivalent to one-third of an Olympic-size swimming pool - have been shipped.

At the same time, over 8 billion doses of vaccine have been administered globally producing 144,000 tonnes of additional waste in the form of syringes, needles, and safety boxes.

As the UN and countries grappled with the immediate task of securing and quality-assuring supplies of PPE, less attention and resources were devoted to the safe and sustainable management of this waste.

For the Executive Director of WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme, Dr Michael Ryan, this type of protection is vital, “but it is also vital to ensure that it can be used safely without impacting on the surrounding environment.”

This means having effective management systems in place, including guidance for health workers on what to do.

Tweet URL The #COVID19 pandemic has generated extra tonnes of waste & exposed cracks in waste management, everywhere.Waste must be reduced & managed safely, for the health of both people & the environment https://t.co/JsYeqvl7G6 pic.twitter.com/UfI0GRjBD1 World Health Organization (WHO) WHO

Lack of resources

Today, 30 per cent of healthcare facilities (60 per cent in the least developed countries) are not equipped to handle existing waste loads, let alone the additional waste.

This can expose health workers to needle injuries, burns and pathogenic microorganisms, said WHO. Communities living near poorly managed landfills and waste disposal sites can be impacted by contaminated air from burning waste, poor water quality, or disease carrying pests.

The Director for Environment, Climate Change and Health at WHO, Maria Neira, believes the pandemic has forced the world to reckon with this problem.

“Significant change at all levels, from the global to the hospital floor, in how we manage the healthcare waste stream, is a basic requirement of climate-smart health care systems”, she said.

Recommendations

The report lays out a set of recommendations, including eco-friendly packaging and shipping; purchasing safe and reusable PPE, made of recyclable or biodegradable materials; investment in non-burn waste treatment technologies; and investments in the recycling sector to ensure materials, like plastics, can have a second life.

For WHO, the health crisis also offers an opportunity to develop strong national policies and regulations, change behaviours, and increase budgets.

TheChair of the Health Care Waste Working Group, Dr Anne Woolridge, noted that there is a growing appreciation that health investments must consider environmental and climate implications.

“For example, safe and rational use of PPE will not only reduce environmental harm from waste, it will also save money, reduce potential supply shortages and further support infection prevention by changing behaviours”, she explained.

Pandemic update

Last Sunday, 30 January, marked two years since WHO declared COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern, the highest level of alarm under international law.

At the time, there were fewer than 100 cases and no deaths reported outside China.

Two years later, more than 370 million cases have been reported, and more than 5.6 million deaths, and WHO says the numbers are an underestimate.

Since the Omicron variant was first identified just 10 weeks ago, almost 90 million cases have been reported, more than in the whole of 2020.

The WHO Director-General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said that a narrative has taken hold in some countries that because of vaccines, and because of Omicron’s high transmissibility and lower severity, preventing transmission is no longer possible, and no longer necessary.

“Nothing could be further from the truth”, he said.

He noted that WHO is not calling for any country to return to lockdown, but all nations should continue to protect their people using every tool in the toolkit, not vaccines alone.

“It’s premature for any country either to surrender, or to declare victory”, he argued.","According to the agency’s Global analysis of healthcare waste in the context of COVID-19: status, impacts and recommendations, the mainly plastic trashthreatens human and environmental health, and exposes a dire need to improve waste management practices.

Some people with Crohn’s disease may benefit from reducing their intake of dietary fiber. This type of food is hard to digest and may aggravate symptoms, especially during a flare. Share on Pinterest Xvision/Getty Images Although dietary factors cannot cure or cause Crohn’s disease, they can affect its symptoms, especially during a flare. Doctors recommend that people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) follow a diet with a reduced fiber intake. However, it is important to consider that some types of fiber may benefit people with IBD. This article explores the different types of dietary fiber and their effects on Crohn’s disease. It also discusses what foods to eat and avoid, and what supplements to consider taking.

Overview of Crohn’s disease Crohn’s disease is a form of IBD. It is a long-term condition that causes irritation and inflammation of the digestive tract. The disease commonly affects the beginning of the large intestines and the lower part of the small intestines (ileum). However, it can affect any part of the digestive tract, from the mouth to the anus. About 3 million adults in the United States had the condition in 2015, with this figure having risen significantly over the last couple of decades. The exact cause of Crohn’s disease is unknown, but experts believe that the condition results from an abnormal immune response. Diet and nutrition play a significant role in controlling IBD symptoms, yet there is no single diet that works for everyone.

Types of dietary fiber No evidence suggests that any particular food or diet can cause, prevent, or cure Crohn’s disease. However, many doctors recommend a low fiber, or “low-residue,” diet. Fiber is a substance that remains undigested as it passes through the small intestine. It is present primarily in plant foods, such as fruits, nuts, grains, and vegetables. Different types of dietary fiber affect digestion in different ways. There are two main types of dietary fiber: soluble and insoluble. Learn more about soluble and insoluble fibers. Soluble fibers These fibers dissolve in water, which helps absorb the water in the gut. This slows the transit time of food through the gut. Soluble fiber takes on a gel-like consistency during digestion, which helps reduce diarrhea and delays the emptying of the intestine, especially during flares. Insoluble fibers These types of fibers do not dissolve in water but pool it into the gut. As a result, they move more quickly through the gut and are more difficult for the body to digest. They may aggravate symptoms and cause diarrhea, pain, and bloating. Insoluble fiber can also block the intestinal tract when there is severe inflammation or narrowing of the intestines, known as strictures, during flares. Learn more about Crohn’s disease and strictures.

Avoiding fiber Many studies actually report that avoiding fiber may not benefit people with Crohn’s disease. A 2015 study found that people with Crohn’s disease who did not avoid high fiber foods were approximately 40% less likely to have a flare than those who did avoid them. Another 2015 study found that a plant-based diet effectively reduced gut inflammation and promoted the overall health of people with IBD. However, the study authors mention that a low residue diet without insoluble fibers might accelerate an imbalance of microorganisms in the gut, called dysbiosis. They conclude that high amounts of dietary fiber are not harmful to people with IBD but instead seem favorable. Other research has also explored the benefits of consuming fiber and the lower likelihood of developing Crohn’s disease. A 2017 study found that a high fiber diet may reduce a person’s risk of developing the condition.

Benefits of keeping a food diary The same foods do not trigger symptoms in all people with Crohn’s disease. A person may wish to explore which foods are safe for them and which ones trigger symptoms. Keeping a food journal or diary and tracking their symptoms can help people determine which foods are causing problems. This information can be useful when a person wishes to discuss their treatment options with a doctor or dietitian.

“The moment I stepped on the beach at Maya Bay, it felt so relaxing. The sand was so white and so fine. The view of limestone cliffs on my left and right, embracing the lagoon of crystal clear water, was so pleasing to the eye,” said Oranee.

The 24-year-old tour guide from Krabi had never seen Maya Bay like this before.

“It’s a popular tourist attraction. There used to be a huge number of visitors on the beach every day, and boats too,” she added.

Years of mass tourism had a devastating impact on the ecosystem around the bay. In June 2018, the Thai government announced that the area will be closed to tourists, in order to allow nature to heal itself.

The area remained closed for more than three years before its reopening on Jan 1 this year. This followed a significant recovery of its ecosystem and came at a time when Thailand’s tourism sector badly suffered from the COVID-19 pandemic.","PHI PHI LEH, Thailand: Oranee Kittitorraneerut remembered feeling elated when her eyes swept the panoramic view of Maya Bay for the first time in more than three years.

The liver is one of the largest and most extraordinary organs in the body as it is a super organ that performs innumerable health functions while all other organs have specific or limited functions. Liver disease: Stages, symptoms, lifestyle changes to adapt and prevent it (Twitter/This_Life_Mag)

Till date, over 500 functions have been attributed to the liver and scientists say more may be discovered over time. The most important function of the liver is processing of all that we consume, whether it be food, alcohol, drugs or poisons and the liver gets damaged by all the toxins we consume. Infections in blood also reach the liver and inflict damage while many other disease processes, inflammations and diseases, including cancer in other organs, also target the liver.

Symptoms:

In an interview with HT Lifestyle, Dr Gaurav Chaubal, Director – Liver, Pancreas, Intestine Transplant Program and HPB Surgery at Global Hospital in Mumbai's Parel, listed possible symptoms that one should never avoid. They include:

1. Yellowing of your skin and eyeballs (jaundice)

2. Pain in your upper right abdomen.

3. Abdominal swelling (ascites)

4. Nausea.

5. A general sense of feeling unwell (malaise)

6. Disorientation or confusion.( hepatic encephalopathy)

7. Sleepiness.

5 stages of liver disease:

Explaining that fatty liver is accumulation of fat in the liver which can cause damage to the liver and may gradually progress to liver failure, Dr Sulaiman Ladhani, Consulting Chest Physician and MD Chest and Tuberculosis at Masina Hospital in Mumbai's Byculla, elaborated, “It can be either due to excessive alcohol consumption or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. It mainly occurs in overweight or obese people. Diabetic patients are at a more risk of having a fatty liver.”

He added, “Fatty liver is a result of abnormal merabolism and excess calories, fat absorbed from food which is transported to the liver and ultimately stored in the liver as fat. There are no symptoms of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease therefore it is called as a silent disease. It is usually identified coincidentally in ultra sonography or fibro scan.”

Dr Sulaiman Ladhani and Dr Gaurav Chaubal spilled the beans on the different stages of liver disease or fatty liver. They are:

Stage 1. Simple fatty liver - It occurs when the liver starts to build up fat. There is no inflammation or scaring in the liver at this point. There are no symptoms in the early stage. Thus many people are unaware that they have fatty liver. For many people, fatty liver does not progress with an unhealthy liver. With healthy diet and regular exercise, excess fat in the liver can be reduced. It is observed that approximately 10-20% of people with this simple fatty liver will go on to next stage.

Stage 2: Inflammation - Steato hepatitis occurs when the build up of fat in the liver cells is accompanied with some amount of inflammation. It affects around 5% of the population. If the amount of damage tissues increases the liver may eventually struggle to repair it fast enough. In this phase, the ongoing damage to liver cells from a number of agents and diseases cause the liver to get enlarged and the person experiences abdominal pain in the upper right. During this stage the condition may be treatable. However, in people with non-alcoholic fatty liver, there may be no prominent symptoms.

Stage 3: Fibrosis/Scarring - If the inflammation seen in stage 1 is left unchecked, the liver tissues slowly start scarring and the scarred tissue starts replacing the healthy liver tissue. The condition is called fibrosis. Here there is a persistence scar tissue in the liver and in the blood vessels around the liver. The liver can still function quite well at this stage and removing or treating the cause of the inflammation may prevent further progression or reverse some amount of damage. However if the scar tissue starts to replace a lot of normal tissue the function of the liver gradually starts getting affected. During this phase, proper medication and lifestyle changes can reverse the condition to a certain extent.

Stage 4: Cirrhosis of the Liver - At this stage, the scarring is complete and there is no possibility of the liver healing itself now. At this stage the liver stops functioning properly and the symptoms include jaundice where eyes and nails start looking yellow, dull ache in the lower part of the ribs or abdominal distension due to accumulation of fluid in the belly. The person starts losing appetite, weight loss occurs and other organs can get affected like kidneys brain and heart. Scar tissue in the cirrhosis is difficult to remove all though further progression can be halted if the positive agent is removed. Most of the people have early stage of the disease that is simple fatty liver or steato. Only a small number of it goes to next stages.

Stage 5: End-stage Liver Disease (ESLD) - Liver failure is of 2 types - acute liver failure happens quickly with span of 48-72 hours and is generally caused by reasons other than alcohol while chronic liver failure takes a long time to get there and is often caused by alcohol abuse, uncontrolled diabetes, hypertension or obesity. Other commoner reasons being viral hepatitis, autoimmune disease and some metabolic diseases. The cognitive or mental health also gets affected and the person feels confused or disoriented often. ESLD is generally fatal.

Stage 6: Liver Cancer - This results liver cancer which can happen any time in the liver and due to reasons other than liver disease (primary liver cancer). It can also develop during any of the above 4 stages and is not necessarily the last in the sequence. Just like ESLD, liver cancer is also fatal unless tumour is ablated, resected or liver transplant is done.

All you need to know about liver transplant:

Dr Gaurav Chaubal shared, “By and large liver transplant is required in three scenarios. First, when liver cirrhosis progress and symptoms are worsening despite medical treatment. Secondly, when other organs also start getting involved due to cirrhosis namely brain, kidneys and coagulation. Thirdly, when liver cancer develops on the background of liver cirrhosis.”

Dr Akash Shukla, Director, Hepatology at Sir HN Reliance Foundation Hospital revealed that following liver transplantation, there are 3 things which can affect the long term outcomes hence, need to be taken care of. He highlighted, “First, the medicines used to prevent rejection and ensure that the body accepts the liver these are called as immuno suppressant medicines, in the starting there are 3 medications and they gradually come down to just one medication a day beyond 1 year of the transplant but this one tablet has to be continued forever. There is no restriction to the lifespan of the new liver, if proper medication is taken. It can go on for a very long time.”

He added, “The second important precaution that a person has to take is the prevention of infection. The risk of infection is the highest in the first 3 months, and during this period one should avoid unnecessary contacts with people, has to live in a hygienic environment and has to eat well cooked or very clean food. However there is no need for complete isolation, and normal activities of the life can be continued, beyond 3 months the risk of infection goes down substantially and is usually not a problem unless there is a major exposure to a infecting causing microbes.”

The third point to be considered, as per Dr Akash Shukla, is taking care of other organs of the body. He stressed, “While the liver is doing very well, in the long run we need to take care of the other organs of the body and the important metabolic fictions like control of diabetes, blood pressure and ischemic heart disease by lifestyle modification into a healthy lifestyle and nutritious diet. Also, we have to be extremely vigilant about the development of cancers in people who have received organ transplant and for this a regular visit with the doctor and screening for the cancers, especially the head and neck cancers and skin cancers, is extremely important for the longevity of the people after transplants.”

Liver disease prevention tips:

According to Dr Sulaiman Ladhani, all the stages of the liver are associated with increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease such as heart attack and stroke before the liver failure occurs. Therefore maintaining a healthy diet and limiting sugar intake, quitting smoking and intake of alcohol along with exercise will help in the long run.

He advised, “Vitamin E is helpful in preventing further progression. It is very important to have more clarity on that. Diet modification and reduced calories, avoiding fast food, soft drinks and heavy meals must be done. Having healthy meals and increasing physical movement of the body, as advised by the doctor, is imperative. Regular liver check ups and appropriate medications are must. The progression of the disease is slow hence, the lifestyle is managed with proper diet as it can help to prevent the disease to progress further.”

Echoing the same, Dr Gaurav Chaubal suggested, “Making small changes in your lifestyle and eating pattern such as - starting your day right by eating a healthy breakfast, reducing salt and fat intake, avoiding too much processed or junk foods, detoxifying your system by taking a lot of fluids, indulging in healthy snacking, including plenty of fruits and veggies in your diet, avoiding consumption of excessive alcohol and daily exercise are some of the ways to prevent liver disease.”","Liver disease: Stages, symptoms, lifestyle changes to adapt and prevent it (Twitter/This_Life_Mag)Till date, over 500 functions have been attributed to the liver and scientists say more may be discovered over time.

Members of the House of Lords have defeated the Government by voting to improve transparency and accountability in NHS workforce planning, while also accepting measures that aim to embed research in the NHS and restrict junk food advertising.





The Health and Care Bill aims to improve health services in England by better joining up services, an emphasis on collaboration rather than competition, and a focus on improving health.

Strengthening workforce planning

Peers have successfully amended the Bill to ensure regular publication of current and future numbers of staff the health service needs. These figures will help inform long-term decisions about workforce planning in the NHS – something that has been missing for many years. A clear message has been sent by Peers to the Government that it must urgently address the persistent staff shortages faced by the NHS - a key stumbling block as the NHS looks to clear the growing backlog of heart care.

This amendment faces another hurdle when it returns to the Commons for further scrutiny, and we will continue to urge the Government not to overturn it.

Embedding research in the NHS

Junk food marketing

The Bill also contains vital policies which aim to limit the advertising of unhealthy food and drink on TV and online, as part of the Government’s landmark obesity strategy. Attempts to introduce an indefinite delay to their implementation were thankfully defeated by Peers. We have warned that delays to this vital evidence-based policy would be misguided, and that illness related to excess weight will continue to impact society unless decisive action is taken.

We will continue to work with colleagues from the Obesity Health Alliance (OHA) and others to ensure these measures are brought forward without major changes.

A major opportunity

John Maingay, our director of policy and influencing said:



“The Health and Care Bill is a major opportunity to set the right course for the nation’s health as we recover from the pandemic. The experience of the past couple of years has highlighted the value of cutting edge clinical research, and the need to embed it in the NHS. At the same time Covid-19 underlined the need to put in place measures which can help build a healthy and resilient population, such as those in the bill which will protect children from junk food advertising.



“We also saw NHS staff pushed to the limit like never before, as the pandemic laid bare serious workforce shortages in the health service. That is why it is crucial that the widely supported workforce amendment to the bill is backed by the Government. We look forward to all these important measures being passed into law as the Bill progresses.”

In January 2021, the 4 nations of the United Kingdom published the UK Rare Diseases Framework outlining national priorities for improving the lives of those affected by rare conditions. One year on, in this first England Rare Diseases Action Plan, we report on progress made, and take a significant step forward in transforming the collective priorities of the UK Rare Diseases Framework into tangible and concrete action.

Rare conditions are those that affect fewer than one in every 2,000 people. There are an estimated 7,000 different conditions and, owing to their rarity, people living with rare diseases face specific challenges with the health and care system, and with wider public services. The rare disease community includes:

those living with genetic and non-genetic conditions

those with a diagnosis and those who may never receive one

newborns, children and adults

While individually rare, rare diseases are collectively common. 1 in 17 people are affected by a rare condition at some point in their lifetime: in the UK alone, this amounts to over 3.5 million people.

Despite the immense strain coronavirus (COVID-19) has placed on the health and care system, the actions described in this plan are far-reaching and diverse, from piloting new approaches for patients with undiagnosed rare conditions through to monitoring the uptake of drugs for rare diseases to promote equal access throughout the country, determining how best to include rare diseases in health profession education and improving the way decisions are made on newborn screening for rare diseases.

These commitments have been developed collaboratively with our delivery partners across the health landscape and in close consultation with members of the rare disease community. To ensure delivery and accountability, each action lists an owner, desired outcomes and, crucially, how we will measure and report on progress.

An important step in addressing the challenges faced by the rare disease community, this action plan is the first in a series of annual updates reporting progress made and new initiatives. Over the course of this year, we will continue to work with delivery partners and the rare disease community to monitor progress, drive change, and step up engagement with other organisations with crucial roles in supporting people living with rare disease.

While the framework and action plan represent the government’s primary commitments to the rare disease community, it is also important to recognise the strengths of the UK in science and research, and the promise of wider initiatives in addressing the challenges of rare disease. Government strategies, including Genome UK , the Future of UK Clinical Research Delivery and the Life Sciences Vision, will all support work to continue improving the lives of patients – from those affected by the most common conditions to the very rarest of diseases.

This action plan, developed in close collaboration with the rare disease community, continues to build upon existing UK strengths and addresses areas of weaknesses, translating ambition into progress.

Thank you to all involved in the development of this plan and its future implementation – from officials working across the health and care system through to the clinicians and researchers, the dedicated patient organisations, and, most importantly, those personally affected by rare disease.

Executive summary

The UK government and devolved administrations published the UK Rare Diseases Framework in January 2021, setting out a shared vision for addressing health inequalities and improving the lives of people living with rare diseases across the UK . The framework outlined 4 key national priorities as follows:

helping patients get a final diagnosis faster

increasing awareness among healthcare professionals

better co-ordination of care

improving access to specialist care, treatment and drugs

To turn this vision into action, each of the 4 UK nations has committed to developing nation-specific action plans detailing how the priorities identified in the framework will be addressed.

This is England’s first Rare Diseases Action Plan, developed together with delivery partners across the health system and in close consultation with the rare disease community. It sets out specific, measurable actions for the next year under each of the 4 priority areas, including the outcomes that we aim to achieve.

Key commitments in this action plan include:

improving how decisions are made on newborn screening for rare diseases

designing an ethically approved research pilot using whole genome sequencing to screen for genetic conditions in healthy newborns

piloting new approaches for diagnosis and care of patients with undiagnosed rare conditions

determining how best to include rare diseases in UK health professional education and training frameworks

health professional education and training frameworks developing a toolkit to increase the effectiveness of virtual consultations for patients with rare diseases

supporting rapid access to drugs for patients with rare diseases in the NHS

monitoring the overall uptake of drugs for patients with rare diseases and mapping this access across the country

By bringing together many key organisations within the health system to deliver this action plan, we have a unique opportunity to tackle the challenges facing those living with rare diseases. Over the course of the coming year, we will monitor the progress of these actions closely, seeking input from those living with rare diseases to ensure we are measuring the outcomes that matter most.

However, we know that there is more to do, particularly as the health system begins to recover from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. While delivery of this first action plan is underway, we will continue to explore future directions and develop new actions, informed by the needs of the diverse rare disease community.

Through this action plan, we will take the first steps in England towards achieving our overarching vision – delivering improvements in diagnosis, awareness, treatment and care, and creating lasting positive change for those living with rare diseases.

Introduction

On 9 January 2021, the Department of Health and Social Care ( DHSC ) published the UK Rare Diseases Framework outlining a national vision for how the UK will improve the lives of those living with rare diseases.

All 4 nations of the UK have committed to developing clear and tangible action plans to deliver on our collective framework. This publication is England’s first Rare Diseases Action Plan, developed together with delivery partners across the health system and representatives of the rare disease community to bring about specific and measurable improvements for people living with a rare disease.

It is currently estimated that there are over 7,000 rare diseases, with new conditions continually being identified as research advances. While around 80% of rare diseases have an identified genetic origin, they can also be caused by other factors such as:

disordered immunity

infections

allergies

deterioration of body tissues and organs

disruption to development while in the womb

Although rare diseases are individually rare, they are collectively common – with 1 in 17 people being affected by a rare disease at some point in their lifetime. In the UK , this amounts to over 3.5 million people. It is important that the NHS and other services provide this large and diverse patient population with the best possible care.

Rare diseases can be both life limiting and life threatening, and disproportionately affect children. 75% of rare diseases affect children and more than 30% of children with a rare disease die before their fifth birthday.

People living with rare diseases and their families often face a lifetime of complex care, leading to a profound impact on their education, financial stability, physical mobility and mental health. It is vitally important that their voices are heard and acted on when developing wider policy.

UK Rare Diseases Framework

Development of the UK Rare Diseases Framework was based on the outcomes of the ‘National conversation on rare diseases’, which was launched by the government in 2019. The conversation gathered views across the rare disease community on the major challenges faced by people affected by rare conditions across the UK .

An impressive 6,293 responses were received, which helped identify 4 high-level priority areas to bring about real change, forming the basis of the UK Rare Diseases Framework. The 4 priorities are:

helping patients get a final diagnosis faster

increasing awareness among healthcare professionals

better co-ordination of care

improving access to specialist care, treatment and drugs

To turn these priorities into a reality, we recognise that significant action is needed across the health and social care system. In addition to the 4 priorities, the UK Rare Diseases Framework identifies 5 underpinning themes on which we will focus in support of the 4 priorities to improve the lives of those living with rare diseases. These themes are:

patient voice

national and international collaboration

pioneering research

digital, data and technology

wider policy alignment

UK -wide implementation

The UK Rare Diseases Framework is a UK -wide document. However, each of the 4 UK nations has its own delivery or implementation group, responsible for drafting and monitoring nation-specific action plans. All 4 nations have committed to publishing their action plans by the end of 2022.

Throughout development of the action plans, each nation is engaging with members of the rare disease community to make sure the work is both relevant and fit for purpose. Once published, action plans will be reviewed regularly to measure progress, update actions or add new ones.

Developing nation-specific action plans involves balancing the specific health needs of the individual UK nations with the government’s commitment to health equity and avoiding disparities.

To further help with implementation of the Framework, 2 UK -wide boards have been created, the:

UK Rare Disease Framework Board – providing high-level co-ordination of rare disease policy and action plans across the 4 UK nations

Rare Disease Framework Board – providing high-level co-ordination of rare disease policy and action plans across the 4 nations UK Rare Diseases Forum – providing a way to engage a wide range of stakeholders in the rare disease community for advice and input (see Figure 1 below).

The UK -wide UK Rare Diseases Framework Board provides strategic oversight and facilitates alignment of policy across the 4 UK nations. The UK Rare Diseases Forum, also UK -wide, provides a means of engagement with the community.

England Rare Diseases Action Plan

The England Rare Diseases Framework Delivery Group develops, oversees and co-ordinates delivery of England’s action plans. In addition to representatives of rare disease patient and public voice and the clinician community, it has brought together publicly funded delivery partners across the health system as major funders of rare diseases research, including:

NHS England and NHS Improvement ( NHSE/I )

England and Improvement ( ) the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence ( NICE )

) the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency ( MHRA )

) Health Education England ( HEE )

) the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service ( NCARDRS , NHS Digital)

, Digital) Genomics England

the National Institute for Health Research ( NIHR )

) Medical Research Council

Over the course of 2021, the delivery group has met every 6 weeks to develop and agree on actions that have formed the basis of the plan. Following publication of this action plan, the delivery group will continue to meet to co-ordinate and report on delivery, and develop actions for our second action plan in 2023.

As well as the publicly funded delivery partners (listed in Annex B whose actions are described here, there are also many other organisations with crucial roles in supporting people living with rare diseases and bringing about much needed change. These organisations include:

charities

patient advocacy groups

philanthropically funded organisations

independent policy institutes

industry

This action plan sits within this wider system and will help to facilitate continued engagement, increased co-ordination and more joined-up working with others.

Community engagement

In developing the UK Rare Disease Framework, and now this action plan, we have placed the needs of those living with rare diseases at the forefront.

With the support of Genetic Alliance UK , we recruited representatives of patient and public voice to both the England Rare Diseases Framework Delivery Group and UK Rare Diseases Framework Board. We have used the UK Rare Diseases Forum online platform to engage continuously with a broad range of people from the rare diseases community, providing an opportunity for discussion and feedback, as well as a source of updates on progress and related initiatives. We have also held two community roundtables to seek input on the draft actions and action Plan, again with participants recruited with support from Genetic Alliance UK .

In November 2021, we launched a targeted online questionnaire to gather detailed feedback on draft actions from people and organisations across the rare disease community. The questionnaire was open for 3 weeks and received 92 responses from:

people living with a rare disease

carers and family members

rare disease charities

healthcare professionals

industry partners

researchers

We also held a workshop in partnership with Breaking Down Barriers (a network of over 50 organisations working together to improve the lives of families from diverse and marginalised communities) to better understand health inequalities experienced by people from diverse and marginalised communities affected by rare conditions.

Our delivery partners have also proactively engaged and sought extensive feedback from the rare diseases community as they have developed their actions. For example, NHSE/I hosted engagement sessions with more than 80 individuals representing over 50 different organisations, including:

patient charities

patient advocacy groups

medical royal colleges

academics

Further details of engagement activities can be found in Annex C.

It is now a year since the UK Rare Diseases Framework was published. Alongside the work to produce this Action Plan, progress has already been made against the priorities of the Framework. Some of this progress is summarised below, with further details provided in Annex D.

Significant steps forward have been made in helping patients receive a diagnosis faster, with the NHS Genomic Medicine Service ( GMS ) carrying out over 600,000 genomic tests in England over the last year, many of which are for rare diseases.

The roll-out of the whole genome sequencing clinical service began in November 2021. Seven NHS Genomic Medicine Service Alliances have been established to support the embedding of genomic testing in end-to-end clinical pathways.

An initial national dialogue was held to explore public views on the implications of whole genome sequencing for newborns, and found the public was broadly supportive provided appropriate safeguards and resources are in place.

Additionally, the power of whole genome sequencing ( WGS ) to uncover new diagnoses for people living with rare diseases has been demonstrated through research such as the 100,000 Genomes Project and a study focusing on the use of WGS for investigating suspected mitochondrial disorders – both of which resulted in improved clinical decision-making for patients or their relatives.

Over the course of 2021, HEE has continued to develop bespoke education resources to underpin the implementation of the NHS GMS and raise awareness of rare disease among healthcare professionals.

Alongside this, work is ongoing to improve co-ordination of care across the health and social care system. This includes the NIHR -funded CoOrdinated Care of Rare Diseases ( CONCORD ) study, which aims to understand how care for people living with rare disease and common chronic conditions is currently co-ordinated, and how they would like it to be co-ordinated.

On access to specialist care, treatment and drugs, NICE recently announced a package of changes it will be making to its methods and processes for health technology evaluation. The changes will ensure its methods and processes are suited to new and emerging types of technology, and provide more equitable access for those with severe diseases. Changes to methods and processes that are relevant to rare diseases are included in this action plan.

In March 2021, we published Saving and Improving Lives: The Future of UK Clinical Research Delivery setting out our ambition to create a patient-centred, pro-innovation and digitally enabled clinical research environment. Implementing the vision will:

unleash the true potential of our clinical research environment to improve health

capitalise on our renowned research expertise

make the UK one of the best places in the world to design and deliver research

An additional £340 million of funding has also been announced for the Innovative Medicines Fund, which will provide early access to promising new medicines including cutting-edge gene therapies (see Box 1 for further information).

Further significant developments included NHSE/I the agreement of a number of ‘smart deals’ to secure innovative medicines. These included the 3 following treatments for patients with spinal muscular atrophy ( SMA ):

The NCARDRS has published studies on the impact of COVID-19 on the health of people with non-genetic rare diseases, helping to steer policy and leading to further pioneering research (see Annex D for further details).

Current context

Progress in developing this action plan has taken place against the backdrop of the current COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused significant disruption to health and care services. The effects are ongoing, with the emergence of the Omicron variant and the need to support the vital increase in the vaccination programme having had a significant national impact on the NHS .

The impact of the pandemic has been particularly severe on the rare disease community, as highlighted by the Action for Rare Disease Empowerment ( ARDEnt ) report Making the Unseen Seen: Rare disease and the lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic and a 2020 EURORDIS-Rare Disease Europe Rare Barometer survey How has COVID-19 impacted people with rare diseases?.

A focus on COVID-19 has meant that some routine and primary care services have been scaled back, leading to delays or cancellations in diagnostic testing, transfusions, surgeries, scans and routine appointments.

Similarly, safety considerations, redeployed staff and travel restrictions have caused additional barriers to rare disease research, where cohort sizes are already small.

Resources have also been diverted to much-needed COVID-19 initiatives, including the development of both vaccines and therapeutics against severe disease. This has affected the operations of many other services and, while we recognise these need to be built back up, this will take time.

Plans are underway to put workforce and technology at the heart of long-term planning across the health service. It was recently announced that HEE , NHS Digital, NHSX and NHSE/I are to become one organisation. This will enable patients to benefit from the best care possible, thanks to a highly skilled workforce and faster digitalisation services. By transitioning these organisations into one, the government and the NHS are ensuring the health and social care sector is fully equipped to face the future and deliver for patients. While work will be needed to finalise logistics, the changes will ultimately:

better support the recovery of the NHS

address waiting list backlogs

support hardworking staff

drive forward an ambitious agenda of digital transformation and progress

Our commitment to improving the lives of those living with rare diseases remains as strong as ever, and we will look to learn lessons from the experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic. While ambitious, this action plan is therefore also realistic, recognising that it may take time to implement change within the current context.

The actions this year build on the existing strengths of our delivery partners and, in many cases, highlight work already underway. However, by publishing them as actions together in this plan, we aim to increase transparency and visibility of progress for the rare diseases community.

We know that it has not been possible to address all the community’s concerns within this first action plan, and we will continue to engage with the rare disease community to determine how further progress can be made in future annual updates to the action plan.

Below, we set out our plans for the year ahead. Additionally, the ‘Future directions’ section of this action plan lists further focus areas identified by the rare disease community to which we will turn our attention over the course of the next year, as services begin to recover from the pandemic.

Addressing the priorities of the framework: actions for 2021 to 2022

The 4 priorities of the UK Rare Diseases Framework have been highlighted as major challenges by the rare disease community. Progress in these areas is vital to meet our commitment to improve the lives of those living with rare conditions.

Here, we describe actions under each of the 4 priority areas for the next year, including the outcomes that we aim to achieve. Each action is described below with further information provided in Table 1 in Annex A This table provides details on each action’s owner alongside how progress will be measured. This will be reported publicly to aid transparency and accountability, and make progress as visible as possible to the rare diseases community. As well as these specific actions, which we will measure and report on, the narrative text below also describes many supporting activities that will all contribute to making progress on the aims of the framework.

Funding for all the actions listed below is already committed, either through delivery partners’ existing organisational budgets, or accounted for in the 2021 Autumn Budget and Spending Review. In this budget, the Chancellor announced a £5 billion investment over the next 3 years to increase health-related research and development. This includes funding to support Genomics England’s research initiative, a national research pilot testing 100,000 newborns using WGS to detect rare diseases with a genetic cause.

Priority 1: helping patients get a final diagnosis faster

Getting a rapid and accurate diagnosis is of vital importance for people living with rare diseases and their loved ones. An accurate and timely diagnosis can:

facilitate access to treatment and care

provide a possible prognosis

offer options for family planning

provide a means of connection with a supportive community

open up the possibility of involvement in research, including clinical trials

In some cases, if a condition is diagnosed before the onset of symptoms, it may be possible to limit or even prevent harm.

Importantly, a correct diagnosis also ends what, for many, can be a lengthy ‘diagnostic odyssey’. The complex nature of many rare conditions means that patients may undergo multiple referrals, inconclusive tests and sometimes incorrect diagnoses before a final diagnosis is reached, during which time their condition may deteriorate, as well as having a negative impact on mental health.

Delayed diagnosis may also mean missing the window of opportunity for certain treatments, such as gene therapies, resulting in poorer outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated challenges in patients receiving a timely diagnosis.

Alongside great personal cost, research from 2018 estimated that, over a 10-year period, the ‘diagnostic odyssey’ for rare diseases has cost NHS England in excess of £3.4 billion.

Genomics offers enormous potential for increasing diagnosis of rare disease and several of the actions under priority 1 make use of advances in genomics. This is a strength in the UK and our 2020 strategy Genome UK : the future of healthcare sets out our ambition to create the most advanced genomic health system in the world. However, it is important to recognise that 20% of rare diseases do not have a known genetic basis and many rare diseases remain undiagnosed.

We have taken this into account throughout this action plan and, under this priority, action 5 is specifically focussed on patients with undiagnosed rare conditions.

Action 1: improving how decisions are made on newborn screening for rare diseases

Newborn screening plays an important role in diagnosing rare diseases early, offering opportunities for treatment, management and support - often before symptoms even develop. This is particularly important because 75% of all rare diseases affect children, accounting for about a third of infant mortality in the UK .

The UK National Screening Committee ( UK NSC ) advises ministers and the NHS in all 4 UK countries on all aspects of screening. Using research evidence, pilot programmes and economic evaluation, the committee assesses the evidence for national screening programmes against a set of internationally recognised criteria, taking a range of different factors into account.

Proposals to screen for new conditions are considered in an annual call for topics that runs between September and December each year. Currently, 9 rare conditions are screened for in newborns through the NHS newborn blood spot screening srogramme.

As part of England’s Rare Diseases Action Plan, the DHSC commits to improving how decisions are made across the UK on newborn screening for rare diseases. In the year ahead. this will be actioned through:

a new UK NSC with a broader remit, revised terms of reference and greater collaboration with researchers and stakeholders, including those with an interest in rare disease

with a broader remit, revised terms of reference and greater collaboration with researchers and stakeholders, including those with an interest in rare disease the establishment of a UK NSC Bloodspot Task Group to identify practical and innovative approaches to facilitate research and evidence, which will inform evaluations of blood spot screening

Opportunities will also be taken to engage internationally, and learn from and contribute to international best practice on screening. Work is underway to produce a paper that compares the UK NSC bloodspot screening policy processes and programme delivery to proposed EURORDIS newborn screening criteria to identify any areas of good practice and areas for improvement. This will provide an understanding of how UK screening policy and practice compares with an important patient-defined checklist.

Further details of UK NSC ’s international activities are provided in the ‘National and international collaboration’ section.

The new UK NSC is set to commence work in summer 2022.

Action 2: WGS to screen for genetic conditions in healthy newborns

Scientific advances mean that there are an increasing number of conditions where interventions are available to reduce or avoid harm, or improve long-term outcomes, if the condition is detected early. WGS could significantly increase the diagnoses of genetic conditions not currently covered by the NHS newborn blood spot screening programme.

Guided by the outputs of the public dialogue on WGS in newborns published in July 2021, Genomics England and NHSE/I are leading a programme to explore the benefits, risks and broader implications of WGS in newborns.

This includes co-designing and running an ethically approved research pilot using WGS to screen for rare genetic conditions in healthy newborns. New funding for this research pilot was announced in the October 2021 Spending Review. The research pilot will:

sequence the genomes of up to 100,000 newborns and follow their progress to better understand the clinical benefits and potential risks of newborn genomic screening, aiming to accelerate diagnoses and access to treatments for rare genetic conditions

be designed through careful consultation with the rare disease community, healthcare professionals, the UK National Screening Committee and other key stakeholders – for instance, through their NHS Steering Group

National Screening Committee and other key stakeholders – for instance, through their Steering Group include careful testing of how the whole pathway – from diagnosis through to genetic counselling and care – can be rolled out within the NHS , if there is proven benefit

, if there is proven benefit ensure robust processes are in place for consent, return of results, data use and access

develop a framework to identify genes for targeted analysis, based on clinical and genomic evidence and wide consultation. Outputs from the consultation to date have led towards a focus on diseases that present in early childhood for the research pilot, where an outcome-changing action would be available if they were detected earlier

improve understanding of the patient experience of genomic newborn screening

provide evidence to support the UK NSC to make recommendations for future NHS screening programmes

Action 3: continuously develop the National Genomic Test Directory

For the approximately 80% of rare diseases with a genetic origin, the systematic application of genomic technologies has the potential to transform patients’ lives. It can enable quicker diagnoses in both adults and children, and match patients to the most effective medications and interventions.

The NHS Genomic Medicine Service ( GMS ) continues to support the implementation of the UK Rare Diseases Framework through:

The National Genomic Test Directory sets out the genomic testing strategy, which is delivered through the NHS GMS . It currently includes 357 rare and inherited clinical indications, and is reviewed every year to make sure it reflects the latest scientific and technological developments, including new rare disease clinical indications.

The NHS GMS continues to expand the range of testing technologies it offers as it moves towards targeted and personalised care – including single gene tests, larger next-generation sequencing panel tests to help diagnose based on broader phenotypes, exome sequencing and WGS – to help improve diagnostic yield.

In 2022, steps will be taken to continuously develop the National Genomic Test Directory by adding new tests for rare diseases where there is scientific and clinical evidence to do so.

Action 4: further develop the Genomics England clinical research interface

Over the next year, Genomics England commits to further developing its clinical research interface so that, when genomic researchers find information of relevance to an individual’s health, it can be passed back to the NHS . This will support researchers and clinicians in collaborating to resolve complex or novel findings from genome data.

This action builds on existing systems and processes in place for participants from the 100,000 Genomes Project and patients accessing the NHS GMS , who have opted to make their de-identified data available to researchers from academia or industry in the National Genomic Research Library. The library is a comprehensive database that provides access for approved researchers to de-identified genomic data, health data and samples.

This action ","One year on, in this first England Rare Diseases Action Plan, we report on progress made, and take a significant step forward in transforming the collective priorities of the UK Rare Diseases Framework into tangible and concrete action.

The international animal health agency (OIE) is also being notified.

Lumpy skin disease is a viral disease of cattle and buffalo that can cause painful skin lesions, fever, watery eyes, loss of appetite, and a reluctance to move.

It has serious animal production implications including emaciation, decreased milk production, damaged hides and reproductive losses. While signs of disease may not be noticeable in some infected animals, in some cases it can kill the animal.

In an update issued last week, Australia’s chief veterinary officer Dr Mark Schipp warned LSD poses serious trade impacts across the live animal trade, and for exporters of dairy products, genetic materials, hides and some meat products.

It is probable that the infection was transmitted across the Malacca straights from Malaysia. The straits are only 65 km wide at their narrowest point.

It now appears likely that the virus will spread through the rest of the Indonesian archipelago to the south and east.

Once LSD reaches the eastern island of Timor, Australia will be the next country under threat.

Lumpy skin disease (LSD) is primarily transmitted by biting insects including flies and mosquitoes.

Transmission is also possible through direct contact.

LSD virus is very resistant and can survive in favourable environmental conditions for many months. It is transportable on equipment including footwear.

The disease originated in southern Africa but since the 1970’s has extended north and east through the Middle East then Turkey, Russia and China.

Since 2019 it has been spreading through Asia including India, Taiwan and Vietnam.

In 2021 it was reported in Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and most recently in peninsular Malaysia.

Given the history of transmission to date, there is a real possibility that Australia will become infected with this very serious bovine disease with marginal vaccines as our only protection.

Map from the OIE website in late 2021 showing ongoing LSD outbreaks in orange.

Why the disease presents a threat the Australian cattle industry

There are two main reasons why this disease presents an extremely serious threat to the Australian cattle industry:

Firstly, transmission by insects means that conventional quarantine, border controls and biosecurity are largely ineffective. With the island of Timor only 800 km from the Australian mainland, it is feasible that infected insects could travel across the ocean on the Northeast monsoon.

If the disease enters Australia, it is likely to infect the northern tropics where 100 percent cattle control is not possible so even if a vaccine is available, some animals will miss out during routine musters allowing the disease to continue to circulate in the unvaccinated stock. The large herd of wild buffalo in the Northern Territory also represents a serious potential reservoir of infection.

Secondly, the only vaccines available are far from ideal. All of the useful vaccines contain live attenuated virus. I have spoken to a dairy vet in Thailand last week who advised that while unexposed dairy cattle respond well to the vaccine with negligible side effects, dairy herds which have already been exposed to natural infection show a low level of clinical signs such as fever and skin lumps following vaccination. Despite these concerns about vaccination, Thai dairy farmers have generally decided to use the available vaccine because natural infection in unvaccinated cattle has been producing severe signs and economic loss in 30 to 40 percent of animals in the herd including fever, weight loss, reduced milk production, reduced conception rates, some abortions, secondary infections and mortalities in calves. Once the herds have been vaccinated the main focus of the disease is in calves. I have also had advice that when the vaccine was used in large dairy herds in China that there were negligible clinical signs.

Photo from the internet: The impact on the dairy industry is likely to be greatest as infection results in a significant reduction in milk production which usually lasts for the remainder of the lactation period.

The distance between Timor and Australia is about 800km. During the Northeast monsoon prevailing winds blow from the north and west across Indonesia towards the top end of Australia.

With only Java and the Eastern Islands of Indonesia standing between the Sumatran outbreak and a serious threat to Northern Australia, the Australian government will no doubt be providing every assistance possible to Indonesia to help it arrest the transmission of the virus. Indonesia has only a small but valuable cattle and buffalo herd (official statistics say 17 million head) which is likely to be devastated if the virus is not prevented from spreading throughout the archipelago.

In my opinion, this disease represents the most serious threat to the Australian cattle industry that I have seen since leaving veterinary school in 1975.

Apart from the usual biosecurity protocols, one thing that the Australian government and industry could do to protect our cattle herd from potential disaster is to harness the latest vaccine technologies that have been developed during the Covid 19 pandemic to very quickly produce a new and highly effective vaccine in time to stop LSD in its tracks.

116,116,https://www.outsourcing-pharma.com/Article/2022/02/24/report-spotlights-unique-challenges-of-rare-disease-patients,Report shines a light on unique challenges of rare disease patients,"“Rare disease​” could be considered a misnomer. True, one of these conditions might be by itself uncommon, but collectively, rare diseases impact millions of people around the world. Such patients can feel alone as they struggle with receiving an accurate diagnosis, connecting with adequate care, and accessing resources—problems that can be greatly exacerbated for patients from underrepresented communities.

Global Genes has released its 2022 Rare Disease Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Report: Turning Words Into Action to help shine a light on some of the challenges faced by rare disease patients. Outsourcing-Pharma recently connected with Craig Martin, CEO of the rare-disease solutions organization, to learn more about the report and what it reveals about issues in the rare disease space.

OSP: Could you tell us about some of the challenges that patients who live with a rare disease and are a member of a minority community face?​

CM: People living with rare diseases are already inherently underserved. Although roughly 10% of the global population has a rare disease, people with rare conditions endure extended diagnostic odysseys and struggle to get their conditions recognized and prioritized. If or when finally diagnosed, which on average takes five to seven years, they face a 95% probability that their rare disease doesn’t have an approved treatment.

These challenges and disparities are even greater for communities of color and other minoritized populations. These groups face biases and a lack of access to testing that further extends the time to diagnosis and limits access to clinical trials and treatments, if available. They often struggle to connect with others in their disease community and to find and receive treatment from qualified medical specialists, which further diminishes their potential for positive outcomes.

OSP: Please share why Global Genes and the Rare Disease Diversity Coalition (RDCC) decided to launch the RARE Health Equity Summit, and what happened at the inaugural event in November.​

CM: For rare disease patients, the challenges are many, but for people of color with a rare disease, these challenges are compounded. Communities of color are underrepresented in genome-wide association studies and clinical trials, and often face significant additional barriers in access to diagnosis, treatment, and care.

The RARE Health Equity Summit was part of three initiatives born out of the Global Genes partnership with the RDDC. The RDDC brings together rare disease experts, health and diversity advocates, and industry leaders to identify and advocate for evidence-based solutions to alleviate the disproportionate burden of rare diseases on communities of color.

The RDCC mission aligns with that of Global Genes, which is to connect, empower, and inspire the rare disease community to stand up, stand out and become more effective on their own behalf. These efforts help spur innovation, meet essential needs, build capacity and knowledge and drive progress within and across rare diseases.

The Summit gathered key rare disease constituents to explore persistent gaps in diagnosis and access to treatment for underserved/underrepresented patient communities, and to align on how to address these inequities. The Summit also served as a kick-off event for a broader partnership between Global Genes and RDDC.

The partnership currently is focused on rolling out two initiatives. The Know Your Family History Initiative​ is an 18-month, multi-channel patient education, engagement, and mobilization initiative, building awareness around the importance of knowing and documenting your family health history, which can be a critical barrier to early and accurate diagnosis and the corresponding access to trials and treatment for rare disease patients from communities of color.

The Open Data Initiative ​will create and establish a large-scale information and data gathering effort to help identify and elucidate the unique experiences, challenges, and outcomes of rare disease patients from communities of color in diagnosis, care, and treatment, generating insights, setting metrics and tracking improvements and trends over time.

OSP: Could you please share why you decided to create the Rare Disease Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion report?​

Craig Martin, CEO, Global Genes

CM: Shining a light on what we know, and don’t know, about the experiences of rare disease patients from diverse and underserved populations builds a foundation for action. If we can have open, transparent, and (where possible) data-driven conversations that help us pinpoint and prioritize gaps, needs, and interventions, then we can mobilize the entire community to get behind solutions.

The 2022 Rare Disease Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Report: Turning Words Into Action​ is an important step in that process. The report provides an opportunity to reflect on the past year and a framework for future efforts.

OSP: What are some of the key findings shared in the report?​

CM: One, COVID-19 helped to illuminate challenges, and magnify disparities that those in the rare disease community face. The speed with which the industry was able to adapt to telehealth, new trial methods, faster research, and drug development, proves that we can make more impactful moves when it comes to those in the RARE disease community.

Also, there is a deep need for educational materials that are accessible and digestible for rare disease patients because too often patients are left to do their own research, while also fighting to advocate for themselves throughout an exhausting diagnostic odyssey. When we connect patients to each other and provide accessible educational materials and programs, it helps to cut down the time to diagnosis and get treatments to patients faster.

Then, we also need to provide more resources to healthcare professionals, including exposure to the experiences of rare disease patients and families, expanding their training, building empathy, and extending their ability to recognize characteristics of rare diseases.

The report also includes insights gleaned from other Global Genes programs and partnerships, such as:

Health Equity RARE Patient Impact Grants,​ awarded to 10 rare disease patient organizations to expand their research, resource development, outreach, education, and awareness efforts supporting cultural competency

Financial Advocacy RARE Patient Impact Grants​, provided to rare disease patient organizations to promote financial advocacy among rare disease organizations and the people they serve

The RARE Compassion Program,​ an initiative that connects medical students with individuals and families with rare diseases to help foster meaningful doctor-patient relationships, inspire careers in rare disease care and research, and ultimately, through patient-centric listening and interactions, build the next generation of future medical professionals as key advocates for their patients.

OSP: What insights might the report offer for pharma companies and their research partners about rare-disease treatment R&D?​

CM: While some progress has been made over the last year, there is still a lot of work to be done, and we need sustained support and investment in these efforts to achieve meaningful impact. R&D focus and effort can quickly shift to larger disease areas, bigger populations, and later-stage assets, which could leave minoritized populations in already underserved rare conditions without hope or options.

We need for the entire community to mobilize around scientific, technological, business, and policy approaches that ensure advancements in diagnosis and treatment are inclusive of all rare disease patients. Finally, we must work together as a community to reach out, break down barriers, embrace and include those who’ve been left out and collaborate to ensure other stakeholders do the same.

According to the American Heart Association, heart disease is the leading cause of death globally. On average, someone dies of heart disease every 36 seconds in the United States. Although many factors contribute to one’s heart health, wholesome nutrition is a major factor in combating plaque buildup in coronary arteries, which results in the most common type of heart disease, coronary artery disease.

February is American Heart Month, and experts from the University of Alabama at Birmingham Cardiovascular Institute recommend that everyone incorporate heart-healthy foods and nutrients into their daily diet to prevent cardiovascular disease and maintain a healthy heart.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that a poor diet — among diabetes, obesity, physical inactivity and excessive alcohol use — is one of the most influential lifestyle choices that put people at a higher risk for heart disease. Experts encourage limiting sugary drinks, sweets, fatty or processed meats, solid fats, and salty or highly processed foods to maintain a heart-healthy diet.

Jody Gilchrist, a nurse practitioner at UAB Medicine’s Heart and Vascular Clinic at Acton Road, says eating fresh fruits and vegetables cooked using a low-fat method are great for heart health.

“When choosing heart-healthy foods, it is important to stick to vegetables that have a rich color like spinach, avocados, bell peppers, carrots and zucchini,” Gilchrist said. “Some heart-healthy fruit options include strawberries, blueberries and blackberries. These are all full of important nutrients that play a central role in heart health.”

Gilchrist reminds people that it is important to not substitute fresh fruits with 100 percent fruit juice or sweetened dried fruit due to the high amount of sugar in both options.

Foods that are high in fiber also play a large role in protecting heart health. Whole grains are good sources of fiber and other nutrients that help regulate blood pressure and maintain heart health.

An easy way to incorporate whole grains into one’s diet is to replace refined grains with whole grains. Refined grains have been processed in a way that removes the bran and germ, stripping the grain of important nutrients the body needs. Choosing whole-grain bread instead of white bread or whole-wheat pasta instead of egg noodles are good examples of how people can incorporate whole grains into their diet. These small substitutions add up when it comes to maintaining heart health.

“The benefits of foods rich in fiber go beyond just heart health,” Gilchrist said. “Foods that are rich in fiber, vitamins and minerals can make you feel full longer, lower bad cholesterol, control blood pressure and help you maintain a healthy weight.”

In addition to choosing heart-healthy ingredients, the CDC recommends cooking meals at home to maintain a healthy and balanced diet.

“When you cook at home, you have more control over which ingredients are included in the dish, and you can adjust these ingredients based on your preferences,” Gilchrist said. “Cooking at home also saves money, and with so many easy recipes available, it saves time too.”

Approved as a Long-Term Enzyme Replacement Therapy in Combination with Miglustat for All Adults Living with Late-Onset Pompe Disease

CHMP Opinion for Miglustat, the Oral Enzyme Stabilizer Component of AT-GAA, On-Track for 2Q 2023

PHILADELPHIA, March 27, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Amicus Therapeutics (Nasdaq: FOLD), a patient-dedicated global biotechnology company focused on developing and commercializing novel medicines for rare diseases, today announced that the European Commission (EC) has granted approval for Pombiliti™ (cipaglucosidase alfa), a long-term enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) used in combination with miglustat for adults with late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD). The Company has submitted the previously requested analytical testing for miglustat, the enzyme stabilizer component of AT-GAA. The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) opinion for miglustat is expected in the second quarter of 2023.

“Late-onset Pompe disease is a rare, neuromuscular disorder that can have devastating consequences for patients and their families. The European Commission approval for Pombiliti is another major step towards bringing this much needed, new treatment for all adults living in the EU with late-onset Pompe disease. It is the realization of the work of so many individuals and teams dedicated to the mission of improving the lives of people living with Pompe disease,” said John F. Crowley, Executive Chairman of Amicus Therapeutics, Inc.

""We are extremely pleased with the EC approval of Pombiliti, an innovative enzyme replacement therapy that is intended for use in combination with the oral enzyme stabilizer miglustat. We are grateful to the Pompe community who have helped advance this therapy, especially the patients, families, and physicians around the world who participated in our clinical studies. Given the strength of the label and our launch readiness, we believe there is significant commercial opportunity, and that AT-GAA has the potential to become the next standard of care in Pompe disease by redefining the therapeutic expectations of people living with Pompe disease and of their caregivers. Once both components are approved, we look forward to bringing AT-GAA to people in Europe living with LOPD as rapidly as possible,” said Bradley Campbell, President and Chief Executive Officer of Amicus Therapeutics, Inc.

Story continues

The EC based its approval on clinical data from the Phase 3 pivotal study (PROPEL), the only randomized, controlled trial in LOPD to include patients in the high unmet need ERT-experienced population, in addition to ERT-naïve patients. The EC approval of Pombiliti follows the positive opinion previously granted by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP).

About AT-GAA

AT-GAA is an investigational two-component therapy that consists of cipaglucosidase alfa, a bis-M6P-enriched rhGAA which facilitates high-affinity uptake through the M6P receptor while retaining its capacity for processing into the most active form of the enzyme, and the oral enzyme stabilizer, miglustat, that’s designed to minimize loss of enzyme activity in the blood. In clinical studies, AT-GAA was associated with demonstrated improvements in both musculoskeletal and respiratory measures.

About Pompe Disease

Pompe disease is an inherited lysosomal disorder caused by deficiency of the enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA). Reduced or absent levels of GAA lead to accumulation of glycogen in cells, which is believed to result in the clinical manifestations of Pompe disease. Pompe disease ranges from a rapidly fatal infantile form with significant impacts to heart function, to a more slowly progressive, late-onset form primarily affecting skeletal muscle and progressive respiratory involvement. Late-onset Pompe disease can be severe and debilitating, including progressive muscle weakness throughout the body, particularly the skeletal muscles and muscles controlling breathing, that worsens over time.

Important Safety Information

Pombiliti (cipaglucosidase alfa) Important Safety Information

Posology and Method of Administration: Pombiliti must be used in combination with miglustat 65 mg hard capsules. The recommended dose of Pombiliti is 20 mg/kg of body weight every other week. The Pombiliti infusion should start 1 hour after taking miglustat capsules. Paediatric population: The safety and efficacy of Pombiliti in combination with miglustat therapy in paediatric patients less than 18 years old have not yet been established. No data are available. Contraindications: Life-threatening hypersensitivity to the active substance, or to any of the excipients. Contraindication to miglustat. Anaphylaxis and infusion-associated reactions (IARs): Serious anaphylaxis and IARs have occurred in some patients during infusion and following infusion with Pombiliti. Premedication with oral antihistamine, antipyretics, and/or corticosteroids may be administered to assist with signs and symptoms related to IARs experienced with prior enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) treatment. Reduction of the infusion rate, temporary interruption of the infusion, symptomatic treatment with oral antihistamine, or antipyretics, and appropriate resuscitation measures should be considered to manage serious IARs. If anaphylaxis or severe allergic reactions occur, infusion should be immediately paused, and appropriate medical treatment should be initiated. The current medical standards for emergency treatment of anaphylactic reactions are to be observed and cardiopulmonary resuscitation equipment should be readily available. The risks and benefits of re-administering Pombiliti following anaphylaxis or severe allergic reaction should be carefully considered, and appropriate resuscitation measures made available. Risk of acute cardiorespiratory failure in susceptible patients: Patients with acute underlying respiratory illness or compromised cardiac and/or respiratory function may be at risk of serious exacerbation of their cardiac or respiratory compromise during infusions. Appropriate medical support and monitoring measures should be readily available during Pombiliti infusion. Immune complex-related reactions: Immune complex-related reactions have been reported with other ERTs in patients who had high IgG antibody titres, including severe cutaneous reactions and nephrotic syndrome. If immune complex-related reactions occur, discontinuation of the administration of Pombiliti should be considered and appropriate medical treatment should be initiated. The risks and benefits of re-administering Pombiliti following an immune complex-related reaction should be reconsidered for each individual patient. Contraception in females: Reliable contraceptive measures must be used by women of childbearing potential during treatment with Pombiliti in combination with miglustat, and for 4 weeks after discontinuing treatment.

From the mother who spends hours at a clinical study site while her 3-year-old daughter receives an experimental treatment for spinal muscular atrophy, resolutely hopeful that she will someday be able to walk, to the occupational therapist spending weeks with a teenage boy with retinitis pigmentosa, helping him learn how to navigate the world when his sight finally goes completely – the annual Rare Disease Day (https://www.rarediseaseday.org/), held on 28 February, is a key date in the calendar for everyone affected by a rare disease. It has the ambitious aim of raising awareness among multiple stakeholders (including healthcare professionals, policymakers, industry and the public) of conditions so rare that few will have heard of them. Only with increased awareness can we catalyse change for the patients, families and carers around the world who are impacted.

Despite the profound impacts of COVID-19 seen far and wide across all areas of healthcare over the last 2 years, we’ve continued learning – and progress in rare disease has continued in leaps and bounds. So, as we mark this year’s Rare Disease Day, it’s a good opportunity to reflect on the recent advances that bring hope for the future.

Collaboration

Progress would not be possible without collaboration at all stages in the commercialisation of rare disease drugs, from clinical development to product launch, to those working hard to elevate the patient voice and drive legislative change. Central to this is the involvement of patient advocacy groups, patients and caregivers – who are relentless in their quest to ensure no patient goes unheard. And those voices are heard; since last year’s Rare Disease Day, a search of PubMed yields more than 25,000 new articles on rare disease. This is perhaps not surprising: while the prevalence of each rare disease is low, their aggregate impact is similar to, or greater than, many disease areas (including diabetes, breast cancer and Alzheimer’s disease).

The interest from the pharmaceutical industry is also significant. Orphan drug sales are expected to account for approximately 20% of US drug sales by 2024, and the non-profit organisation Global Genes’ upcoming NEXT 2022 report highlights the growing interest and investor confidence in rare disease drug development; a total of $22.9 billion was raised through public and private equity and debt financings in 2021, a 28% increase over the $18 billion raised in 2020. However, challenges in the commercialisation of rare disease treatments persist. In an ongoing effort to address these challenges, the Rare Disease Company Coalition (https://www.rarecoalition.com/) was launched ­in 2021. The Coalition represents an international group of life science companies (with 225 rare disease development programmes in progress) that are committed to discovering, developing and delivering rare disease treatments. Their goal is to inform and educate policymakers on the unique considerations faced when developing and bringing a drug to market.

In addition to pharmaceutical company involvement, several advocacy groups are also driving clinical research and the development of technologies such as gene therapy, gene editing and antisense oligonucleotides. The non-profit organisation Cure Rare Disease (https://www.cureraredisease.org/) is one such example. Founded by Rich Horgan, whose brother suffers from Duchenne muscular dystrophy, its goal is to develop customised therapies to treat patients with rare genetic conditions.

Empowering patients

Empowered patients can inform better and more effective trial design, ensuring that R&D programmes provide results that bring value to patients, enable a greater patient (and site) experience, and ultimately bring innovative treatments to patients faster. The DevelopAKUre consortium, a European collaboration involving academia, industry and patient organisations, demonstrated this recently when they partnered to accelerate the development of a treatment for alkaptonuria – a rare disorder caused by a genetic deficiency in an enzyme involved in tyrosine metabolism, which results in a build-up of homogentisic acid, manifesting in ‘black urine’ (Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases). Their position statement provides recommendations to support best practice, including preparation, building a consortium, funding, and patient recruitment and retention. Key to their success was equal partnership between all members of the consortium and the central role of the patient organisation, which ensured the needs of the clinical study participants were met in real-time, which not only accelerated enrolment but also led to a high retention rate.

Early diagnosis and new technologies

Shortening the diagnostic journey is a major focus of advocacy groups; a correct diagnosis can take 6–8 years for some rare diseases and involves visits to multiple physicians. The International Rare Diseases Research Consortium (IRDiRC), a joint initiative of the European Commission and the US National Institutes of Health, is committed to ensuring that each patient with a suspected rare disease is diagnosed and receives care and available treatment within a year (if their disease is known in the medical literature). One of IRDiRC’s goals is to stimulate the development and approval of 1,000 new therapies for rare diseases by 2027. They appear well on their way to achieving this, with the first steps in their progress (a strategic gap analysis of the rare disease drug development landscape and creation of strategic themes to advance their goal) recently published in the Rare Disease and Orphan Drugs Journal.

Technology is being leveraged across healthcare – from the pandemic-driven access to telemedicine, remote monitoring and implementation of virtual trials, to informatics, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning – and can influence diagnosis and lead to improvements that might have a real benefit to patients’ lives outside of a clinical setting. Advances in this field are significant, and too broad to cover in this article, but a few examples stand out. In 2021, the FDA-funded Rare Disease Cures Accelerator-Data and Analytics Platform (RDCA-DAP®) initiative was launched, providing a centralised and standardised base to host and share de-identified rare disease data and support treatment innovation. RDCA-DAP promotes the sharing of existing patient-level data and encourages the standardisation of new data collection to accelerate the understanding of disease progression (including sources of variability to optimise the characterisation of subpopulations), clinical outcome measures and biomarkers, and facilitate the development of mathematical models of disease and innovative clinical trial design.

Recent advances in genome sequencing have shown the value of data analytics. A pilot study of 4,660 participants published in New Engl J Med (UK 100,000 Genomes Project) highlights the effect of whole genome sequencing on the genetic diagnosis of rare diseases. The study demonstrated an increase in diagnostic yield across rare diseases, with immediate clinical actionability in 25% of those who received a genetic diagnosis.

Two recent publications also illustrate the exciting potential for AI algorithms in supporting diagnosis. The first study, assessing 179 previously diagnosed paediatric cases from six academic medical centres (De La Vega et al. 2021), examined the diagnostic performance of an AI-based gene prioritisation tool (the Fabric GEM AI algorithm). Using medical records to assess patient phenotypes and whole-genome or whole-exome sequencing, the Fabric GEM AI algorithm identified the causative gene as one of its top two candidates >90% of the time. A second example of the diagnostic potential of AI targets the finding that many rare diseases are associated with characteristic facial morphologies (such as Alagille syndrome, a multisystem genetic disease that presents with a range of clinical manifestations, and Angelman syndrome, a genetic syndrome that leads to severe physical and learning disabilities). In a report published in Nature Genetics (Hsieh et al. 2022 ) , photographs of 17,560 patients with 1,115 rare disorders were used to develop a program called GestaltMatcher, which can successfully associate facial dysmorphism with the underlying genetic disorder. Both studies enable substantial automation of disease diagnosis and demonstrate the potential for AI to accelerate clinical diagnosis of patients with rare diseases.

121,121,https://www.sciencenews.org/article/e-coli-viral-grenade-bacteria-dna-toxin-colibactin,Some E. coli set off viral grenades inside nearby bacteria,"Some bacteria can trigger unexploded viral grenades in neighboring bacteria’s DNA.

Certain Escherichia coli bacteria, including some that live in human intestines, make a chemical called colibactin. That chemical awakens dormant viruses inside nearby bacteria, sometimes leading to their destruction, researchers report February 23 in Nature.

This type of biological warfare among bacteria hasn’t been described before. “It’s an interesting strategy, and it’s also a dangerous strategy,” says Heather Hendrickson, an evolutionary microbiologist at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand, who was not involved in the work.

Colibactin producers must creep up on their bacterial enemies and trigger the unexploded ordinance hiding in the enemies’ DNA. Those grenades are prophages — bacteria-infecting viruses that have inserted themselves into their hosts’ DNA, where they hide out harmless and dormant until something triggers their awakening. That something, in this case, is DNA damage caused by colibactin.

When colibactin dings DNA, a bacterial repair system called the SOS response kicks in, chemical biologist Emily Balskus and colleagues found. “What many phages have done is to tap into that response,” says Balskus, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator at Harvard University.

“It’s a signal for them to move out of this dormant lifestyle and awaken to kill their host and move on to find a new host,” she says. Once phages wake up, they replicate and burst out of the host cell, destroying it.

But once these viral grenades go off, they can infect other bacteria, potentially exposing the attacking bacteria and other close-by microbes to biological shrapnel.

Humans might also get caught in the cross fire. Researchers already knew that colibactin can cause damage to human DNA that may lead to colon cancer. But why the bacteria would use the chemical against people wasn’t known.

The new research suggests that E. coli may not be producing colibactin to assault its human hosts, but as a countermeasure against other microbes, Hendrickson says (SN: 12/14/21). “It’s easy to forget that there’s this continual conversation and warfare going on between bacteria, and we might not be the focus of their activities.”

Among bacteria, colibactin isn’t usually a lethal weapon. In most bacteria that Balskus and her colleagues examined, colibactin caused DNA damage, but the bacteria were able to repair the wounds. That may be because colibactin is an unstable chemical that quickly degrades before it can break enough DNA to do irreparable harm, Balskus says. Some bacteria also make other chemicals that defuse colibactin before it can damage DNA, her team found. Only bacteria that have unexploded prophages in their DNA and no other defenses were vulnerable to colibactin-producing bacteria in laboratory dishes.

Because colibactin decays quickly, “it suggests this is a very short-range communication,” says Michael Dougherty, a microbiome researcher at the University of Florida in Gainesville who was not involved in the study. “Maybe it could have an effect when bacteria are forming biofilms where you have trillions of bacteria stacked on top of each other.”

Colibactin may not be the only factor involved in exploding neighboring bacteria, says Dougherty’s University of Florida colleague Christian Jobin. Balskus’ team did not demonstrate that colibactin alone could detonate prophages. Perhaps something else about the colibactin-producing bacterium’s presence is required to kick off the fireworks, he suggests.

The researchers don’t yet know whether colibactin can trigger prophages when bacteria are in their natural habitats, such as human and other animal intestines. And perhaps awakening the viruses is an accident, Balskus speculates.

“Maybe [colibactin] didn’t really evolve to kill. Maybe its primary ecological function involves doing something else,” she says. What that might be is a mystery that Balskus and her colleagues are working to solve.","Certain Escherichia coli bacteria, including some that live in human intestines, make a chemical called colibactin.

The staff made the conclusion in briefing documents ahead of a meeting on Wednesday when a panel of external advisors will discuss whether to recommend accelerated approval of Biogen's drug tofersen for the treatment of a rare genetic form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS. The FDA's accelerated approval designation is meant to allow for faster approval of drugs for serious conditions that fill an unmet medical need.

The panel will examine mixed evidence from the trial related to tofersen's effectiveness and safety, and vote on whether it demonstrates whether the drug will produce a clinical benefit in patients with the rare form of ALS. The FDA typically follows the advice of its advisory committees but is not required to do so.

""This is a situation where there is a negative clinical study that failed to show a statistically significant treatment effect in the prespecified primary analysis population,"" the 68-page staff report says. It notes, however, that the study was limited in its ability to determine whether the drug had any effect on the overall population because of the way it was designed. At the same time, the data indicates that targeted use of the drug was shown to reduce ""a biomarker that has been shown to be correlated with disease progression and prognosis in patients with ALS.""

A separate exploratory analysis of the drug suggests ""a clinical benefit with a longer duration of treatment,"" the staff wrote.

If approved, Biogen's drug could become the first to target a genetic cause of ALS, commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease, which generally affects people between 40 and 70 years old. It's a progressive and fatal neuromuscular disease that causes the nerve cells in the spinal cord and brain to break down over time. It can cause muscles to twitch and cramp, it significantly interferes with motor skills and leads to troubles swallowing, breathing and eventually causes paralysis and death.

The FDA accepted Biogen's application for full approval of tofersen in July. Last October, the agency extended its review of the application by three months. It is slated to make a final decision on April 25.

The FDA's review of tofersen comes as Biogen tries to regain its footing after the polarizing approval and disastrous rollout of its Alzheimer's disease therapy last year. The push to approve tofersen could come with its own hurdles: The drug failed to slow the progression of ALS in a phase three trial, according to results announced in October.

But Biogen noted that the investigational drug had an effect on a mutated version of a protein called SOD1. The protein can accumulate to toxic levels in people with mutations in a specific gene, which can damage the nervous system and lead to the development of ALS.

There are just a few thousand people in the world who have been diagnosed with this type of mutation — roughly 2% of the 168,000 people who have ALS worldwide, according to Biogen. In the U.S., 330 people are affected by the SOD1 mutation. But the drug's approval could herald a new area of promising research in targeting the cause of ALS, which afflicts an estimated 5,000 new people in the U.S. ever year. Researchers from the National Institutes of Health estimate that ALS cases worldwide will increase by nearly 70% to around 376,000.

The trial found that patients who received tofersen saw their SOD1 protein levels decline between 26% and 38% compared with those given a placebo. It also found that tofersen reduced levels of a protein called neurofilament light (NfL,) which is ""correlated with disease severity, disease progression rate, and survival in patients with ALS,"" according to the FDA staff.

The staff highlighted these ""convincing reductions"" found in tofersen's efficacy data, saying ""such a reduction in neuronal damage, as evidenced by reduction in NfL, could be expected to lead to slower clinical functional decline.""

The FDA said it seeks input from the advisory panel on the strength of the efficacy data, and outlined two potential scenarios for the panel to consider. The first is to move forward with recommending accelerated approval based on tofersen's reduction of NfL in ALS patients. The second scenario is recommending full approval of the drug based on the available data and results from an ongoing extension study on tofersen.

The ALS Association earlier this month said it submitted comments to the FDA advisory panel, urging it to recommend full approval of tofersen. The organization noted the drug meets all the requirements for accelerated approval, an FDA designation that allows the agency to approve drugs as rapidly as possible.

""SOD1-linked ALS is a particularly rare and aggressive form of an already rare and devastating disease,"" said Dr. Neil Thakur, The ALS Association's chief mission officer. ""Knowing the urgent need for new ALS treatments and based on the data available at this stage, we believe tofersen meets all the conditions required for accelerated approval: treating a serious condition, providing a meaningful advantage over existing therapies and demonstrating an effect on a surrogate marker that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit.""","U.S. Food and Drug Administration staff on Monday said Biogen's investigational ALS drug may have a ""clinical benefit"" on a rare and aggressive form of the disease, despite failing a broader late-stage clinical trial last year.
A separate exploratory analysis of the drug suggests ""a clinical benefit with a longer duration of treatment,"" the staff wrote.

AAHI held its first Board of Directors meeting this morning.

While operating in Receivership, IDRI made arrangements to satisfy its creditors, reorganized and streamlined its operations, grew its portfolio of innovative formulation and RNA platform technologies, and entered into significant new partnerships to further its nonprofit mission. With the court-approved exit from receivership, all assets and operations are now under AAHI’s control. AAHI will continue with the direction and guidance of its new Board of Directors and executive team on solid financial footing.

AAHI launches with multi-year commitments for over $50 million dollars, including recent licensing agreements with partners such as the prominent immunotherapy company ImmunityBio, Inc. This catalytic funding, together with the Institute’s existing portfolio of government awards, privately sponsored research, and licensing revenue, will allow AAHI to invest in its dedicated team of experts and innovative science to achieve its bold mission. AAHI has refocused and expanded its scientific research and product development to combat some of the world’s deadliest diseases including ongoing work on a next-generation RNA COVID vaccine that promises to be potent, durable, and broadly protective against viral variants. Additional targets for use of AAHI’s immune-stimulating technologies include cancer, allergies, fungal and parasitic infections, and other non-communicable diseases.

Corey Casper, MD, MPH, and CEO of AAHI, said, “We are excited to build upon nearly three decades of extraordinary science, product development, and manufacturing with transformational resources to achieve our renewed mission. AAHI brings together the best experts and latest developments to create solutions for harnessing the power of the immune system to fight disease. Our new name, Access to Advanced Health Institute, reflects our ongoing emphasis on advancing science that enables global equitable access to effective, efficient, broad, and durable vaccines and therapeutics.”

AAHI is committed to solving fundamental scientific challenges that block progress and impede the ability of the biomedical community to deliver on a shared goal – protecting and improving lives and health around the world. AAHI's focus on global availability permeates its efforts to forge new collaborations and partnerships, to train the next generation of scientists to develop and manufacture immune-enhancing technology, and to make immunologic innovations equitably accessible to the people who need them. AAHI’s future plans include leading and supporting developments of a network of satellite institutes initially in South Africa, Botswana, Kenya, Ghana, and Uganda.

AAHI's commitment to science and collaboration has supported development of a COVID vaccine candidate based on AAHI's RNA platform. This self-amplifying RNA COVID vaccine candidate will soon enter ImmunityBio-sponsored Phase I/II clinical trials, expected to begin in the first or second quarter of 2022. AAHI has developed technology that will permit this and other vaccines to be stable at room temperature for over six months.

AAHI is also working with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) DRIVe (Division of Research, Innovation, and Ventures) “Beyond the Needle” Program to develop an RNA vaccine delivered by nasal spray to prevent pandemic influenza. Additionally, the organization has provided adjuvant formulations to stimulate production of broadly neutralizing antibodies to protect against coronavirus variants, a development highlighted by Dr. Anthony Fauci in a White House COVID briefing and published in the journal Nature, “Neutralizing antibody vaccine for pandemic and pre-emergent coronaviruses.”

Patrick Soon-Shiong, MD, Executive Chairman and Global Chief Scientific and Medical Officer of ImmunityBio and the Chair of AAHI’s Board of Directors of AAHI, said, “Ensuring access to healthcare innovations for people everywhere is vital to global health and equity. We can move closer to that goal thanks to the scientific work of AAHI researchers along with AAHI’s ability to turn those discoveries into new therapies in collaboration with our partners in academia, NGOs and industry.”

Glenda Gray, MB Bch, FC Paeds, DSc (hc), OMS, President and CEO of the South African Medical Research Council, said, “Access to innovative vaccines and immunotherapies is a critical part of reducing the global health burden. The work of the AAHI and its researchers is important for building research capacity and manufacturing medical products in Africa.”

For nearly three decades, AAHI and its predecessor, IDRI, have focused on creating immune-enhancing technologies that improve the body’s natural response to disease. AAHI has responded to the complex issues surrounding global access to vaccines and other life-changing technologies by reassessing and refocusing its efforts to ensure that its pioneering immune-enhancing platform technologies can be more rapidly and efficiently used in areas of greatest need—regardless of geography or socio-economic status. AAHI is looking forward to future delivery on its mission - building a world in which every person has access to the tools that harness their immune systems and allow for a long, healthy life.

The father, who also has a 26-year-old son, a software engineer who has moved closer to his workplace, said: “On top of the frequent meltdowns, the first few months were especially sad as Farrel would try to hug and kiss women we saw outside because he thought they were his mother.

“It was hard whenever we went out and saw a family.”

This eventually stopped, but exhaustion continued to mount as the 55-year-old safety officer cooked for the family to save on food expenses.

He also does the household chores, which include bathing his younger son every day.

“Thankfully, my employer allows me to work part-time for about half of my former salary, which means that I can look after Farrel’s needs when he comes back from school,” Mr Yusman said.

But his worries were compounded when one of his daughters started struggling mentally during the divorce proceedings. The two girls, aged 23 and 24, are undergraduates.

“There were many times when the pressure and stress really drove me to the edge,” Mr Yusman said, adding that he would have suicidal thoughts.

Overwhelmed, he looked on the Internet for ways to manage his stress and came across CaringSG, a support network for caregivers of children with special needs and disabilities.

He is among 26 caregivers of people with disabilities and special needs – such as global developmental delay – who were befriended through the network. CaringSG is a caregiver-led charity which began in July 2021.

Mr Yusman was paired with Mr Lim Chin Teong through CaringSG’s Carebuddy peer support initiative.

Mr Lim, a 41-year-old father of one, is keen to help tide other men over the kind of distress he experienced himself when his son was diagnosed with autism at age two. The boy is now seven years old.

The IT auditor said: “I had an idea of what it would be like to have a son, playing football or having long conversations over a beer when he was older, but life doesn’t always turn out the way you think it would.

“I remember the nights after learning about my son’s autism... just spiralling into despair.”","“It was hard whenever we went out and saw a family.”This eventually stopped, but exhaustion continued to mount as the 55-year-old safety officer cooked for the family to save on food expenses.

Yi Zhou, from the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, and colleagues examined the association between depression and the severity of DED symptoms and signs, including inflammatory markers in a secondary cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis of data from the Dry Eye Assessment and Management study, involving patients with moderate-to-severe symptoms and signs of DED. A total of 535 patients from 27 ophthalmology and optometry centers were followed for one year.

The researchers found that patients who screened positive for depression had worse DED symptoms based on the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) and Brief Ocular Discomfort Index and composite DED sign score. Worse depression, as indicated by a lower Mental Component Summary score on the 36-item Short Form Health Survey, was associated with a higher OSDI score (worse symptoms) at baseline, six months, and 12 months. No difference was seen in inflammatory markers by depression status.

""Identifying depression and considering treatment, including systemic medications, may be useful in managing patients with DED,"" the authors write. ""Patients with more severe DED concerns or sign measurements may benefit from comorbid psychiatric screening.""

The seminal contributions made by Drs. Fischer and Alzheimer still provide the underpinnings for the current nosology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) [1,2,3,4]. Both scientists documented the core pathological features of the postmortem AD brain – senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), neuronal loss and gliosis. The presence of these changes in the cortex and hippocampus upon neuropathological examination was associated with a progressive amnestic dementia and decline in other higher order cognitive functions prior to death. Indeed, AD could equally be called Fischer’s disease or perhaps plaque and tangle dementia, but as elegantly discussed by others, political factors and scientific rivalries led to naming this form of dementia AD [5,6,7,8].

AD is the most common form of dementia among the elderly, accounting for ~ 70% of all dementias in those over 60 [9]. Currently, worldwide, ~ 40 million individuals are affected by AD, a number that will grow to over 100 million by 2050. Estimates of AD prevalence vary based on the population studied and criteria used to clinically define the disease, but all studies show increased prevalence with increasing age. For example, in the US a 2010 study showed a prevalence of 3% among those 65–74, 17% of those age 75–84 and 32% for those 85 years and older [9, 10]. Thus, with increased life span comes an increased risk for developing AD.

AD typically manifests with short-term semantic memory problems but progresses to alter many higher order cognitive functions. Other cognitive and behavioral disturbances are common, but variable, features, which can present during disease progression. These features include, but are not limited to depression, anxiety, irritability, apathy, euphoria, disinhibition, psychosis, agitation, aggression, aberrant motor activities, sleep disturbance, and eating disorders. On average individuals live for ~ 7 years with AD, but some progress more rapidly and others much more slowly [9]. Ultimately, those affected with AD die because of complications of the disease often related to infections such as pneumonia. Given the slow progression and its prevalence, AD extracts a huge personal, societal, and economic toll – a toll that will dramatically increase in the coming decades if highly effective interventions are not developed. Indeed, monetization of the impact of AD indicates that it costs the US ~ $300 billion dollars a year [9].

Our understanding of AD and other forms of dementia has evolved significantly since its initial neuropathological description in the early 1900s. In the 1980s, AD entered the “molecular age” when a small neuropeptide called the amyloid β protein (Aβ) was found to be the key fibrillar component of senile plaques [11,12,13,14] and the microtubule binding protein tau to be the key fibrillar component of NFTs [15, 16]. We also now recognize i) that based on clinical symptoms many forms of dementia can be difficult to distinguish from AD and ii) the long prodromal phases of AD reflect an underlying pathological disease process long before overt clinical symptoms appear [17, 18]. Clinical neuropathological correlations demonstrate that AD does not always present with the classic amnestic syndrome characterized by early defects in episodic memory (reviewed in [19]). Pathological subtypes of AD such as hippocampal sparing AD and posterior cortical atrophy can be associated with clinical symptoms more commonly linked to frontal temporal dementia or prion disease. Moreover, “pure” AD defined by only plaques and tangle pathology is rare in those over 80. Other pathologies such as TDP-43 inclusions, hippocampal sclerosis, α-synuclein in Lewy Bodies and Lewy Neurites and vascular changes are often, but variably, present [19].

The advances that have helped us refine our nosology of AD are not always reflected in our interpretation of prior data. Past studies of dementia in the elderly that have relied on clinical diagnosis are confounded by the classification of non-AD dementia as AD and, if assessing cohorts in the very early stages of dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI), often included many individuals without overt neuropathology. Further, a significant percentage of elderly controls will have varying degrees of underlying AD pathologies [20,21,22,23,24]. Indeed, confounds are caused both by misclassification i) of non-AD dementias as AD and ii) and non-demented controls who are in some preclinical stage of AD. These confounds should be considered in our interpretation of prior studies that rely solely on the clinical diagnosis of AD or MCI. Armed with both imaging and emerging blood-based biomarkers, we now can conduct rigorous clinical studies in living humans by more accurately diagnosing AD and AD pathologies even in those without overt symptoms.

Towards a comprehensive theory of AD

Any comprehensive theory of AD must be able to account for many disparate observations and also be able to distinguish between the relatively rare evidence that points to causality versus the common evidence that provides simple association with disease. To have face validity, a theory must be able to account for both more settled scientific aspects of the disease and provide plausible insights into areas of the pathological cascade that are more controversial. Here, I provide a modern rigorous conceptualization of AD conveyed as a hypothetical lifelong journey of human brain from a healthy state into organ failure (Fig. 1). Though AD is conceptualized as a disease of aging, and advancing age is irrefutably the major demographic risk factor for AD, processes underlying AD are present in the developing brain and persist throughout the life span. These data build off the long-standing amyloid cascade hypothesis (ACH) [25, 26], but acknowledge that the linear cascade proposed in the ACH is far more complex than originally thought [27].

Fig. 1 The lifelong journey of a healthy brain into AD and brain organ failure. The factors that contribute to the development, and alter risk for, AD are depicted below a hypothetical lifespan of someone who gets symptomatic AD at 80 years of age. The blue coloring indicates the time and strength of those factors that are active or emerge variably during the lifespan. Pathology onset begins some 25–30 years before symptoms emerge and shows a characteristic sequence of changes beginning with Aβ deposition followed by cellular dysfunction, tau pathology and neurodegeneration. Age related co-morbidities can have increasing impact on disease course in late life.

Genes set the stage

AD has a strong heritable component [9, 28,29,30]. Epidemiologic studies, including monozygotic twin studies, show that the heritability of AD is at least 50%. Having a parent or sibling with AD increases risk, and those with more than one first-degree relative are at even higher risk. Thus, genetics plays a major role in risk for developing AD. The field has now catalogued, at least in Caucasians of European decent, i) genetic alterations that deterministically cause familial AD, ii) the more common genetic variants that alter risk for AD, and iii) the relatively rare variants with MAF of ~ 0.01 that reproducibly associate with altered AD risk (Fig. 2) [31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42]. Rare variants with minor allele frequency (MAF) less than 0.01 that alter risk for AD are still being identified, though the low frequency of these variants in the population often means that validation of the variant with AD risk will take some time. Well-powered, genetic, biomarker and autopsy studies will be needed to confirm the genetic association and to show that the association is truly linked to biomarker or pathologically verified AD. In the current genome wide association studies (GWAS) that rely on a clinical diagnosis of AD, potential inclusion of non-AD dementing syndromes might mean that some risk loci identified are not really AD loci but loci for other forms of dementia. In this light, a very recent AD GWAS of over a million individuals identifies both GRN and TM106b as AD risk genes, whether this represents true genetic pleiotropy or simply inclusion of sufficient FTD-GRN cases misclassified as AD will require further study [43].

Extremely rare variants in the amyloid β precursor protein (APP) or Presenilin 1 (PSEN1) or 2 (PSEN2) genes can cause autosomal dominant AD, which usually presents as early-onset AD (EOAD) [44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58]. Symptoms usually manifest within these families between the ages of 40–60. Of great relevance, a rare variant in the APP gene has been shown to protect from AD in Icelanders [59]. In contrast to these rare AD-linked mutations in APP and PSEN1/2, the APOE gene confers a large population attributable risk for AD. The APOE4 allele is associated with increased risk and the APOE2 allele protection from AD [40, 41]. Both APOE2 and APOE4 alleles alter risk in dose dependent fashion; the presence of one allele confers a moderate risk or protection but the presence of two alleles confers even stronger risk or protection. Indeed, given that AD is a common disorder, the ~ tenfold risk attributable to a homozygous E4/E4 genotype verges on causality, whereas the even rarer E2/E2 genotype results in almost complete protection [60, 61]. More recently homozygosity of a rare variant in APOE, referred to as the Christchurch variant (R136S) was associated with long lasting protection from symptoms of AD in a single-carrier of the early-onset familial AD (EOFAD)-linked PSEN1 E280G variant [62]. In contrast a heterozygous carrier of this same variant developed clinical symptoms of early AD at 53 years and died at 72 years of age [63]. Postmortem analysis showed classic features of Alzheimer’s disease. Other rare variants in APOE also confer protection, though such findings need broader replication [64]. Undeniably, such studies highlight the challenges of making broad inferences about causality or protection from what are essentially case-reports.

The biologic basis of genetic risk – the life-long impact of genetic variance

In the absence of effective proven disease modifying therapies or faithful animal models that fully recapitulate the human disease, genetic studies serve as the only truly validated guideposts for inferring causality (Fig. 2). Study of these rare genetic forms of AD have provided the framework for the ACH and our current understanding of AD at least with respect to the initial causal triggers of disease [26, 65]. Biomarker, modeling, biophysical and pathological studies all show that mutations in APP or PSEN1/2 associated with early onset Familial AD (EOFAD) result in changes to APP processing or Aβ itself, in a way that promotes Aβ aggregation. (Fig. 3). They do so in three distinct ways: i) increasing total Aβ production [45, 66,67,68,69], ii) increasing the relative production of long Aβ peptides (typically Aβ42 but sometimes Aβ43) [70,71,72,73,74] or iii) altering the sequence of Aβ itself in a way that promotes its aggregation [44, 75,76,77]. In contrast, the protective variant in APP found in Iceland is associated with decreased Aβ production [59], and confers life-long protection from AD and cognitive decline. These findings serve as the fundamental observation that supports the ACH, which in its simplest form posits that Aβ aggregation, as amyloid, is the initiating event in AD.

Fig. 3 Functional impact of genes linked to AD or risk for AD. Pivotal support for the ACH comes from genetic pathological, biomarker and experimental studies that link genes that cause EOFAD or alter risk for AD to Aβ aggregation and accumulation. Mutants and variants that increase risk alter Aβ in a manner that promotes deposition as amyloid. Conversely other variants appear to decrease the likelihood of Aβ aggregation and accumulation. AD genes, enriched in microglial cells, may modulate Aβ deposition, responses to aggregated Aβ or tau pathology, or both. Mutations in tau associated with FTD reinforce the notion that tau aggregation and accumulation is an important feature of AD Full size image

Notably, these mutations appear to cause life-long changes in Aβ production or clearance. However, the accumulation of Aβ is still quite gradual typically preceding onset of symptoms by at least 20–30 years [18, 78]. Timing of accumulation appears to be primarily determined by both the total Aβ level, the relative level of Aβ42 (or in some cases both Aβ42 and Aβ43) and APOE genotype [79]. Both autopsy and imaging studies show that APOE4 leads to earlier onset of Aβ deposition and typically results in higher levels of Aβ deposited, whereas APOE2 delays onset of deposition [61, 80,81,82,83,84]. This difference translates into the clinical setting where APOE4 carriers typically show increased incidence of AD and an early onset of symptoms compared to those with APOE3 alleles whereas APOE2 carriers show reduced incidence of AD and delayed onset [85,86,87,88,89,90,91,92].

Aβ is produced from APP constitutively through the combined action of the aspartyl proteases β-secretase (BACE1) and γ-secretase [93,94,95,96,97,98]. PSEN1/2 serve as the catalytic component of the multi-subunit γ-secretase complex [99,100,101,102,103,104,105,106]. This sequential processing produces a complex set of Aβ peptides with variable amino and carboxyl termini [107]. Thus, Aβ is best referred to as a ~ 4 kDa peptide [108]. In vitro “Long” Aβx-42(43) species aggregate much more rapidly than shorter Aβ peptides (e.g., Aβx-38, x-40) [109,110,111], and this is reflected by the early and preferential accumulation of Aβx-42 in humans [112, 113]. In the absence of mutations in the Aβ peptide sequence itself, the longer Aβ species appear to be required for deposition of Aβ in vivo [114, 115]. Curiously, in humans, most mutations within the Aβ peptide sequence that alter its aggregation properties variably cause AD, severe congophilic amyloid angiopathy (CAA), or some combination of the two. CAA caused by Aβ typically shows Aβ40 preferentially accumulating in the leptomeningeal arteries and cortical arterioles [44, 75, 112, 116, 117]. CAA is the predominant feature in the autosomal dominant disorder Hereditary Cerebral Hemorrhage with Amyloidosis Dutch type (HCHWA-D) linked to mutations at position 693 of APP, which clinically presents with cortical hemorrhagic stroke. However, amyloid deposition in the brain parenchyma is present and likely contributes to disease progression in HCHWA-D. CAA due to Aβ is also a common feature of AD, and small cortical hemorrhages associated with CAA may contribute to the cognitive phenotype in AD. In the general population, large bleeds due to CAA that contribute significantly to functional decline are rare, but do occur. These bleeds can often confound clinical diagnoses in the absence of imaging studies. However, though CAA may play some role in the overall phenotype, it still is important to note that fulminant AD can occur without appreciable CAA [117].

There is compelling data from model systems that select EOAD-linked APP and PSEN mutant may alter cellular functions such as endosomal, autophagic and lysosomal trafficking [118,119,120]. These effects in some cases appear to be independent of effects on APP processing and subsequent alterations in Aβ [121]. There are other GWAS loci implicated in endosomal trafficking [32]. However, direct links between these alterations associated with variants in APP, PSEN, and GWAS loci and AD pathophysiology remain somewhat uncertain. More generally, there is limited data regarding the link between AD genetic risk loci identified in GWAS and the alteration in function that contributes to AD pathogenesis. Imputation of biological function of genes implicated by GWAS do point to immune system, lipid metabolism, tau-binding proteins, and APP metabolism [31, 122]. However, for most associations imputations to biological function remain speculative. As the risk associated with most GWAS loci is small, it may prove very challenging to home in on the biological basis for the genetic risk.

As the most abundant lipoprotein in the brain, APOE is linked to numerous biological functions related to its role in lipid transport [123, 124]. However, APOE is intimately linked to Aβ pathophysiology in an isoform dependent fashion that is consistent with the isoform-associated impact on AD risk. In humans, APOE co-deposits with Aβ in cores of plaques. In autopsy studies, the APOE4 allele is associated with increased parenchymal and vascular amyloid deposition, whereas the APOE2 allele is associated with less amyloid deposition. In amyloid PET ligand imaging studies, APOE4 is associated with increased amyloid ligand binding and an earlier average age of onset of detectable ligand binding, whereas APOE2 showed the opposite effect, delaying average age of onset and reducing amount of ligand accumulation [123]. Differences in biological impact of APOE isoforms has also been noted with respect to lipid metabolism, immune cell function, cardiovascular health, and even to tauopathy in mouse models [123,124,125,126]. However, it remains unclear whether these are major contributors to the isoform-dependent alterations in risk for AD conferred by APOE. APOE and other genetic alterations linked to AD have early life effects that are related to their normal biological functions. For example, APOE genotype has been linked to hippocampal volume and myelination alterations in infants and pediatric populations [125, 127]. However, these subtle alterations do not impart major effects on cognitive abilities or have other effects on brain and cognitive phenotypes.

Both immune loci implicated by GWAS and rare variants in TREM2, ABI3 and PLCG2 are thought to alter AD risk by influencing microglial or more broadly immune function [33, 38, 58]. Although far from settled science, study of the functional variants in TREM2 and PLCG2 suggest that increased microglial activation mediated by these proteins is protective from AD [128,129,130,131,132,133,134]. As discussed later, the impact of immune system on AD pathogenesis likely occurs later in life as the proteinopathies emerge. Of note, Dr. Fischer presciently, postulated that plaques might represent some sort of pathogen and that the glial response might contribute to disease progression. Indeed, the notion that infection, such as herpes virus, may play a causal role in AD, continues to find some traction the field. However, this infectious origin of AD hypothesis remains controversial and is largely based on less than convincing epidemiologic association studies [135]. Indeed, it is more widely accepted that Aβ aggregates are danger-associated molecular patterns that potently activate the immune system similar to an exogenous foreign pathogen [130, 136].

Early life brain development, educational attainment and risk for AD

Both educational attainment and intelligence are among select factors reproducibly associated with altered risk for late life dementia and AD [10] (Fig. 1). These observations have provided foundational support for the concept of cognitive and brain reserve [137, 138]. As with most epidemiologic associations, detailed mechanistic insight into the biology underlying the risk is lacking, but the general concepts are quite simple. If one has a more “fit” brain that is nurtured during development and early life then it is capable of withstanding more damage later in life. Alternatively, one could propose early brain development creates a more fit brain that actually alters the risk for development of AD pathologies later in life. Current data more strongly supports the notion that these early life factors do not alter the presence of pathology, but the ability to retain cognitive function despite damage to the brain [137, 138]. The biological factors that underlie reserve are speculative. The field has conceptualized reserve into two main categories: brain reserve, which refers to brain structure changes that may increase tolerance to pathology, and cognitive reserve, which refers to individual differences in how tasks are performed that might enable some people to be more resilient to brain changes than others [138]. Developmental processes that lead to a more resilient brain structure and inherent attributes that could relate to synaptic and neuronal plasticity could contribute to both forms of reserve. As intelligence is highly heritable, it is not surprising that negative correlations between genetic variants that are associated with higher measures of intelligence and AD have been reported. However, there is no tight functional link between variants that associate with intelligence levels and those that associate with AD [139].

Lifestyle and co-morbidities influence cognitive trajectories

Numerous epidemiologic studies have now shown that a healthy diet, physical exercise, reduction of cardiovascular and metabolic disease risk factors and control of hypertension are associated, at the population level, with modest reductions in risk for dementia in later life [140,141,142,143,144,145,146,147,148,149]. The biological factors that underpin these associations are not well established and are likely to be highly complex and heterogeneous in nature. Here it is important to distinguish between the broader umbrella of late onset dementia and cognitive impairment that is assessed in these studies versus AD dementia. These “lifestyle” factors clearly impact cardiovascular and vascular health, and many believe that beneficial effects of these various factors are mediated through improved vascular health. Thus, the associations may be more reflective of the co-morbid conditions that contribute to brain reserve or fitness, rather than directly impacting AD pathophysiology (Fig. 1). Of course, there are studies in model systems that suggest that factors such as diet and diabetes could more directly impact AD pathologies, but these have not been widely replicated and the effects sizes of these manipulations are relatively modest.

Whether viewing these associations from an individual or public health perspective, it is sensible to encourage individuals who are worried about dementia in later life to adopt lifestyle changes that evidence suggests should support future protection from dementia. Indeed, beneficial lifestyle changes have many overall health benefits. The challenge here is one of implementation. How do we get individuals to adopt such lifestyle changes? Efforts to understand the factors that mediate these beneficial effects, and the mechanisms through which lifestyle changes alter physiology to promote healthy brain aging, are laudable. However, it is likely that the underlying biologic impact of these lifestyle factors is multilayered and multifactorial.

Other factors such as stress, depression, sleep alterations and traumatic brain injury (TBI) have been associated with an increased risk for dementia later in life [150,151,152,153,154,155,156]. Whether these are truly risk factors for AD remain somewhat uncertain, as these studies rely solely on a clinical diagnosis of “AD”, which as noted above cannot precisely distinguish AD from other forms of dementia. Indeed, TBI is much more consistently associated with a post-mortem diagnosis of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) [157,158,159,160]. CTE is primarily considered a tauopathy and has distinct spatiotemporal distribution of tau compared to AD. However, for stress there is strong preclinical biology indicating that dysfunction of the hypothalamic pituitary axis may accelerate both amyloid and tau pathologies and possibly even hippocampal neurodegeneration [150]. Other behavioral alterations such as disrupted sleep have also been demonstrated to alter Aβ production, accumulation, efflux from the brain or some combination of these effects [161, 162]. Thus, one could envision how depression and other chronic stress conditions that often disrupt sleep could contribute to risk for future AD. Nevertheless, as the pathophysiology of AD begins long before symptoms appear, another concern with many of these retrospective epidemiologic studies is whether the associations reflect a true prodromal risk or are actually early subtle signs of pathological changes in the brain. In any case, non‐genetic factors may be more amenable to intervention than heritable aspects of AD, especially if such interventions are non-pharmacologic in nature and safe. Therefore, even though it is challenging, it is important to establish more definitively what non‐genetic factors contribute to AD risk and the biological basis for that risk.

The long, clinically silent, phase of AD pathology development

Over the last 20 years, there have been remarkable advances in our ability to image AD pathologies and structural changes in the brains of living patients, and in many cases to do so longitudinally. PET ligands can now detect amyloid and tau pathologies [163,164,165,166,167,168,169,170]. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging can evaluate brain volumetric changes and alterations in brain connectivity in AD [165, 171]. More recently, advances in blood biomarkers that accurately predict underlying AD pathologies, even in the absence of symptoms, portends a new era where simple laboratory tests may provide substantive insight into the status of the brain with respect to underlying AD pathologies [172,173,174,175,176,177,178,179,180,181]. All of these blood-based biomarkers were initially developed and validated in studies using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), but technological advances enabled current serum or plasma assays [18, 165]. Indeed, decreased Aβ42:40 levels and increases in select phosphorylated tau epitopes are associated with amyloid PET ligand positivity even in asymptomatic stages. Neurofilament light chain (NFL) elevations correlate with neurodegenerative findings on MRI and in some cases progression of symptoms or rate of progression to symptoms. Glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) increases are associated with astrogliosis. NFL and GFAP are not specific for AD, but in the setting of evidence for amyloid deposition, they add vital information about the stage of disease.

These biomarker studies now consistently show that twenty or more years before one develops symptoms of AD, Aβ begins to accumulate as amyloid in the brain [182,183,184] (Fig. 1). For many years, this gradual deposition appears, at least at the level of cognitive function, to have relatively little impact. Though some cognitive “stress tests” may be able to detect subtle changes in cognition in these individuals, exactly when those changes occur and how consistent they are remains under investigation [185]. Indeed, it is only after a decade or more of ongoing progressive accumulation of Aβ that signs of neurodegeneration appear, and along with these signs, evidence of impaired brain function. However, even at this stage of disease, functional and cognitive changes are still not enough to fall out of the normal range. Tau pathology of sufficient magnitude to be detected by PET imaging appears to begin coincident with the onset of neurodegeneration detected by volumetric brain loss on structural MRI imaging. The timing of glial, vascular and synaptic changes within this framework remains less clear, but most studies would suggest that such changes are roughly coincident with the transition from an amyloid only state to an amyloid plus neurodegeneration state.

Cross-sectional studies of postmortem human brains enabled scientists to infer the pathological sequencing now seen in virtually every presentation of biomarker studies of AD. Indeed, Braak and Thal staging of tangle and amyloid pathology, respectively, were well established staging frameworks for AD based on post-mortem studies [186, 187]. However, until modern imaging and biomarker studies enabled robust studies in living humans, these postmortem findings were interpreted in very different ways. Some argued that the presence of Aβ in individuals who died with normal cognition meant that Aβ accumulation did not play a causal role in the disease, and could even be protective [188,189,190]. Given data in hand in the 1980s, this postulate was reasonable. However, as the biological underpinnings of genetic forms of AD emerged in the 1990s and consistently pointed to Aβ accumulation as an early triggering event, the concept that Aβ deposition was benign became less tenable. Notably, the lack of definitive mechanistic insight into how Aβ accumulation triggers the neurodegenerative phase of the disease strongly suggest that though amyloid is necessary to trigger AD it is not sufficient (Fig. 4). It remains plausible that plaque formation is an acutely adaptive response that is initially protective but over time turns toxic. There are certainly many precedents for acutely adaptive biological responses in humans that later result in toxicities.

Fig. 4 Enigmatic aspects of the ACH. This schematic illustrates some of the gaps in our knowledge regarding certain aspects of the ACH. Uncertainty remains about how Aβ aggregate accumulation drives downstream changes. Similarly, there is uncertainty regarding how tau accumulation leads to neurodegeneration. It is likely that the mechanism that link Aβ and tau together and to neurodegeneration are complex. One concept that is not commonly discussed is that the presence of either amyloid or tau pathology and both pathological and compensatory response may make the brain more vulnerable to additional insults. Such vulnerability might explain why clinical progression is so variable, and how co-morbidities may impact the clinical phase of disease Full size image

Neurodegenerative changes occur during this prodromal silent phase of disease. However, there is individual variability in time between onset of degeneration and symptomatology that triggers a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment or dementia [165]. Studies in EOFAD as well as some other longitudinal cohort studies do show that as signs of neurodegeneration emerge there are associated changes in cognitive function. In most cases, these changes would not be sufficient to recognize that the individual has some sort of cognitive impairment. Rather, they simply demonstrate a change from an individual’s baseline cognitive status. Again, brain and cognitive reserve likely play a major role in determining how much damage an individual brain can tolerate before symptoms become overt. Individuals with high reserve may tolerate much higher levels of pathology and neurodegeneration before showing symptoms, and those with lower reserve may show symptoms sooner [137].

Symptomatic phase of disease – progression from early to late brain organ failure

Once neurodegeneration begins, there is variable, yet inexorable, progression towards symptomatology that is clinically recognized as abnormal. Within the brain, this is attributed to ongoing neuronal and synaptic loss, spread of tau pathology, and alterations in the cellular function of non-neuronal cells [165]. As this pathology advances, so do the symptoms. Subjective memory complaints may be a very early sign of something wrong, but have indeterminate predictive value. Often the spouse or caregiver notes the individual has shown some cognitive alterations for years before presenting to a clinician. Consistent or increasing concern about cognition may lead to clinical assessments and diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). An individual with MCI often complains of forgetfulness, losing their train of thought, having difficulty with decision making and having trouble navigating their environment. A spouse or caregiver may report that they are more impulsive and showing poor judgment. Signs and symptom of depression, irritability, anxiety, and apathy may also be present. Of not","Fischer and Alzheimer still provide the underpinnings for the current nosology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) [1,2,3,4].
Both scientists documented the core pathological features of the postmortem AD brain – senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), neuronal loss and gliosis.

Previously, several studies have suggested that NAFLD was an independent risk factor affecting cardiac structure and function, but there are few studies on the correlation between non-obese NAFLD and LV function or structure in Chinese adults. Therefore, this paper studied the changes of LV structure and function in hospitalized non-obese NAFLD patients, and discussed the correlation between non-obese NAFLD and LV diastolic dysfunction, aiming to provide scientific evidence for clinicians to pay attention to the cardiac structure and function of non-obese NAFLD patients.

Our study showed that compared with the control group, non-obese NAFLD patients had higher BMI, BSA, levels of liver enzymes, blood lipids, proportion of DM, and worse glucose metabolism, which were consistent with previous reports. Although BMI of a non-obese NAFLD patient is within the normal range, it is still higher than that of a healthy adult and the visceral fat index is also high [13, 29]. Obesity is related to higher all-cause mortality [30], so both obese and non-obese NAFLD patients can benefit from losing weight [31]. For non-obese NAFLD patients, a 5–10% reduction in body weight through lifestyle intervention may be a reasonable target and can also benefit them a lot [32]. There are also many drugs as good candidates to cure NAFLD/NASH, and consequently to reduce the burden of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) [33].

In this study, LV structure and function were mainly evaluated by echocardiographic parameters, among which E/A ratio and E value were important indices to evaluate LV diastolic function. In the early stage of LV diastolic dysfunction, the E value declines due to the decrease of the maximum mitral blood flow velocity in the early LV diastole, which leads to E/A < 1 [34]. With the further decline of LV diastolic function, the reduction in diastolic LV filling results in an atrial residuum, which increases left atrial (LA) pressure, causing an increase of E value. Finally, the increased load imposed on the LA as a result of a poorly compliant LV may lead to decreased atrial contractile reserve, LA enlargement, and a decrease of A value. The combined effects of a rise in E value and a decrease in A value result in an increase of E/A [28].

We compared the LV structure and function indices between non-obese NAFLD group and control group, and the results showed that non-obese NAFLD patients had lower E/A while there was no significant statistical difference in proportions of LV diastolic dysfunction. The reason why we considered the result may be that decreased E/A or declined function in non-obese NAFLD patients was at an extremely early stage so that had not yet reached the diagnostic standard of LV diastolic dysfunction. Then in addition to diastolic dysfunction, we also analyzed E/A < 1 as a dependent variable. The results of this study showed that in non-obese people, subjects with NAFLD had a 6.6-fold increased risk for decrease of E/A while non-obese NAFLD was not an independent risk factor of LV diastolic dysfunction.

Maybe the above results were still controversial because there are few similar studies about non-obese NAFLD at present. A previous research showed that non-obese NAFLD patients have worse echocardiographic measurements, including IVSd, LVEDD, LVPWd, EF, LVM and E velocity [35]. Most studies about NAFLD, whether the patient was obese or not, showed that NAFLD patients had worse cardiac structure and function [21, 36,37,38,39,40,41], even related to the degree of liver fibrosis [42]. And latest research revealed that LVMI increased progressively and LV diastolic function worsened with increasing number of steatosis scores in NAFLD patients. It also showed that liver steatosis, as identified by use of biochemical scores, predicted LV hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction independently of blood pressure and obesity, and this association was independent of the HOMA-index for LV diastolic dysfunction [43]. Then there was a research showing that metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease patients had increased interventricular septum thickness, left ventricular posterior wall thickness, LVM and LVMI, and more patients with MAFLD had LV diastolic dysfunction compared to the normal group (60.8% vs 24.6%, p < 0.001).

On the contrary, some studies believed that correlation between NAFLD and cardiac function remained to be confirmed because of confounding factors such as obesity [44, 45]. A previous Chinese cohort study revealed that no significant association was observed between non-obese NAFLD and incident coronary artery disease after adjusting other traditional cardiovascular risk factors [46].

Surprisingly, non-obese NAFLD patients have smaller LVEDD, which is usually found in late stage of LV diastolic dysfunction. We consider this result probably because non-obese NAFLD patients had more complications or some medication history leading to abnormal ventricular structure. Moreover, despite the exclusion of all patients with known heart disease, there may be patients with asymptomatic coronary heart disease even if all echocardiographic results showed no abnormal wall motion. Both multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that age and BMI were independent risk factors of LV diastolic dysfunction or E/A decrease, which was consistent with previous consensus that age and BMI are independent risk factors of CVD.

Non-obese NAFLD is similar to obese NAFLD in pathophysiology and non-obese NAFLD individuals seem to have an intermediate metabolic phenotype between healthy individuals and obese NAFLD patients.

A previous study based on liver biopsy showed that compared with obese NAFLD patients, non-obese NAFLD patients had lighter degree of hepatocytic steatosis, lobular inflammation and advanced liver fibrosis, and lower prevalence of NASH (54.1% vs 71.2%, p < 0.001) [47], and it also believed that liver fibrosis in non-obese NAFLD patients was obviously related to metabolic disorders. Another meta-analysis including 493 non-obese NAFLD patients and 2209 obese NAFLD patients compared the liver histological features between the two groups, which also showed that pathological changes of non-obese NAFLD were mild [48]. Insulin resistance is universal in NAFLD patients whether they are obese or not [12, 49, 50]. Non-obese NAFLD patients generally had higher prevalence of DM and glucose intolerance than healthy subjects, while there was no statistical difference between non-obese and obese NAFLD patients [51]. The changes of intestinal microbiota are also associated with the progress of NAFLD and liver fibrosis [52, 53]. A previous report about gut microbiota composition showed that Eubacterium abundance was significantly decreased in non-obese NAFLD patients compared with that in obese NAFLD patients and healthy subjects, then the results demonstrated a negative correlation between Eubacterium and hepatic fibrosis and that the decrease in the abundance of Eubacterium producing butyric acid may play an important role in the development of non-obese NAFLD [54]. It was found that a variety of gene sites are related to the risk, disease severity, hepatic steatosis and advanced fibrosis of NAFLD, including PNPLA3, TM6SF2, GCKR, MBOAT7, APOC3, HSD17B13, etc. [55,56,57,58,59,60]. Among them, PNPLA3 is one of the earliest genes related to NAFLD in genome-wide association studies. the PNPLA3 rs738409 GG genotype was found in 13–19% of the general population in Asian, which is higher than that in other regions [12]. PNPLA3 not only plays a role in increasing the susceptibility to NAFLD, but also is related to abdominal visceral fat accumulation [61], and this gene has been proved to be one of the risk factors for NAFLD in non-obese people [62]. TM6SF2 has a protective effect on cardiovascular system, but it participates in hepatic steatosis and increases the susceptibility to NASH and hepatic fibrosis [63]. Compared with obese NAFLD patients, TM6SF2 E167K mutation is more common in non-obese NAFLD patients [64]. A new study found that loss of immunity-related GTPase GM4951 leads to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease without obesity [65]. At present, it is considered that NAFLD is not only related to systemic insulin resistance, but also related to endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, plaque formation, vascular tone change, systemic inflammatory response, metabolic disorders of blood lipid and so on [66,67,68]. Previous studies have shown that compared with healthy people, non-obese NAFLD patients also have a higher risk of coronary heart disease [69], and there is no statistical difference between non-obese NAFLD patients and obese NAFLD patients in the risk of CVD and malignant tumors, and they all have a higher risk of all-cause mortality [65]. The main causes of death of non-obese NAFLD patients are malignant tumors and CVD [70].

Despite the fact that NAFLD is usually associated with obesity, it has also been noted that the prevalence of NAFLD is increasing in non-obese individuals. Non-obese NAFLD is similar to the obese NAFLD in pathophysiological mechanism and influence on other related diseases. Compared with the healthy individuals, the non-obese NAFLD patients have a higher risk of liver cirrhosis, hypertension, DM, coronary heart disease and other diseases, as well as the risk of all-cause death, which needs to be confirmed by more studies in the future.

The research is meaningful for clinicians and patients because it can remind clinicians to pay more attention to cardiac structure and function of non-obese NAFLD patients, and early intervention on non-obese NAFLD to delay its progress may be helpful to prevent myocardial dysfunction.

However, this study has several limitations. First, the cross-sectional design of this study was difficult to explore the causal relationship between NAFLD and LV diastolic dysfunction. Second, imaging examination were used to diagnose NAFLD and we were unable to obtain liver histological samples, the gold standard for the diagnosis of NAFLD. Third, data on visceral adiposity, such as waist circumference, was lacking. Forth, despite the exclusion of all patients with known heart disease, the further research may need the coronary angiography as the diagnostic gold standard to exclude patients with asymptomatic coronary heart disease. Fifth,we used E/A and E value to evaluate LV diastolic dysfunction, while only this approach is difficult to identify patients with Grade 2 diastolic dysfunction (pseudonormal filling pattern) when E/A is in the normal range [28]. Therefore, more accurate methods will be needed in the future. Sixth, the cohort in this research was a selected population, so may not be representative of the general population. In addition, this study only included subjects of East Asian ethnicity, so the conclusions may not be generalizable to other ethnic groups. Further studies are needed to validate our results.

In conclusion, non-obese NAFLD was associated with decrease of E/A, while more research will be necessary to evaluate risk of non-obese NAFLD for LV diastolic dysfunction in future.","With the further decline of LV diastolic function, the reduction in diastolic LV filling results in an atrial residuum, which increases left atrial (LA) pressure, causing an increase of E value.
We consider this result probably because non-obese NAFLD patients had more complications or some medication history leading to abnormal ventricular structure.
Non-obese NAFLD is similar to obese NAFLD in pathophysiology and non-obese NAFLD individuals seem to have an intermediate metabolic phenotype between healthy individuals and obese NAFLD patients.
Non-obese NAFLD patients generally had higher prevalence of DM and glucose intolerance than healthy subjects, while there was no statistical difference between non-obese and obese NAFLD patients [51].
Compared with obese NAFLD patients, TM6SF2 E167K mutation is more common in non-obese NAFLD patients [64].",2023-12-22 00:00:00,[],"['NONALCOHOLIC FATTY LIVER DISEASE', 'VENTRICULAR DIASTOLIC DYSFUNCTION']","['DISEASE', 'PATIENTS']",[],,

A new artificial intelligence (AI) tool is now being used to detect heart disease in record speed and vastly improve care for heart patients, according to research we've funded and published in the Journal of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance.

The first-of-its-kind AI tool analyses heart MRI scans in just 20 seconds whilst the patient is in the scanner. This compares to the 13 minutes or more it would take for a doctor to manually analyse the images after the MRI scan has been performed. It also detects changes to the heart structure and function with 40 per cent greater precision and extracts more information than a human can.

More precision and confidence

Each year, around 120,000 heart MRI scans are performed in the UK. The researchers say that the AI will free-up valuable time of healthcare professionals – saving around 3,000 clinician days every year – so their attention can be directed to seeing more patients on NHS waiting lists, which will ultimately help with the backlog in vital heart care. The AI will also give patients and doctors more confidence in the results so that they can make better decisions about a person’s treatment and possible surgeries.

The technology is being rolled out at University College London (UCL) Hospital, Barts Heart Centre at St Bartholomew’s Hospital which is part of Barts Health NHS Trust, and Royal Free Hospital, where it’s now being used on over 140 patients a week.

Following great success, the scientists and cardiologists who have developed the AI plan to extend the roll-out later this year to 40 locations across the UK and globally.

Improving heart diagnosis and treatment

The technology will improve diagnosis and treatment for a multitude of heart conditions. It is designed to diagnose a new heart condition when someone is first assessed for heart disease. It can spot early signs of heart disease - such as after having chemotherapy - which in some cases can cause damage to the heart, and it has the potential to screen for heart conditions in people with a family history of heart disease. The tool also helps doctors to see how patients with heart conditions are responding to their treatment, so they can then make any necessary adjustments.

The team trained the AI to measure the size of the left ventricle (the main pumping chamber of the heart), the thickness of the heart muscle and how well the left ventricle was able to pump blood around the body. They did this using heart MRI scans from 1923 people – including people with seven different heart conditions at 13 different hospitals and using 10 different models of MRI scanner. The AI was then validated on a further 109 patients who were scanned twice.

They found that the AI technology analysed heart MRI scans more precisely than three doctors, removing the issue of subjectivity with human analysis.

Dr Rhodri Davies and his team at UCL and Barts Heart Centre hope to develop the AI even further so that it can quantify heart valve disease and congenital heart defects, which develop in the womb before a baby is born.

Replaces hours of doctors' time

Dr Rhodri Davies, BHF-funded researcher at UCL and Barts Heart Centre, said:

“Our new AI reads complex heart scans in record speed, analysing the structure and function of a patient’s heart with more precision than ever before. The beauty of the technology is that it replaces the need for a doctor to spend countless hours analysing the scans by hand.

“We are continually pushing the technology to ensure it’s the best it can be, so that it can work for any patient with any heart disease. After this initial roll-out on the NHS, we’ll collect the data, and further train and refine the AI so it can be accessible to more heart patients in the UK and across the world.”

One innovation to help the backlog in care

Dr Sonya Babu-Narayan, our Associate Medical Director, said:

“This is a huge advance for doctors and patients, which is revolutionising the way we can analyse a person’s heart MRI images to determine if they have heart disease at greater speed.

“The pandemic has resulted in a backlog of hundreds of thousands of people waiting for vital heart scans, treatment and care. Whilst people remain on waiting lists, they risk avoidable disability and death. That’s why it’s heartening to see innovations like this, which together could help fast-track heart diagnoses and ease workload so that in future we can give more NHS heart patients the best possible care much sooner.”

This study was a collaboration between researchers at UCL, Barts Heart Centre at St Bartholomew’s Hospital, Queen Mary University of London, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the USA.

We have launched a campaign calling for the public’s support to power science that could lead to new treatments and cures for all heart and circulatory diseases.

An 11-year-old Cambodian girl from a village in the southeastern province of Prey Veng died on Feb 22 at a hospital in the capital, Phnom Penh, shortly after tests confirmed she had Type A H5N1 bird flu.

Her father tested positive for the virus the day after her death, but showed no strong symptoms and was released Tuesday from a Prey Veng hospital where he had been kept isolated, the health ministry said.

He was sent home after three negative tests.

The two were the only villagers among more than two dozen tested who were found to carry the virus, the ministry said in a statement.

Bird flu, also known as avian influenza, normally spreads among poultry but can sometimes spread from poultry to humans. The recent detection of infections in a variety of mammals has raised concern among experts that the virus could evolve to spread more easily between people, and potentially trigger a pandemic.

The health ministry said an investigation determined that the father and daughter had both “been infected from poultry at their village, and there is no indication or evidence that there was infection from father to daughter”.","PHNOM PENH: Recent cases of bird flu discovered in two Cambodian villagers, one of them fatal, show no sign of human-to-human transmission, health officials in the Southeast Asian nation say, allaying fears of a public health crisis.

With action on a globally binding agreement on plastic pollution at the top of the agenda, UNEA-5 participants are also set to take up a host of other pressing issues dealing with the planet and its inhabitants, including the thematic areas: nature for climate; nature for human and ecosystem health; nature for poverty eradication, jobs and economic prosperity; and nature for sustainable food systems.

UNEP/Cyril Villemain Norwegian Minister of Climate and Environment, Espen Barth Eide, who is the current President of the UN Environment Assembly, addresses the Assembly’s opening plenary session.

Espen Barth Eide, the President of UNEA-5 and Norway’s Climate and Environment Minister acknowledged that the Assembly was gathering at a moment of severe geopolitical turmoil, and said that in times like these, “more than ever, we must demonstrate that multilateral diplomacy can deliver.”

Multilateral action would be key to tackling what he described as “the noble mission to end plastic pollution.”

“Plastic pollution has grown into an epidemic of its own. Paradoxically, plastics are among the most long-lasting products we humans have made – and frequently, we still just throw it away,” he explained.

Noting that plastic is a product that can be used over and over again, Mr. Barth said that “if we move it into a circular economy. I am convinced that the time has come for a legally binding treaty to end plastic pollution.”

Inger Andersen, Executive Director of the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), said: “Over the last week, we have seen tremendous progress on negotiations towards an internationally legally binding instrument to end plastic pollution. I have complete faith that once endorsed by the Assembly, we will have something truly historic on our hands”.

“Ambitious action to beat plastic pollution should track the lifespan of plastic products – from source to sea – should be legally binding, accompanied by support to developing countries, backed by financing mechanisms, tracked by strong monitoring mechanisms, and incentivizing all stakeholders – including the private sector”, Ms. Andersen added.

CVD causes half of all deaths in several developed countries and is the major cause of adult death in many developing countries. And though some cardiovascular events aren't fatal, strokes and other forms of heart disease may still be debilitating enough to seriously affect functional ability. These concerns are contributing to growth in sales of cardiac markers, according to World Market for Cardiac Markers (POC and Lab-Based), a recent report by medical market research firm Kalorama Information.

Cardiac markers generated an estimated $2.52 billion in sales during 2021, largely as a result of the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, including those of the blood vessels supplying the heart muscle and the brain. Looking ahead, the market is forecast to increase by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.1% between 2021-2026, reveals World Market for Cardiac Markers (POC and Lab-Based).

“With the incidence of cardiovascular disease going through the roof, cardiac markers are in huge demand and a constant subject of research for improvement,” said Bruce Carlson, publisher for Kalorama Information.

Cardiac biomarkers are substances that are released into the bloodstream when the heart is damaged or stressed. In patients with chronic heart failure, measurement of these biomarkers is used to help risk stratify, to assess treatment options, monitor progress, and guide in-hospital and post-discharge care.

Physicians use cardiac markers in two ways—to diagnose a cardiac event in a hospital emergency room (acute care) or to evaluate the risk of a cardiovascular event occurring. The traditional markers—BNP, troponin and myoglobin are used in the acute care and tests such as cholesterol are used to evaluate risk.

An aging population combined with advancements in technology are innovating the market as health care providers seek ways to meet the demand for high levels of service in a more cost-effective manner.

An 11-year-old girl from Kerala, Leena Rafeeq, has created an application based on artificial intelligence (AI) to detect eye diseases and other conditions through a unique scanning method using an iPhone. Ms Rafeeq has named the application as 'Ogler EyeScan' and developed it at the age of 10.

She took to LinkedIn to explain how her application works along with a video demonstration. She said that her application can analyse various parametres like light and colour intensity, distance and look-up points to locate the eyes within the range of the frame using ""advanced computer vision and machine learning"". ""It also identifies any light burst issues and if the eyes are positioned exactly inside the scanner frame,"" she added.

After the scan is taken appropriately, trained models are used to diagnose potential eye diseases or conditions like Arcus, Melanoma, Pterygium and Cataracts. Ms Rafeeq said, ""This App was developed natively with SwiftUI without any third-party libraries or packages, and it took me six months of research and development to bring this innovative app to life.""

""I learned more about different eye conditions, computer vision, algorithms, machine learning models, and advanced levels of Apple iOS development, including sensors data, AR, CreateML, CoreML, and more,"" she continued.

However, it is to be noted that the Ogler EyeScan is only supported in iPhone 10 and above with iOS 16+. She added that her app is currently under review on the App Store. ""I am hopeful that it will be listed soon,"" the 11-year-old added.

Many users were left extremely impressed with her innovation and congratulated her on achieving this feat at such a young age.

""Good example of how we can reduce / curtail equity in health using AI. Great work,"" said a user.

A third person said, ""Wow, that's amazing! You have accomplished so much with your creation of Ogler EyeScan and I wish you the best of luck and some amazing appstore reviews.""

Replying to a user, Ms Rafeeq said that the model accuracy is ""almost 70 per cent"". She said, ""However, I am encountering difficulties with the presence of glare and burst from lights, caused by the distance required for capturing scans through the phone device. To address this, we have implemented metrics and detection for light-related issues, which prompt users to conduct a re-scan.

“Our humanitarian workers have been pulling people out from under collapsed tents”, he added.

Mr. Cutts described a scenario where many people do not have shovels or other equipment to clear the snow, so they have been doing it with their bare hands, while children walk in the snow wearing just sandals.

“It's really particularly difficult for the elderly people and people with disabilities, who are living in these torn and ripped and flimsy tents in thesesub-zero temperatures”, the coordinator said.

Vulnerable populations

According to him, about 100,000 people have been affected by the heavy snow and about 150,000 have been battling the rain and freezing temperatures.

“That’s a quarter of a million people who are really suffering now the effects of this cold spell that is going across the entire region”, Mr. Cutts said.

The area is home to 2.8 million displaced people, who are amongst some of the most vulnerable populations in the world.

“These are people who been through a lot in the last few years. They have fled from one place to another, the bombs have followed them, and many of the hospitals and schoolsin the northwest have been destroyed during the ten years of war”, he said.

In the last few days, humanitarian workers have been doing their best to clear the roads, deploy mobile clinics, repair or replace damaged tents and provide urgently needed items, such as food, blankets and winter clothing.

Mr. Cutts concluded issuing an appeal to the international community, asking it to recognize the scale of the crisis and to quickly get the displaced out of tentsand into safer and more dignified temporary shelter.

Escalation in fighting over prison break attempt

Following an attack on Sina’a prison in the Syrian city of Al-Hasakeh, last week, hostilities have escalated quickly in the region, with gunfire and explosions causing civilian casualties and pushing about 45,000 people out of their homes.

In a statement release on Monday, the UN Resident Coordinator and Humanitarian Coordinator for Syria, Imran Riza, and the Regional Humanitarian Coordinator, MuhannadHadi, expressed deep concern about the safety of civilians.

The attack was reportedly launched by ISIL extremist fighters who are trying to free more than 3,000 detainees affiliated with the terrorist group. They are being held by US-allied Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).

Most of the displaced have sought safety with family and friends in nearby areas. About 500 people are being hosted at two temporary shelters.

Humanitarian organizations are scaling their responses, but the two UN officials noted that “unhindered humanitarian access by all concerned parties is paramount to ensure emergency assistance reaches affected people.”

Mr. Riza and Mr. Hadi also reminded all parties to the conflict of their obligations, including avoiding the use of explosive weapons in populated areas.

Human rights

In Geneva, the Human Rights Council initiated its Universal Periodic Review of Syria.

Speaking to the Council, the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Bashar Ja’afari, said that, even though the country had experienced war, occupation, sanctions and COVID-19, it had managed to reform its human rights bureaucracy and judiciary and continued to subsidize health and social services.

Member States commended these efforts, highlighting a conference on women and peace that took place last year, and the participation in the review process.

144,144,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-new-vtls-simplified-border-measures-2502146,Planning a trip? What you need to know about Singapore's latest border measures and new VTLs,"SINGAPORE: Border measures in Singapore will be simplified to facilitate the arrival of travellers who are less likely to become severely ill with COVID-19 and burden the country's healthcare system while they are here.

""As Singapore’s incidence rate is now comparable with most overseas destinations, imported cases are unlikely to affect the trajectory of local cases,"" said the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Wednesday (Feb 16).

Singapore also announced the launch of new vaccinated travel lanes (VTLs) with Hong Kong and other regions on Wednesday. VTL quotas are also set to be restored and progressively increased.

Here's what you need to know:

HONG KONG VTL

As a Category I region, travellers from Hong Kong, including those who are unvaccinated, have been able to enter Singapore under a unilateral opening arrangement.

This arrangement will cease at 11.59pm on Feb 24 following MOH's review of the COVID-19 situation there.

A new one-way VTL will replace it, meaning travellers from Hong Kong will now have to be fully vaccinated to be able to enter Singapore quarantine-free.

Air travel pass (ATP) applications for travel from Hong Kong will close at 11.59pm on Feb 17.

Travellers with travel history to Hong Kong and who have valid ATPs can enter Singapore until 11.59pm on Feb 24. All ATPs for entry into Singapore from Hong Kong after this time will be rescinded.

Travellers with travel history to Hong Kong will be able to apply for a vaccinated travel pass (VTP) to enter Singapore from 10am on Feb 22 for entry on or after Feb 25.

FIVE MORE VTL COUNTRIES, MORE LINKS TO THAILAND

Previously announced VTLs with Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which were deferred amid the emergence of the Omicron variant, will be opened from Feb 25.

Travellers from these countries can apply for VTPs from 10am on Feb 22.

New VTLs with Israel and the Philippines were also announced on Wednesday, with two-way quarantine-free travel between Singapore and these countries to be established on Mar 4.

VTP applications for Israel and the Philippines open at 10am on Mar 1.

The VTL for Thailand will also be extended beyond Bangkok to include flights from all cities in Thailand, said the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS).

""Airlines that plan to operate from more cities from Thailand under the VTL may submit their plans for designated flights to CAAS for approval,"" the authority said.","Singapore also announced the launch of new vaccinated travel lanes (VTLs) with Hong Kong and other regions on Wednesday.

145,145,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/3/7/death-penalty-the-singapore-lawyer,The Singapore lawyer who defends those facing the gallows,"M Ravi has spent nearly 20 years taking on the cases few want to touch, and is convinced Singapore will eventually abolish the death penalty.

Singapore is known for being tough on crime, with some of the harshest punishments in the world, including a mandatory death sentence for certain offences, including drug-related crimes.

One lawyer, M Ravi, has been taking on the state in high-profile cases for decades.

Ravi has been diagnosed as bipolar and is currently suspended from practising law on mental health grounds, but he has been heavily involved in the case of Nagaenthran Dharmalingam, a Malaysian man with a learning disability found guilty of drug offences and sentenced to death.

A last-minute appeal that attracted worldwide attention gave Nagaenthran a reprieve, and he contracted COVID-19 in November of last year, further delaying the process.

Singapore’s Court of Appeal heard his case on March 1, and has reserved judgement until an undisclosed date.

Ravi spoke to Al Jazeera about why he takes on such challenging cases. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Al Jazeera: You are one of the few lawyers involved in the defence of people facing the death penalty. Why do you take on such cases?

M Ravi: My original focus was mainly commercial and corporate cases, looking at intellectual property, technology, that kind of stuff.

In 2003, when a Malaysian boy Vignes Mourthi was facing the death penalty [for smuggling 27 grams of heroin into the country], I mounted a last-minute constitutional challenge at the request of the former opposition leader in Singapore, Mr J B Jeyaretnam. He’s almost like a Nelson Mandela of Singapore.

On the eve of the execution, I asked the then Chief Justice if we could reopen this case. He said that the case had run its course and there was little I could do.

I then asked [that] if I could show that he was innocent, would Mourthi still be hanged? He said yes. That was a horrifying statement. I saw the way the poor and the oppressed were being treated. It brought me to fight against the death penalty in Singapore.

Al Jazeera: The Law Society of Singapore has suspended you from practising law on psychiatric grounds following your diagnosis of bipolar disorder. What has happened?

M Ravi: As I was preparing to argue Nagaenthran’s appeal, my doctor said suddenly that I am unwell. And that’s it, the Law Society said I have to stop as the doctor found that I am unwell.

I’m still doing work, preparing bundles of papers. If I don’t do that, Nagaenthran will be in the gallows.

The psychiatrists that have spoken to me from around the world, and other people I have spoken to, said that I don’t need treatment and just need rest.

Of course I am frustrated. I was originally told by my doctor that I can still argue Nagaenthran’s case and my MC [medical note] should end on January 13. Then he extended it to March 13. And the court is not going to wait, the Attorney General is pressing that Nagaenthran’s case should go ahead and be rushed through.

Al Jazeera: What other challenges do you face when taking on these difficult cases, going up against the Singapore state?

M Ravi: The Law Society and the Attorney General have applied to the Court of Appeal to suspend me from practice – or even strike me off.

That’s because of a case in 2020, the case of Gobi Avedian. He was supposed to be executed, but I managed to stop it. [Avedian was instead sentenced to 15 years jail and 10 strokes of the cane.]

The authorities are extremely frustrated because I frustrated their scheme of the death penalty. The Court of Appeal acknowledged that this is the first miscarriage of justice case in Singapore.

In this case, the Court of Appeal said we have made a mistake. The question I asked the Attorney General is ‘What if I had not come to practice law in this case?’ Gobi would have been gone. I criticised the entire administration of the death penalty.

Then there is the media. They constantly say that I am mad. There is psychological harassment about my psychiatric condition.

Al Jazeera: Will Singapore ever get rid of the death penalty?

M Ravi: It will. Just look at the case of Yong Vui Kong. He was only 19 when he was caught [trafficking heroin into Singapore in 2007].

This boy was supposed to be executed and, on the eve of the execution, I filed to stop it.

It took three, four years, but finally the law was amended [Yong was spared]. The law now gives judges some discretion.

So there is a precursor to tell us that things can change. Singapore is ripe to repeal the death penalty, most countries in the Southeast Asia region don’t practise it. Philippines is a no, Myanmar no, Thailand no, Indonesia yes but still slow.

And now we have Richard Branson taking them on and telling other rich people about it.

I think they have no choice but to get rid of it.

Al Jazeera: How confident are you and your team of Nagaenthran’s appeal?

M Ravi: It’s a humungous amount of work. There are five Deputy Public Prosecutors, they are all at the top. Singapore finds a lot of resources to kill people.

I think I will be able to win. Five judges are [hearing] the case. If it’s a shut case and not serious and open, they wouldn’t even come.

Secondly, psychiatric prison experts from the UK and Australia have given their expert opinion to say that the methods used by the Institute of Mental Health in Singapore are backwards. The tests are all wrong. The manner in which they are administered are very childish.","Al Jazeera: You are one of the few lawyers involved in the defence of people facing the death penalty.

146,146,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/ukraine-invasion-russia-higher-prices-petrol-food-electricity-singapore-2532281,"Higher prices for petrol, electricity and food: How Russia's invasion of Ukraine might affect people in Singapore","How will this translate into higher prices in Singapore?

The impact of the Ukraine crisis goes beyond oil and gas prices, since oil and gas are ""intermediate inputs"" into the broader energy supply chain, said Dr Broadstock.

“Oil converts to gasoline, and gas is widely used in the production of electricity. This is especially true in Singapore, where around 95 per cent of electric power generation is based on natural gas,” he said.

A rise in the price of oil means that making petrol or diesel is more expensive, he said, noting that while Singapore is transitioning to clean energy vehicles, petrol and diesel are still used pervasively.

“By the same logic, an increase in the price of natural gas makes the cost of producing electricity higher. There may be little room to navigate these increases in the short term,” he said.

Associate Professor Chen Tao from Nanyang Technological University’s Nanyang Business School said that the increase in petrol and electricity prices can be attributed partly to the “soaring price” of raw materials, including crude oil and natural gas.

Additionally, demand for petrol and electricity continues to rise as the global economy recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic, he said.

“In short, the imbalance between supply and demand in the global energy market helps translate higher global energy costs into higher petrol and electricity prices,” he said.

What other commodities could be directly impacted?

Assoc Prof Chen said that the conflicts will exacerbate strains in global supply as Russia and Ukraine are major exporters of commodities like wheat, metals, fertilisers, rare gases and other industrial raw materials.

“Russia and Ukraine together produce nearly a quarter of the world’s wheat, which are also major exporters of barley, corn and sunflower seed oil, among other products,” he added.

“And tensions between the two countries could disrupt prices in the global food market by increasing agricultural production costs related to fuel and fertiliser, destroying farmers’ harvest, as well as pulling up the relevant transport prices.”

Supply disruptions will push up the prices of metal commodities as well as prices of goods made from these commodities, he noted.

Russia accounts for 49 per cent of global exports of nickel, 42 per cent of palladium, 26 per cent of aluminium and 13 per cent of platinum. The country is also a “significant exporter” of steel and copper.

Ukraine supplies 70 per cent of the world's neon, 40 per cent of krypton and 30 per cent of xenon, which are important materials in making microchips.

“Disruptions in the supply of these commodities could have a major impact on the manufacturing sector, involving the production of stainless steel, sensors, semiconductors, as well as chips,” he said.

Quite a few commodities like agricultural products are grown in both Russia and Ukraine, said Assistant Professor of Finance at Singapore Management University Aurobindo Ghosh, adding that Ukraine is one of the largest suppliers of food grain, second only to the US.

“Food prices could see a triple whammy from increased fuel prices, reduced production due to conflict and delivery bottlenecks and supply chain problems related to the consequent sanctions,” he said.

Russia and Ukraine together export a quarter of the world’s wheat and Ukraine is also a major exporter of corn, he noted.

“A pause to manufacturing and production can lead to higher prices. Moreover, higher cost of natural gas, which is the main component in fertilisers, could push the crop prices up,” said Dr Ghosh, who is also the principal investigator of the DBS-SKBI Singapore Index of Inflation Expectations project.

How soon will the impact be felt?

Dr Ghosh said that while most countries have strategic reserves for food and other essential supplies, in land-scarce countries like Singapore, “it is difficult to do so for long periods, particularly for perishable items”.

“The price of petrol will be felt soon in the petrol stations as well as an increase in prices of some food items, if no action is taken,” he said.

“Having said that, there are steps being taken to release more strategic reserves of oil both from individual countries like the US as well as by OPEC+ producers.”

Dr Broadstock said that some economic impacts are already filtering through in terms of reports on higher petrol prices in some jurisdictions, but the broader range of effects will take a ""little longer"" to appear.

Supply chains typically operate in weeks or months, and it will be important to separate the impact of unavoidable short-term shocks from more manageable long-term market reconfiguration, he added.

“As such the next two months or so will become very revealing as to the trajectory of such durable impacts,” he said.

“What is hard to calibrate today is whether we are sitting in front of a contained conflict, or on the verge of something bigger,” Dr Broadstock added.

“Signals are worryingly tracking in the direction of the latter. Due to this, we are witnessing an unprecedented level of sanctions, military posturing and political rhetoric that clearly will take time to calibrate. But it has only been about a week since events began.”

Assoc Prof Chen said that although the price of commodities of energy, agriculture, and industrial raw materials has fluctuated sharply as the conflict intensifies, the “real test is still to come”.

“The production process allows producers to absorb price shocks and gradually pass them to consumers, and the transmission time of the impact depends largely on the production cycle of different products,” he added.

“For example, according to David Laborde, a senior research fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute, the real impacts on the global food supply would be felt in four months, when the next wheat harvest would begin.”

How long will the effects of the invasion last?

The crisis has years-long foundations and has triggered economic sanctions that will have “years-long consequences”, said Dr Broadstock.

“There seems no ambiguity that these will endure beyond the cessation of hostilities,” he added.

“Given the complexity of Russia’s pretext for sending troops into Ukraine, and the deep disdain voiced by other nations towards the move, it would however be speculative to predict how long the effects will last.”","How will this translate into higher prices in Singapore?

The project in Duval County — a sparsely populated Democratic stronghold about 145km (90 miles) west of Corpus Christi — would produce more than 2.5 million tonnes of green hydrogen a year upon completion, equivalent to roughly 3.5% of global grey hydrogen production today.

It will be centred around a hydrogen storage facility in the Piedras Pintas Salt Dome, with pipelines to the port cities of Corpus Christi and Brownsville on the Mexico border, where SpaceX’s Starbase is located.

“The company is looking at combining hydrogen with CO 2 at the Port of Brownsville to create a green methane rocket fuel for launch operations in South Texas,” GHI said in a statement.

SpaceX is currently developing a new type of rocket engine called SpaceX Raptor that would use cyrogenic liquid methane and liquid oxygen, rather than the kerosene-based fuel the company has used to date.

The first 2GW phase of Hydrogen City is due to begin operations in 2026, with two storage caverns in the salt dome.

“Access to salt storage is critical to the scaling-up of green hydrogen production as it allows for maximum utilization of electrolysers and serves as a buffer between variable wind and solar production and final delivery of green hydrogen to customers,” said GHI.

The Texas-based company — founded in 2019 by experienced renewables developer Brian Maxwell — says it could create more than 50 hydrogen storage caverns in the salt dome, “providing up to 6TWh of energy storage and turning the dome into a major green hydrogen storage hub, similar to the role Henry Hub plays in the natural gas market”.

GHI says it is exploring several possible end-uses for its hydrogen, including: sustainable rocket fuel; clean aviation fuel; green ammonia for fertiliser production, or export to Asia; or as a substitute for natural gas in power plants.

“We see Hydrogen City becoming one of the largest H 2 production centers in the world, supplying many different customers with 100% clean H 2 fuel,” said Maxwell.

GHI board member Andy Steinhubl added: “Hydrogen City is a project perfectly positioned near low-cost renewable resources, plenty of available land, salt domes, and proximity to the large energy port of Corpus Christi. It will be a world cost leader and position GHI to take advantage of the growing demand for green hydrogen.”

While Hydrogen City would be mainly powered by local wind and solar farms, GHI adds that it plans to draw “additional renewable energy… from the [local] ERCOT grid during periods of low prices.”

The largest single-site green hydrogen project announced until now has been the Western Green Energy Hub in Western Australia, which would be powered by 50GW of wind and solar, although it is not clear what size electrolysers would be used. A planned ﻿﻿30GW facility in Kazakhstan﻿﻿, powered by 45GW of wind and solar has also been unveiled.

There is also a project called HyDeal Ambition that adds up to 67GW at multiple sites across Spain, France and Germany.","Hydrogen: hype, hope and the hard truths around its role in the energy transition Will hydrogen be the skeleton key to unlock a carbon-neutral world?

Restaurant owner Seraphina Lee, 35, has been a fan since her school days and attended Singapore's inaugural night race in 2008.

Said Ms Lee: ""It's a shame we have not had the race for the last two years, but with the Covid-19 pandemic, it is understandable.

""It's been two years since we've had any real large-scale events in Singapore, so I think it's definitely very exciting, and I hope I can attend.""

This year's Formula One Singapore Grand Prix race is scheduled to take place from Sept 30 to Oct 2, and the authorities have stressed that all stakeholders will work towards ensuring the health and safety of all participants, staff, fans and the wider community.

Nanyang Technological University student Lim Jia Jin, 28, who has attended five of the Grands Prix events, said: ""I am excited as the last two races were cancelled.

""Singapore is a special venue on the F1 calendar and the event attracts many tourists and viewers, so I was sure that even after the contract expired at the end of 2021, it would be extended.""

Hotels too are gearing up to host fans, both local and foreign.

From 2008 to 2019, hotels, especially those in the downtown area, enjoyed near-capacity occupancy during race week.

In 2019, the last year that the race was held before the Covid-19 pandemic hit, JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach was fully booked, while other nearby hotels, including Fairmont Singapore and Swissotel The Stamford, reported 90 per cent occupancy during the race weekend.

Responding to queries from The Straits Times on Thursday (Jan 27), Pan Pacific Hotels Group's chief sales and marketing officer, Ms Cinn Tan, said it is in close discussions with partners in preparation for the race's return after the two-year hiatus.

Appalling conditions

“We are deeply concerned that these migrant workers may have been trafficked for purposes of forced labour, and have been living and working in appalling conditions in Serbia, at serious risk to their lives and health,” they said in a statement.

They were also disturbed by allegations that civil society groups wanting to assist the workers have not been allowed access to them.

The experts urged the Governments of Serbia, Viet Nam and China to ensure that businesses based in their territory, or operating under their jurisdiction, respect the human rights of all workers.

“This includes not only the businesses who rely on migrant labour but also labour recruitment agencies,” they said.

Duty to protect

Regulation and monitoring of labour recruitment agencies is also critical to effectively prevent trafficking for the purposes of forced labour, they added.

The experts reminded governments of their duty to protect against business-related human rights abuses.

Countries must also take appropriate steps to ensure victims have access to justice and effective remedies, and to ensure ongoing assistance and protection, including against forced return.

They also highlighted the obligations of businesses to exercise due diligence in ensuring that the rights of all workers are protected, without discrimination, recognising the particular needs and rights of migrant workers.

In an interview with HT Lifestyle, Dr Vikram J Rao, Consultant and Head-Dept of General and Gastro-Intestinal Surgical Sciences at King Edward Memorial College and Seth G S Hospital, shared, “Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a rare disease with an incidence of approximately 1 in 10,000 life births. It affects all races and both genders equally. It is an inherited condition caused by a defect in the Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC) gene mutation which results in a generalised growth disorder expressed as benign and malignant tumors in a variety of tissues.”

He added, “It is a dominantly inherited syndrome with close to 100% penetrance. Children of an affected parent usually undergo genetic testing at puberty and if affected, should have an colonoscopy immediately. The possibility of Hepatoblastoma, a rare manifestation of the germline APC mutation is a reason to perform genetic testing of newborns and the Hepatoblastoma screening with a six monthly liver ultrasound and a blood investigations in the form of Alpha-fetoprotein until the age of 7 years.”

Dr Prashanth Bagali, Practice Head-Oncology at Strand Life Sciences, explained how is it tested or recognised and said, “There are two ways to do this - One- When it is prenatal, for the woman who is pregnant, the gynaecologist will take care of her health in terms of ultrasound or any other scan that is done after the 5th or 6th week. During this scan, she will be able to see if there are any deformities or any kind of deviation from the normal growth of the child. The gynaecologist can also refer the patient to a specialist. In the second method, the child is taken to the paediatrician or general physician and they are trained to look for any clinical symptoms for specific rare diseases.”

He elaborated, “They will either identify the disease or they will send the child’s sample for further testing. Sometimes, they will know with behavioural changes but if the symptoms aren’t there, we call it asymptomatic. In asymptomatic cases too, the doctor can take the call to send the child and parent for further testing. Genetic testing is now available in India. Therefore, rare diseases can be diagnosed by using different test methods such as microarrays or the next generation sequencing technology.”

Talking about who can get it and how to go about it if your child is diagnosed with a rare disease, Dr Vikram J Rao highlighted, “Care of patients with FAP and their families is best given by the centers of experience and excellence. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a main risk in patients with FAP and is the main cause of death. The average age at the Cancer diagnosis is about 39 years with much younger onset in the patients with profuse polyposis. Symptomatic patients with presentation of pain in the abdomen or bleeding per rectum should undergo prophylactic Colectomy surgery using a oncologic technique as hidden cancer is elevated in the patient.”

He pointed out, “For patients who do not require Colectomy around the time of diagnosis should atleast have an annual Colonoscopy performed with removal of larger polyps and continued thoughtfulness of the timing of the surgery. Another important aspect is the fact that Duodenal cancer being the third most common cause of death in these patients upper GI surveillance with upper GI Endoscopy should begin at the age of 20-25 years.”

Bringing his expertise to the same, Dr Prashanth Bagali said, “Rare diseases are a serious public health concern in India, with an estimated burden of about 80 to 96 million cases reported annually. Moreover, 70-80% of rare diseases are of genetic nature, and thus are asymptomatic, but will appear in the person’s lifetime. Most of the affected communities are having high rates of consanguineous marriages (high genetic relatedness between individuals), high poverty, low education levels and inaccessible medical knowledge to make timely diagnosis of rare disease affected individuals. About 85-95% of rare diseases have no approved treatment and less than 1 in 10 patients receive disease specific treatment. About 50% of new cases are in children and are responsible for 35% of deaths before the age of 1 year, which has a catastrophic impact on families in terms of emotional as well as financial drain, as the cost of treatment is prohibitively high.”

He suggested, “Once a child is diagnosed with a rare disease, they are referred to a medical geneticist or to a neurosurgeon. The neurosurgeon or geneticist, will corroborate the symptoms with the genetic report. They will advise on the next steps and what the treatment should be. With the National Policy for Rare Diseases, all the doctors are aware about the insurance coverage and financial benefits to the parents of the child. Usually, depending on the financial situation of the parents and depending on the seriousness of the rare disease, the Government of India has started 8 centres of excellence to handle/manage rare diseases. All these centres have an information centre. The government has mandated that all the government hospitals in the district headquarters, in cities and even the private hospitals, should have an Information Centre for Rare Diseases so that patients can be directed to these 8 centres of excellence.”","Rare disease: Causes, signs and symptoms, treatment, who should get tested (Photo by Twitter/ionchannellib)As per National Consortium for Research and Development on Therapeutic for Rare Diseases, approximately 450 rare diseases have been identified and reported in India however, 80% of all rare disease patients are affected by approximately 350 rare diseases.

Some 10 million people contract the deadly disease each year, and a person needs to inhale only a few germs to become infected, according to the World Health Organisation.

The HSE took to Twitter to share information about the illness on World Tuberculosis Day.

In the tweet, the Health Service said: “TB is caused by bacteria and is one of the world’s deadliest infectious killers – but it is a curable disease.

“74 million lives have been saved since 2000 by global efforts to end TB”.

The HSE urged people to contact their health provider if they have symptoms such as a cough, fever or weight loss, if they are a close contact of a TB patient or if they belong to a high risk group.

TB is caused by bacteria, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and most often affects the lungs.

The illness is spread through the air when infected people cough, sneeze or spit, according to the WHO.

The illness is relatively easy to catch, as a person only needs to inhale a few germs to become infected.

Some 10 million people are infected with TB every year, with 1.5 million people dying as a result.

Despite it being a preventable and curable disease, this makes it the world’s top infectious killer.

Posting online, the WHO said: ""TB is the leading cause of death of people with HIV and a major contributor to antimicrobial resistance.

""About a quarter of the world’s population is estimated to have been infected with TB, but most will not go on to develop the disease and some clear the infection.

""Those who are infected but have not yet become ill with the disease cannot transmit it.

""People infected with TB have a 5 to 10 per cent lifetime risk of falling ill with the illness.""

COMMON TB SYMPTOMS

Prolonged cough

Chest pain

Weakness or fatigue

Weight loss

Fever

Night sweats

Those with compromised immune systems – such as those with HIV, malnutrition or diabetes and people who use tobacco have a higher chance of falling ill.

While most of those who get ill with TB live in low and middle-income countries, TB is present worldwide and is important to keep an eye out for the symptoms.

Often, these symptoms will be mild for many months, which can lead to delays in seeking care, increasing the risk of spreading the infection to others.

A strategy adopted by the World Health Assembly in 2014 aims to end the global TB epidemic by 2030.

WHO said: ""It serves as a blueprint for countries to reduce TB incidence by 80 per cent, TB deaths by 90 per cent, and to eliminate catastrophic costs for TB-affected households by 2030.

""The Strategy is not a “one size fits all” approach and its success depends on adaptation for diverse country settings.""","THE HSE have issued a warning to the public over Tuberculosis, which they described as one of the ""world’s deadliest infectious killers.""

The research, which suggests that the past two decades in the American Southwest have been the driest period in 1,200 years, pointed to human-caused climate change as a major reason for the current drought's severity. The findings were published Monday in the journal Nature Climate Change.

Jason Smerdon, one of the study's authors and a climate scientist at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, said global warming has made the megadrought more extreme because it creates a ""thirstier"" atmosphere that is better able to pull moisture out of forests, vegetation and soil.

""It's a slow-motion train wreck,"" he said. ""What we showed in the paper is that increasing temperatures in the Southwest contributed about 42 percent to the severity of this drought.""

Over the past two decades, temperatures in the Southwest were around 1.64 degrees Fahrenheit higher than the average from 1950 to 1999, according to the researchers. Globally, the world has warmed by about 2 degrees Fahrenheit since the late 1800s.

In the study, Smerdon and his colleagues analyzed tree rings to piece together water availability throughout history, using data that stretches back to the year 800 A.D. The scientists focused on a swath of North America from southern Montana to northern Mexico, and from the Pacific Ocean east to the Rocky Mountains.

Tree rings are one way that scientists can estimate soil moisture conditions in past climates. Researchers can build detailed chronologies by looking at the thickness of tree rings, with thinner rings indicating drier years with less moisture, and wider rings signifying wetter years.

The results can then be compared to other paleoclimate signatures, including from sediment samples and archaeological records, as well as observational data throughout history, to forensically fill out a timeline of Earth's climate.

The researchers found that several significant megadroughts have occurred in the region over the past 12 centuries, some even lasting up to 30 years. Before the current megadrought, the region had not experienced such dry conditions since medieval times, in the late 1500s.

But while droughts occur naturally throughout history, climate change is making them both more frequent and more intense, the scientists said. And compared to other megadroughts in the historical record, what's surprising is that this current drought shows no signs of letting up, said A. Park Williams, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the study's lead author.

""Twenty-two years in, some of these big megadroughts in the past were starting to peter out,"" he said. ""This drought is not petering out. Instead, it's in full swing and is as strong now as it ever was before.""

Based on current climate trends, the study found that there's a 75 percent chance that the current drought will hit the 30-year mark.

During that time, precipitation levels may fluctuate, with some years being wetter than others, Williams said. With such extreme dryness in the region, however, it will likely take multiple consecutive wet years to end the drought.

""When you have worse and worse droughts that are closer and closer together, there's just no time to recover,"" Williams said.

Isabel Montañez, a geologist and geochemist at the University of California, Davis, who was not involved with the research, said the study confirms the grim outlook that models have been projecting but adds a new component of isolating the impact of human-caused climate change.

""Being able to conclude that around 40 percent of this is probably driven by climate change is not surprising to anyone who does this work, but it's now been tested,"" she said. ""And it’s quantitative.”

Montañez's own research focuses on studying deposits in caves, such as stalagmites, to understand the incidence and intensity of droughts and wildfires throughout California's history. She said that scientists have long known about the impacts of global warming on droughts, but that communities are only now grappling with the consequences.

The megadrought has already depleted water supplies in two of the largest reservoirs in North America, forcing officials across states to rethink water management strategies for the years ahead. Dry conditions have also increased the risk of wildfires year-round and threatened the livelihoods of farmers and ranchers in the region.

""It's going to transform how we operate,"" Montañez said. ""Big changes are coming.""

While the study's findings are alarming, Smerdon said it's still not too late to avert the worst impacts of climate change. He said he hopes the research compels communities and governments to act.

""If you're on a boat getting tossed around by waves, you don't go up to the captain and ask, 'Are we screwed?' You find a bucket and you start bailing water,"" he said. ""That's the attitude we all have to have about this. We need to all go pick up a bucket and get to work.""","A dead fish from Lake Powell in the sand at Lone Rock Beach in Big Water, Utah, on June 23.

Last week, Russia passed a law making it a major crime to publish what it deems “fake” news about the country’s military. Violators could face 15 years in prison. And what is “fake” news, exactly? That’s up to Russian authorities. Reportedly, it will include any references to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine that call it an invasion, which would contradict the Kremlin’s insistence that it’s simply a “special military operation.” The Kremlin has also applied the term “fake news” to reports that a Russian airstrike hit a maternity hospital in Ukraine.

In other words, fake news means real news.

The law is part of a sweeping crackdown on freedom of expression in the country as President Vladimir Putin tries to cover up the indefensible: an unprovoked invasion of a peaceful neighboring country.

Russia’s Orwellian use of the word “фейки” — a phonetic translation of the English word “fake” — to criminalize truth is the logical endpoint of a years-long heel turn for the term “fake news.” The concept was first popularized in the United States by well-meaning misinformation researchers to describe hoax websites that posed as news outlets to intentionally spread fabricated information. But it wasn’t long before it was turned against the media itself, most notably by the new president, Donald Trump.

After more than two weeks of war, Russia has failed to establish military dominance over Ukraine. Here's why. (Video: Drea Cornejo/The Washington Post, Photo: Salwan Georges/The Washington Post)

In 2014, a researcher at Columbia University’s Tow Center for Digital Journalism who tracked factual errors by media outlets was noticing a new trend: websites that looked like news outlets but published entirely made-up stories that would often go viral on Facebook and other social media platforms. The researcher, Craig Silverman, referred to them as “fake news” sites. Prior to that, the term “fake news” had appeared in fewer than 1,000 stories per year in major U.S. news outlets, most often in reference to satire sites such as the Onion that aim to amuse, not deceive, according to a query of the news database Factiva.

By 2016, the trend of hoax sites hoodwinking social media users with whole-cloth fabrications had exploded. Silverman, then a journalist at BuzzFeed, published an analysis that found the most viral “fake news” stories — such as a baseless report that Pope Francis had endorsed Donald Trump — were reaching wider audiences on Facebook than real news stories from real news outlets. That was thanks in part to Facebook’s news feed algorithm, an efficient machine for widely distributing the posts that provoke the most reactions, regardless of whether they’re true.

Suddenly, fake news was big news in the United States, as Facebook faced pressure to crack down on misinformation and many liberals blamed those viral falsehoods for helping to propel Trump into office. But Trump, in a rhetorical masterstroke, saw an opportunity to twist the term to his own ends. By January 2017 he had adopted “fake news” as an epithet to characterize mainstream news reports that he wanted to dispute or cast doubt on. Over the course of his presidency, the term largely shed its original meaning, especially for Trump’s supporters, and came to mean instead any news report or outlet that made the president look bad.

Trump’s rhetorical jujitsu was not lost on political leaders in other countries — particularly, but not exclusively, those with a populist or authoritarian bent. Numerous countries in recent years, from Singapore to Hungary to Vietnam, have passed laws against fake news or misinformation, some of them arguably using the covid-19 pandemic as cover for a press crackdown with wider implications. Russia previously passed fake news laws in 2019, instituting fines and jail sentences of up to 15 days for “unreliable” information that disrespects state authorities.

Russia’s latest law goes much farther, with jail terms up to 15 years. Media outlets that were prepared to navigate the threat of censorship and wrist-slaps under the previous laws have understandably balked at the prospect of their employees and journalists spending large chunks of their lives incarcerated.

In just the past week, news organizations from the BBC to the New York Times to Bloomberg News and tech platforms such as Netflix and TikTok have either suspended or scaled back their operations in Russia, contributing to a truth desert in the name of “fake news.” No doubt that was part of the Kremlin’s intent.

Silverman and other misinformation researchers have been distancing themselves from the term “fake news” for years. “I helped popularize the term ‘fake news’ and now I cringe every time I hear it,” Silverman wrote in 2017. Facebook, after initially denying that fake news played a significant role in the 2016 election, later pledged to crack down on it — but then dropped the term in favor of “false news” as it became politically loaded.

Claire Wardle, a professor at Brown University and a leading misinformation researcher, said she also stopped using the term in 2017 when it became clear that it was being weaponized by politicians around the world as “an attack against the media.” Instead, she teaches the importance of using precise terms to characterize various forms of false or misleading information, such as “disinformation,” “propaganda,” “conspiracy,” “satire,” or “rumor.”

These days, she said, fake news — in the original, limited sense of websites that pretend to be news outlets to pass off bogus stories — is old news, as more sophisticated, politically motivated propagandists have moved on to techniques such as taking genuine images out of context to deceive people.

Perhaps the most efficient way to deceive a populace en masse in the social media era is not to try to convince them of falsehoods, but to discredit the media and sow doubt about the truth. For Putin, as for Trump, the concept of fake news has proven a potent tool for just that.

Speaking at the Uniting Our Voices event organised by Pfizer in Dubai this week, Prof. Al Shamsi pointed out that the age-standardised incidence rate of cancer in the GCC is higher than the global average, and that mass education and campaigns on cancer screening and early detection are the most important regulatory action that needs to be taken by authorities in the region.

He said barriers to effective early cancer screening in the UAE and the wider region need to be broken down by addressing target audiences at educational institutions and through the media. “By 2040, cancer incidence among the GCC nationals is expected to rise by 164 per cent for all ages, and by 465 per cent in individuals over the age of 70 years. Tobacco and obesity are the biggest risk factors in the region, but we need to do more about cancer awareness.”

Cancer is the third-leading cause of death in the UAE, after cardiovascular diseases and trauma, but although cancer care in the UAE has evolved significantly over the past 40 years, cancer literacy is relatively low in the country, particularly among the general population. Early cancer detection and screening are still evolving in the UAE, and experts like Al Shamsi have pointed out that the lack of a national screening programme and the need to address barriers to screening and consider less invasive screening methods that are likely to be more acceptable to the UAE population.

While various studies have shown that only a small percentage of people in the UAE are aware of the major symptoms of cancer or the importance of early detection, there are cultural and social barriers that prevent people from seeking information about cancer or discussing it openly. “We have a lot of taboos about talking about cancer, and we need to help people get around these and focus on awareness regarding that,” said Dr Rita Sakr, Consultant Breast Oncoplastic Surgeon and Director of Breast Clinic at King’s College Hospital Dubai. “As doctors, we need to make sure that the awareness messages get to our patients. We need to be sure that we are asking every patient about their family history, that they have instructions about self-examination for example, regarding breast cancer and remind them about the right age for screening.”

She also said it is important to get those messages to a larger number of young students, starting with schools and universities. “It's very important to educate people from the youngest possible ages about the risk factors so that they will become adults with awareness about screening and other ways of managing cancer.”

The UAE government and various organisations are taking steps to increase cancer literacy in the country. For example, the Abu Dhabi Health Services Company (SEHA) and the Dubai Health Authority (DHA) have launched several awareness campaigns to educate people about the importance of cancer screening and early detection encouraging people to adopt healthy lifestyles. However, experts are of the view that still more needs to be done to strengthen these efforts and provide improved cancer literacy and promote early detection and prevention of the disease. Dr Hassan Ghazal, Medical Oncologist at King’s College Hospital Dubai, believes the creation of formal advocacy groups and survivor groups is essential for supporting cancer patients. “At the hospital level, we tried to form a small patient advocacy group, but this is something lacking at the national level. But it’s gaining some traction because other hospitals are following our lead and doing it as well,” Dr Ghazal said.

“I just wish we have a broader advocacy group where survivors or patients can go and talk to each other. No matter how much we as physicians talk to a new patient, there is nothing more powerful than that patient talking to another patient who went through the same.”

Dr Dina Hamza, Senior Clinical Oncologist at Dubai Hospital, was of the opinion that patients should not wait for symptoms to appear to get a screening done, especially for three types of cancer. “Screening is approved worldwide for three cancers: breast cancer, cervix cancer and colon cancer,” she said.

“This does not mean these are the cancers we can screen for, but these are the cancers we must screen for. Screening for these three should be done proactively, and we should not wait for symptoms.”

Cancer literacy is a way of describing the skills we need to look after our health, Dr Nadine Tarcha, Pfizer Gulf Medical Lead, explained, and that it plays an important role in how we can understand and act on health information. “Low health literacy can affect anyone and many people find health information difficult or confusing. Pfizer has taken an important role in promoting clear health communication,” she said.

For example, the Abu Dhabi Health Services Company (SEHA) and the Dubai Health Authority (DHA) have launched several awareness campaigns to educate people about the importance of cancer screening and early detection encouraging people to adopt healthy lifestyles.

Your employees need you to step up right now. But it can be hard to know what to do or what to say. If you’re finding yourself at a loss, the author offers three simple steps: 1) Check in with your direct reports. A simple question at the beginning of a one-on-one meeting such as, “Have you been following the news? Do you know anyone affected?” can reveal an unexpected connection that someone might not have thought they could share. 2) Make space to talk during a meeting. Once you acknowledge the elephant in the room, you release some of the tension and allow people to focus once again on their work. Your goal is to be compassionate and understanding. 3) Give people the opportunity to take action. Research ways to help that are in line with your organization’s values, and provide credible sources for employees to get involved.

How do we manage our teams when a global, geopolitical crisis weighs heavily on our minds? There are atrocities happening throughout the world nearly every day. Unless something has affected us or someone on our team personally, we don’t normally start our morning staff meeting with a moment of silence. But when a singular event captures our collective global attention, how do we as leaders and managers address it?

My colleague Jon Haber, a fellow Harvard Kennedy School adjunct lecturer and president of Cascade Strategy, recently shared a thought that deeply resonated with me: “As a leader, anytime you communicate, you are speaking through a megaphone. Our words are actions.”

When you are in a position of authority, your words have special weight and you can use them to either foster anxiety or create a supportive culture. But it can be hard to know what to do or what to say. If you’re finding yourself at a loss, start with these three simple steps.

1. Check in with your employees individually.

We can’t make assumptions about how people are feeling or who in their network is impacted. Talk to your direct reports individually to get a sense of who is affected. Ask if there’s anything they need or any way you can support them.

A simple question at the beginning of a one-on-one meeting such as, “Have you been following the news? Do you know anyone affected?” can reveal an unexpected connection that someone might not have thought they could share.

This new HBR article by author Sarah Noll Wilson offers helpful advice for how to handle emotional conversations. “Sometimes people don’t know what they need, may be afraid to ask, or are unsure of what options are available to them,” she writes. “You might ask, ‘Would X be helpful?’ Offering a specific way to support them can make it easier for someone to say yes to accepting help.”

2. Make space to talk during a meeting.

I remember teaching a workshop for a group of public-school principals a few hours after they had received news that their annual budgets would be reduced, not expanded, in the coming year. To say they were distracted would be an understatement.

If something is weighing heavily on people’s minds, your meeting will be ineffective unless you address it. Sometimes we need to start by acknowledging the news and allowing space for people to discuss the issue should they choose to. Once you acknowledge the elephant in the room, you release some of the tension and allow people to focus once again on their work.

Your goal is to be compassionate and understanding, not to wade into politics, put people on the spot, or force anyone to speak. You could start your weekly huddle by saying, “I’d like to take a quick minute to acknowledge what’s happening. I’ve certainly been distracted and concerned by it. Who else feels the same way?”

3. Give people the opportunity to take action.

Many of us feel helpless in the face of a crisis, but there are avenues where we as individuals can collectively make a difference. Research ways to help that are in line with your organization’s values, and provide credible sources for employees to get involved. Ask them what organizations they support and let them use a portion of their working hours for volunteer activities. Many organizations are matching their employees’ donations to certain relief organizations, which both supports their employees and supports relief efforts.

While we tend to get overwhelmed or paralyzed by options, take one small step and go from there. One of my favorite quotes is by Saint Francis of Assisi: “Start by doing what’s necessary, then what’s possible, and suddenly you are doing the impossible.”

Whether it’s armed conflict, social unrest, or a natural disaster, geopolitical challenges will not go away. As leaders and managers, we cannot control or solve these challenges, but we can acknowledge that they affect our teams. When we establish a culture of openness and discussion before a crisis hits, we’ll have the foundation to support us in the eye of the storm.","Your employees need you to step up right now.

The brief also highlights who has been most affected and summarizes the effect of the pandemic on the availability of mental health services and how this has changed during the pandemic.



Concerns about potential increases in mental health conditions had already prompted 90% of countries surveyed to include mental health and psychosocial support in their COVID-19 response plans, but major gaps and concerns remain.

“The information we have now about the impact of COVID-19 on the world’s mental health is just the tip of the iceberg,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “This is a wake-up call to all countries to pay more attention to mental health and do a better job of supporting their populations’ mental health.”

Multiple stress factors

One major explanation for the increase is the unprecedented stress caused by the social isolation resulting from the pandemic. Linked to this were constraints on people’s ability to work, seek support from loved ones and engage in their communities.

Loneliness, fear of infection, suffering and death for oneself and for loved ones, grief after bereavement and financial worries have also all been cited as stressors leading to anxiety and depression. Among health workers, exhaustion has been a major trigger for suicidal thinking.

Young people and women worst hit

The brief, which is informed by a comprehensive review of existing evidence about the impact of COVID-19 on mental health and mental health services, and includes estimates from the latest Global Burden of Disease study, shows that the pandemic has affected the mental health of young people and that they are disproportionally at risk of suicidal and self-harming behaviours. It also indicates that women have been more severely impacted than men and that people with pre-existing physical health conditions, such as asthma, cancer and heart disease, were more likely to develop symptoms of mental disorders.



Data suggests that people with pre-existing mental disorders do not appear to be disproportionately vulnerable to COVID-19 infection. Yet, when these people do become infected, they are more likely to suffer hospitalization, severe illness and death compared with people without mental disorders. People with more severe mental disorders, such as psychoses, and young people with mental disorders, are particularly at risk.

Gaps in care

This increase in the prevalence of mental health problems has coincided with severe disruptions to mental health services, leaving huge gaps in care for those who need it most. For much of the pandemic, services for mental, neurological and substance use conditions were the most disrupted among all essential health services reported by WHO Member States. Many countries also reported major disruptions in life-saving services for mental health, including for suicide prevention.

By the end of 2021 the situation had somewhat improved but today too many people remain unable to get the care and support they need for both pre-existing and newly developed mental health conditions.

Unable to access face-to-face care, many people have sought support online, signaling an urgent need to make reliable and effective digital tools available and easily accessible. However, developing and deploying digital interventions remains a major challenge in resource-limited countries and settings.

WHO and country action

Since the early days of the pandemic, WHO and partners have worked to develop and disseminate resources in multiple languages and formats to help different groups cope with and respond to the mental health impacts of COVID-19. For example, WHO produced a story book for 6-11-year-olds, My Hero is You, now available in 142 languages and 61 multimedia adaptations, as well as a toolkit for supporting older adults available in 16 languages.

At the same time, the Organization has worked with partners, including other United Nations agencies, international nongovernmental organizations and the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, to lead an interagency mental health and psychosocial response to COVID-19. Throughout the pandemic, WHO has also worked to promote the integration of mental health and psychosocial support across and within all aspects of the global response.

WHO Member States have recognized the impact of COVID-19 on mental health and are taking action. WHO’s most recent pulse survey on continuity of essential health services indicated that 90% of countries are working to provide mental health and psychosocial support to COVID-19 patients and responders alike. Moreover, at last year’s World Health Assembly, countries emphasized the need to develop and strengthen mental health and psychosocial support services as part of strengthening preparedness, response and resilience to COVID-19 and future public health emergencies. They adopted the updated Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan 2013-2030, which includes an indicator on preparedness for mental health and psychosocial support in public health emergencies.



Step up investment

However, this commitment to mental health needs to be accompanied by a global step up in investment. Unfortunately, the situation underscores a chronic global shortage of mental health resources that continues today. WHO’s most recent Mental Health Atlas showed that in 2020, governments worldwide spent on average just over 2% of their health budgets on mental health and many low-income countries reported having fewer than 1 mental health worker per 100 000 people.

Dévora Kestel, Director of the Department of Mental Health and Substance Use at WHO, sums up the situation: ”While the pandemic has generated interest in and concern for mental health, it has also revealed historical under-investment in mental health services. Countries must act urgently to ensure that mental health support is available to all.”","In the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, global prevalence of anxiety and depression increased by a massive 25%, according to a scientific brief released by the World Health Organization (WHO) today.

163,163,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/coronary-artery-disease-ecg,Coronary artery disease ECG: What does it show?,"A doctor may refer to an electrocardiogram as an “ECG” or “EKG.” It uses electrodes to measure the electrical activity of the heart. This can help medical professionals detect heart abnormalities, such as heart damage or abnormal heart rhythms. One common health condition that an ECG can help diagnose is coronary artery disease (CAD). In someone with CAD, the blood vessels supplying the heart become blocked or narrowed, and this can cause chest pain or a heart attack. This article discusses how a doctor may use an ECG to diagnose, monitor, and stage CAD.

Can an ECG detect CAD? Share on Pinterest KATERYNA KON/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY/Getty Images The heart has different sections, called “chambers.” Electrical impulses cause the chambers to contract in a rhythmic cycle to keep blood flowing through the heart. An ECG is a test that measures and records the heart’s electrical impulses to show the strength of these impulses as they travel through the heart, as well as heartbeat’s speed and rhythm. A doctor uses an ECG to investigate: signs of damage to the heart

abnormal heartbeat rhythms, known as arrhythmias

the effect of electrolyte abnormalities or drugs on the heart’s electrical system. An ECG produces a graph of spikes and valleys that represent waves of electrical activity in the heart. This electrical activity consists of three waves : P, QRS, and T. The T wave has a feature called the ST segment.



Below, we describe these elements in more detail: P wave: This shows contraction of the heart’s atria, which refers to the two upper chambers.

This shows contraction of the heart’s atria, which refers to the two upper chambers. QRS complex: This shows electrical activity running through the heart to the ventricles, which are the two lower chambers.

This shows electrical activity running through the heart to the ventricles, which are the two lower chambers. T wave: This shows the electrical reset of the heart in preparation for its next cardiac cycle.

This shows the electrical reset of the heart in preparation for its next cardiac cycle. ST segment: This shows the end of contraction of the heart’s ventricles and the beginning of repolarization. Other important markers include the PR and QT intervals. The PR interval refers to the time between the first deflection of the P wave and the first deflection of the QRS complex. The QT interval describes the time between the beginning of QRS complex and the end of T wave. A doctor looks for changes in the waves that could indicate a problem with the heart, such as CAD. The changes could indicate a range of issues — an ECG is not a test specifically for CAD.

What are the ECG changes in CAD? To diagnose CAD, a doctor looks for changes to the ECG waves or segments. Changes that could indicate CAD or a heart attack include : ST segment depression

ST segment elevation

flattening of the T waves

inverted T waves

Q waves How ECG results differ for a healthy or severely damaged heart A normal ECG reading shows a consistent pattern across the P, QRS, and T waves. In a normal reading, both the ST segment and the T wave shows no signs of flattening, sharp spikes, or depressions. By contrast, an ECG reading of a severely diseased heart is noticeably different. The T-waves may flatten or have more of a downward slope, while the ST segments may have abnormal elevations or depressions, for example. Before arriving at a diagnosis of CAD or another health issue, a doctor likely needs to perform additional testing.

Using ECG to classify stages of CAD An ECG can show both stable CAD and acute coronary syndrome. Stable CAD Stable CAD occurs when a person has a “stable blockage” in their arteries. This indicates that treatment and lifestyle changes can restore and prevent future changes in blood flow. Stable CAD often does not involve changes in the heart’s rhythm. However, a doctor may note ECG abnormalities in the ST segment during a stress test, which shows the heart’s response to exercise. Acute coronary syndrome This refers to a number of conditions that cause a full or partial blockage of blood flow to the heart. Without treatment, these blockages can cause permanent heart damage. An ECG can reveal signs of this syndrome and any associated heart damage. During an acute blockage, a doctor can typically see changes to the ST segment. And Q waves can indicate a sign of a previous heart attack.","One common health condition that an ECG can help diagnose is coronary artery disease (CAD).

Kenya has heightened disease surveillance systems across its border points following the detection of the Marburg virus disease (MVD) in Tanzania.

In a statement released on Wednesday, Dr Patrick Amoth, the acting director-general for health at Kenya’s Ministry of Health, noted that county health officials had been ordered to remain on high alert to identify any possible outbreak of the disease within Kenya's borders.

Dr Amoth's sentiments come after eight confirmed cases of the killer disease were recorded in Bukoba, Kagera Province in north-western Tanzania and the south-western shores of Lake Victoria.

Five people have since died of the disease in Kagera after displaying symptoms such as fever, vomiting, diarrhoea and bleeding through various body openings.

""The ministry wishes to inform the general public to be on high alert and report any unusual increase in individuals presenting with high fever of unknown cause, and especially those with history of travel to Tanzania,"" said Dr Amoth.

""Such individuals are advised to immediately report to the nearest health facility for assessment and management,"" he said.

MVD infections on radar

Dr Amoth added that owing to the proximity of the disease's epicentres to Kenya, the state could not afford laxness when it comes to detecting any new MVD infections.

""Bukoba is the second largest port after Mwanza on Lake Victoria in Tanzania. The town is served by the Bukoba Airport and regular ferry connections to and from Mwanza that has connections with Kisumu in Kenya,"" he said.

""There are a number of buses that ply the route between Bukoba and Kampala in Uganda on a daily basis and some of which end up in certain destinations in Kenya. Further, it has been established that at least two buses with capacity 100 passengers ply Mwanza-Sirare/Isebania border route.""

Dr Amoth added that there is also substantial human traffic between Tanzania and Kenya through informal land as well as maritime border crossing points along the southwestern border with northern Tanzania.

""The epicentre of the outbreak is 611 kilometres to Kisumu and 1,079 kilometres to Nairobi by road,"" he said.

WHO on Marburg spread

According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), Marburg and Ebola viruses are both members of the Filoviridae family. Though caused by different viruses, the two diseases are clinically similar.

""Marburg spreads through human-to-human transmission via direct contact (through broken skin or mucous membranes) with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people, and with surfaces and materials (e.g., bedding, clothing) contaminated with these fluids,"" WHO said on its website.

""Transmission via contaminated injection equipment or through needle-stick injuries is associated with more severe disease, rapid deterioration, and possibly a higher fatality rate.

About half of the people polled here - 48 to 53 per cent - said they could tell if a piece of information on social media is true or false.

However, about seven in 10 - 69 to 76 per cent - admitted that they have unknowingly shared fake news, according to the study by the Nanyang Technological University's (NTU) Centre for Information Integrity and the Internet (IN-cube).

This is dangerous because confident people might end up believing information they come across that they do not have the ability to figure out is true or not, said Associate Professor Edson Tandoc Jr, director of IN-cube.

Another implication of the findings, said Assistant Professor Edmund Lee, IN-cube's assistant director, is that digital literacy here can be improved.

""This speaks to the need to educate people on how to find credible information,"" said Prof Lee.

The IN-cube study sought to understand Internet use in Singapore over time and polled between 420 and 1,610 Singapore residents online, aged 21 and above. The surveys were conducted in December 2020, July 2021 and December 2021.

On why some people share fake news without realising it, Prof Lee said that it could be due to how fake news tends to stir people's feelings.

For instance, scientific evidence is often conveyed in a very factual, even boring way, such as showing that vaccines work. This does not usually trigger emotions in people.

But people who are not on their guard may get emotional over fake news on how vaccines could cause side effects, making them want to share it.

Another reason why some people share news, even if they are unsure of its veracity, is that they have a ""better safe than sorry"" attitude, said Prof Tandoc.

Based on earlier focus group studies, this was more apparent among interviewees from the baby-boomer generation.

They forward the news to others to warn them because they believe the news will interest their family and friends.

This might be driven by a desire to maintain or improve social connections with others, said Prof Tandoc.

Between 51 and 60 per cent of the people surveyed also knowingly share fake news, the study found.

Prof Tandoc explained that this could be because people think the bogus information is funny and believe their friends will find it entertaining and hilarious. This was found to be the case among young adults, such as millennials, in focus group studies.","The IN-cube study sought to understand Internet use in Singapore over time and polled between 420 and 1,610 Singapore residents online, aged 21 and above.

But can a joint a day really keep the tummy troubles away? Spoiler alert: Prob not. Here’s what the science says about what cannabis can (and can’t do) for Crohn’s disease. Plus, we’re breaking down tried-and-true options if weed isn’t your thing. Can cannabis ease Crohn’s disease symptoms? Crohn’s disease is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that causes inflammation in the digestive tract. There’s not enough evidence whether certain forms of cannabis might improve symptoms like: nausea

decreased appetite

abdominal pain or cramping Some peeps also claim cannabis can reduce inflammation. But there currently isn’t any solid science that can prove this. Was this helpful? Share on Pinterest Victor Bordera/Stocksy United

Research on cannabis and Crohn’s There’s not a lot of research that shows cannabis can actually improve Crohn’s symptoms. But here’s what we do know. Probably won’t reduce inflammation Cannabis plants contain phytocannabinoids like tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). THC is a psychoactive substance while CBD may have some anti-inflammatory properties. Since Crohn’s is a type of IBD, the theory is that these properties might help ease symptoms. But that’s a big might. In a 2017 study, 20 participants received either 10 milligrams (mg) of oral CBD or a placebo. After 8 weeks, researchers found that CBD was safe to take but had no beneficial effects. It didn’t improve inflammation in any of the participants. One review analyzed the results of three small placebo studies that examined the use of cannabis in active Crohn’s disease. Two of the studies found that participants had a significant clinical improvement. But there were no major changes in inflammation. The researchers noted that cannabis might have the potential to treat some IBD symptoms, but there’s not enough proof right now. Also, we need more studies to show how isolated CBD can improve Crohn’s symptoms compared to other phytocannabinoids. Might improve quality of life A 2021 double-blind study assessed the effects of cannabis on folks with Crohn’s disease. In the study, 30 participants received cannabis oil and 26 took a placebo for 8 weeks. The oil contained 160 mg/ml of CBD and 40 mg/ml of THC. The simple endoscopic score for Crohn’s disease [SES-CD] and the Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) was analyzed before and after the treatment. These scores help assess the size of ulcers and quantify symptoms. A subgroup of participants also submitted blood samples to test for CBD and THC plasma levels. At the end of the 8 weeks, researchers found that the folks who had the cannabis treatment had an improved quality of life. But they didn’t find major changes in endoscopic scores or inflammation. FYI: The researchers noted that treating Crohn’s with cannabis should only be done in a clinical setting until more studies are available. More research is needed about its affect on remission During a small 2013 placebo study, 21 patients with active Crohn’s disease were divided into two groups. Each participant had previously tried other treatments to manage their symptoms, but nothing worked. They had 11 people smoke a cigarette that contained 115 mg of THC twice a day and the other 9 participants smoked a THC-free placebo cigarette twice a day. At the end of the 8-week study, researchers tried to figure out of the THC cigs helped improve Crohn’s symptoms compared to the placebo. Of the THC group, five went into remission — but so did one person from the placebo group. So it’s impossible to say if the THC was the real reason why participants had improvements. Also, this study is too small to prove the perks of cannabis to treat IBD. The researchers noted that larger patient groups and nonsmoking trials are needed.

Choosing the right cannabis product There are tons of cannabis products on the market, so finding the right type and dosage for you can be super overwhelming. But fear not, fam. Here are some tips on how to find the perfect product if you’re interested in giving it a try. Dosing It’s tough to determine an exact dose of cannabis if you’re looking to address IBD-related symptoms, according to a 2021 study. A lot of it depends on the concentration of THC or CBD, the severity of your symptoms, and how you react to it. That’s why it’s best to talk with your doctor first. They can help you figure it out. Types You can smoke, vape, or ingest cannabis. It all comes down to your personal preferences. (Just keep in mind that smoking products containing tobacco is a major risk factor.) You can also get varieties that don’t contain THC if you want to stick to CBD solo. Is CBD legal?The 2018 Farm Bill removed hemp from the legal definition of marijuana in the Controlled Substances Act. This made some hemp-derived CBD products with less than 0.3% THC federally legal. However, CBD products containing more than 0.3% THC still fall under the legal definition of marijuana, making them federally illegal but legal under some state laws. Be sure to check state laws, especially when traveling. Also, keep in mind that the FDA has not approved nonprescription CBD products, and some products may be inaccurately labeled. Quality A lot of cannabis products miscalculate cannabinoid potency or don’t report all of the cannabinoids present in a product, according to a 2017 study. That’s why it’s uber important you opt for high quality brands that have been third-party tested. Look for a certificate of analysis (COA), which is a verified document that has the deets on lab testing, potency, and ingredients.","Some folks claim that substances derived from the cannabis plant can calm Crohn’s disease symptoms.

171,171,https://www.heritage.org/public-health/report/covid-19-statistical-analysis-data-throughout-the-pandemic-and-recommendations,COVID-19: A Statistical Analysis of Data from Throughout the Pandemic and Recommendations for Moving On,"Alex Azar, then-Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), declared a national public health emergency in response to COVID-19 on January 31, 2020.REF The declaration soon triggered a frenzy of government interventions in the social and economic lives of 330 million Americans. Those interventions aimed to mitigate or eradicate the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

More than two years into the pandemic, “zero-COVID” now appears to be an unrealistic goal. The last major virus to be truly eradicated was smallpox over 40 years ago—almost 200 years after the development of its vaccine in 1796.REF

This Special Report statistically examines how the pandemic, and our understanding of it, has evolved over time. Using data from a variety of sources—both foreign and domestic—we examine the efficacy of natural and vaccine-acquired immunity in reducing the risk of COVID-19-related hospitalizations and mortality. We also look at whether the data support the assertion that the United States is suffering a “pandemic of the unvaccinated.” Lastly, we assess how new data, along with the advent of innovative treatments, should reshape public policy toward COVID-19.

We conclude that policymakers should adapt their approach to ever-changing facts on the ground, including the increasing likelihood that the SARS-CoV-2 virus will remain in circulation indefinitely. In fact, the director of the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Rochelle Walenksy, noted that COVID-19 “is likely to become an endemic disease here in the United States and really around the world.”REF We will thus need to learn to live with the virus as we already do with many other problems such as heart disease, cancer, hepatitis, influenza, and HIV. Coexistence should replace eradication as the lodestar of pandemic policy.

More specifically, we suggest that policymakers eschew restrictions and mandates and instead restore pre-pandemic social and economic arrangements, understanding the usefulness of vaccinations, natural immunity, and anti-virals at being able to control the virus. Or, to put it more simply, it is time to return to our pre-pandemic understanding of “normal.”

What We Have Learned About the Pandemic

COVID-19 Cases and Hospitalizations Reached New Heights in January 2022 Despite Aggressive Pharmaceutical and Nonpharmaceutical Interventions. Newly confirmed cases of COVID-19, generally defined as the number of people who return positive tests, have continued to rise and fall throughout the first two years of the pandemic.

As Chart 1 illustrates, after the first confirmed COVID-19 case was reported in Washington State in January 2020, infections and deaths fluctuated over the coming months, subsequently reaching a peak in December 2020 and January 2021.REF After the wave of new infections crested, the United States experienced a steep decline. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted emergency use authorizations (EUAs) to two mRNA vaccines in December 2020.REF The ebbing of cases and deaths occurred as tens of millions of people were being vaccinated, feeding the hope that immunizations would end the pandemic.

But during the summer of 2021, the Delta variant became dominant in the United States, leading to an increase in cases and hospitalizations, which subsided in September.

The Omicron variant, which became the dominant strain in December 2021, caused the biggest spike in cases since the pandemic’s onset. The new variant also caused a rise in deaths with COVID-19, although the peak number of daily deaths has remained far below the levels seen before widespread immunizations.

Hospitalizations, presented in Chart 1, traced an arc similar to the rise and fall in cases. Hospitalizations achieved three primary peaks: the winter of 2020–2021, the summer of 2021 during the Delta variant phase, and now most recently during the winter of 2021–2022 with the Omicron variant. Public health experts have cited disease proliferation as a primary justification for restrictive measures such as travel bans, mask mandates, and vaccine mandates.REF

It Is Not a Pandemic of the Unvaccinated. Since mass immunizations were believed to augur the pandemic’s end, some public officials attributed the surges in cases and hospitalizations during the summer of 2021 and the subsequent winter to the unvaccinated. This allegation took on highly political tones in the United States, where vaccine resistance was more common in red states than in blue ones. President Biden, for example, attributed a recent increase in hospitalizations to a “pandemic of the unvaccinated.”REF

“The unvaccinated are taking up hospital beds and crowding emergency rooms and intensive care units,” he said on January 4, 2022. “That’s a place that other people will need access to those hospitals.”REF

It is impossible to verify these claims using HHS data. These data do not identify whether a patient hospitalized with COVID-19 was admitted because of COVID-19, nor do they differentiate between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients.REF

Data sources compiled by states as well as the United Kingdom, however, suggest the President’s assertions are untrue. For example, Chart 2 presents data from New York State, which distinguish between patients admitted because of COVID-19 and those admitted for other reasons but who also tested positive for COVID-19.

As Chart 2 demonstrates, New York has consistently had between 4,000 and 13,000 patients testing positive for COVID-19. However, roughly 40 percent of these patients entered the hospital for reasons other than a COVID-19 diagnosis. They were hospitalized with the infection, not because of it. U.S. government data that count beds that are “in use” by patients with COVID-19 without making these distinctions thus overstate the impact of the disease itself on hospital resources.REF

It is also difficult to find comprehensive data that sort hospitalized COVID-19 patients by vaccination status. Although the CDC does provide some data via its COVID-net system, these data are based on a self-selected sample of hospitals and are thus not comprehensive. There are, however, some data on the issue from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the United Kingdom on the vaccination status of patients admitted with COVID-19.

The Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Massachusetts provides breakdowns of raw hospitalization numbers across all counties by vaccination status, presented in Chart 3.REF As is apparent in Chart 3, the number of fully vaccinated patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is indeed non-trivial and has picked up significantly during the Omicron surge. Chart 3 presents the percentage of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 who are fully vaccinated.

As of mid-January, nearly half the patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Massachusetts were fully vaccinated or boosted.REF Like New York State, Massachusetts also reports data that differentiate between hospitalizations with COVID-19 from hospitalizations caused by COVID-19. These data are presented in Chart 4.

As Chart 4 illustrates, since January 13, 2022, there has been a roughly 50/50 split amongst hospitalizations for and with COVID-19. In mid-January 2022, around 52 percent of inpatients who tested positive for COVID-19 were admitted for that reason or to treat complications of the disease. This percentage declined throughout the month of January, with incidental hospitalizations with COVID-19 surpassing hospitalizations for the virus in February.

The United Kingdom. Data from other countries can also shed light on the effect of vaccines on hospitalization and death, especially since the CDC fails to compile sufficiently comprehensive data on the issue. The U.K. government keeps data on the vaccination status of patients admitted due to COVID-19 after having presented themselves for emergency care.REF Table 1 shows the U.K. data for the four weeks between January 16 and February 6, 2022, during which Omicron was the dominant variant.REF

Of the 11,197 patients who visited emergency rooms in the U.K. and were subsequently admitted for COVID-19 over this period, 739 either had an unknown vaccine status or had received only their first dose. Unvaccinated patients accounted for 3,261 admissions (29 percent of the total number of COVID-19 admissions), while fully vaccinated or boosted patients accounted for 7,197 admissions (64 percent of COVID-19 patients).

In every adult age cohort, the number of vaccinated patients hospitalized for COVID-19 exceeded the number of hospitalized unvaccinated patients. In older patients—those ages 60 and above—the number of boosted COVID-19 patients outnumbered unvaccinated COVID-19 patients.

The President’s assertion that the unvaccinated are overcrowding hospitals and denying care to other seriously ill patients is thus unsupported by the data we have examined. The Massachusetts and U.K. data suggest that among hospital patients admitted for COVID-19, there is indeed a substantial number (nearly 50 percent to over 60 percent) that are vaccinated.

Vaccines Reduce the Risk of Hospitalization and Death from COVID-19. Although many, if not most, patients hospitalized with COVID-19 are vaccinated, that does not mean vaccines do not work. The reason: a smaller percentage of vaccinated people than of unvaccinated people enter hospitals. The risk that a vaccinated person enters a hospital due to COVID-19 is thus lower than the risk to an unvaccinated person, even if the number of vaccinated hospitalizations exceeds the number of unvaccinated hospitalizations. Analysis from both Massachusetts and the U.K. document this interesting finding that is perhaps counterintuitive to some.

Massachusetts Data. Chart 5 shows the percentage of vaccinated and unvaccinated Massachusetts residents who entered hospitals with COVID-19 between August 16, 2021, and February 9, 2022.

As Chart 5 illustrates, both groups have incurred increases in hospitalizations for COVID-19 over the past few months despite also having relatively low percentages (less than 0.15 percent) of their respective cohorts hospitalized for COVID-19. Nevertheless, Chart 5 demonstrates that the fully vaccinated comprise a significantly lower percentage than their unvaccinated counterparts, suggesting that they are, as a group, less likely to be hospitalized for COVID-19.

There are two limitations to this inference. First, Massachusetts does not group patients by age. Second, the data do not match vaccinated and unvaccinated patients for comorbidities. Those same limitations, of course, also apply to the raw counts of hospitalizations. Without such data it is difficult to comprehensively ascertain the effect of vaccinations at preventing hospitalization, which is worthy of future research. Nevertheless, based on our analysis using data that are available, it does appear that the overall hospitalization rate in Massachusetts is indeed lower among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated.

U.K. Data. Unlike the data from Massachusetts, data from the U.K. do indeed group patients hospitalized with COVID-19 by age as well as vaccination status. Table 1 above showed that roughly twice as many vaccinated patients as unvaccinated patients were hospitalized for COVID-19 between January 16 and February 6, 2022.

Chart 6 shows that, for most age brackets, the percentage of vaccinated people hospitalized for COVID-19 was smaller than that of unvaccinated people hospitalized for the disease.

For all ages, approximately 0.06 percent of unvaccinated people entered hospitals because of COVID-19. This percentage is more than three times that of people who have received one, two, or three doses (0.02 percent). Across all ages, the percentage of people hospitalized is lower for those who received three doses than for the unvaccinated, suggesting that those boosted against COVID-19 have the lowest risk of hospitalization.

All age groups under 80 have lower percentages of hospitalizations among those with one, two, or three shots than their unvaccinated counterparts. Hospitalization rates for those in their 80s and older are higher among people who have had one or two doses than among the unvaccinated, but those in that age group who have been boosted have the lowest rates of all. Regardless, all percentages are under 1 percent of each cohort’s population.

The U.K. data on COVID-19-related mortality exhibit a similar pattern. Chart 7 shows the number of deaths during the four weeks between January 16 and February 6, 2022, by age and vaccination status.

As expected, deaths are most numerous at the oldest age groups, rare among those under 30, and low among those ages 30–50. What is striking is the large number of deaths among the vaccinated and boosted compared with the unvaccinated. Those who have completed their vaccination courses account for the largest number of deaths, followed by those who have been boosted. Together, more than twice as many deaths occurred among these two groups as among unvaccinated people.

These numbers do not establish that vaccinated and boosted people are more likely to die from COVID-19 than are the unvaccinated. Chart 7 shows the percentage of COVID-19 deaths with 60 days of admission by age and vaccination status.

Chart 7 shows that the overall risk of dying from COVID-19 is minuscule for people younger than 50, regardless of vaccination status (<0.01 percent for all such groups having any level of vaccination and 0.01 percent for the 40–49 unvaccinated age group). For those in their 50s and 60s, the risk is most significant for the unvaccinated. That changes for those ages 70 and older. In the two oldest age brackets, the mortality risk is highest for those who have gotten two vaccine doses and lowest for those with three doses. While assessing the value of boosters is beyond the scope of this paper, this analysis appears to suggest that among the cohorts at greatest risk of COVID-19 mortality, boosters may offer the greatest level of protection.REF

This assessment is subject to limitations since, as with raw counts of the number of deaths by vaccination status, unvaccinated and vaccinated people were not matched by gender, comorbidities, natural immunity acquired from prior infection, and other potentially relevant factors. Adjusting for these factors would be a more comprehensive way to assess the efficacy of vaccines. Acquiring and analyzing such data are areas worthy of future research.

Altogether, however, our analysis of data from Massachusetts and the U.K. demonstrates that a significant number of people hospitalized because of COVID-19 are vaccinated and that most COVID-19 deaths that have occurred during the Omicron wave in the U.K. occurred among people who have been vaccinated or boosted. However, our analysis based on percentage computations across age groups also suggests that risk of hospitalization and death is lower for the vaccinated than for the unvaccinated for most age groupings.

Natural Immunity Reduces the Risk of Infection and Hospitalization. Since the pandemic began, research has suggested that natural immunity can be quite robust at preventing subsequent infection.REF The CDC, however, did not release meaningful data on natural immunity until January 2022.REF The study examines the impact of vaccination and prior COVID-19 infection against subsequent infections and hospitalizations between May and November 2021 across California and New York, which, the authors note, account for 18 percent of the U.S. population. It considered four cohorts of adults (over 18):

Those who were unvaccinated with no prior laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis; Those vaccinated (14 days after completion of a primary COVID-19 vaccination series) with no prior COVID-19 diagnosis; Those unvaccinated with a prior COVID-19 diagnosis; and Those vaccinated and with a prior COVID-19 diagnosis.

The authors compared these four groups in terms of incidence of confirmed COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations for California while only providing case incidence comparisons for New York (citing unavailable hospitalization data). Their results for California are presented in Chart 8.

As Chart 8 shows, the CDC study suggests that natural immunity is even more effective at preventing case incidence and hospitalization than vaccine-induced immunity is. Those who have both recovered from infection and been vaccinated appear slightly more protected. According to the study, there does not appear to be any meaningful positive effect of natural immunity coupled with vaccine-induced immunity on the incidence of hospitalization.

As the CDC study does not examine mortality, it is not possible to determine whether the same pattern holds for deaths as for infections and hospitalizations. Regardless, the CDC data indicate that natural immunity indeed provides robust protection against subsequent infection and hospitalization.REF

Recent research published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that breakthrough infections of the Delta variant created a robust immune reaction in response to the Delta variant. Although little work has yet been done on the Omicron variant, the authors suggest that the immune response may very well be highly efficacious against other variants as well, suggesting—though not establishing—that the Omicron variant could induce super-immunity against the virus.REF

While hospitalization and per capita death rates of COVID-19 were the primary reasons for initial government nonpharmaceutical interventions, statistics now indicate that natural and vaccine-induced immunity provides overwhelming protection against COVID-19.

COVID-Related Mortality Is Highly Age-Stratified Regardless of Vaccination Status. COVID-19 has impacted various age groups in society in different ways. As Chart 9 illustrates, more than 85 percent of confirmed cases are among people under 65, while more than 75 percent of COVID-19-related deaths are among people aged 65 and older.

Chart 9 lays out the probability of surviving a confirmed case of COVID-19 by age group. As Chart 9 demonstrates, the overall probability of surviving COVID-19 is over 98 percent. Those under 50 have better than a 99.5 percent chance of recovery. These probabilities drop quickly for older age groups, but still, those between the ages of 65 and 74 have a 95.4 percent survival rate, and those ages 85 and older have a 77.3 percent survival rate.

It is helpful to put the mortality of COVID-19 in perspective with other causes of death. We do so for COVID-19 in 2020 and 2021 and other causes of the first year before the pandemic in 2019, by presenting crude death rates in Chart 10.

Across all age groups, heart disease was the leading cause of death in the country in 2019, followed by cancer. COVID-19 was the next leading cause of death in 2020 and 2021 (115.9 and 135.6 per capita, respectively). The fully vaccinated, however, had a significantly lower per capita death rate (35.6), similar to other causes of death, including diabetes (26.7), influenza (15.1), nephritis (15.7), and suicide (14.5).

We also present a number of similar calculations in Appendix Chart 1, broken down by age. These statistics suggest that, for all groups under 65, the fully vaccinated are protected against COVID-19 as the virus carries a significantly lower per capita death rate than most if not all other causes of death across the respective age groups. Given the analysis presented in the prior section, this finding may also be true for the naturally immune.

The group 65 and above, not surprisingly, has the highest per capita death rates for a variety of illnesses, with cancer, heart disease, chronic lower respiratory diseases, and cerebrovascular illnesses leading the list prior to the pandemic. The per capita death rates for COVID-19 in both 2020 and 2021 (573.4 and 572.4, respectively), however, exceed a number of leading causes prior to the pandemic, demonstrating that COVID-19 has been a particularly dangerous potential cause of death for people above the age of 65. In fact, for the unvaccinated, the estimated per capita death rate (1612.3) exceeds all other causes of mortality. Fortunately, for the vaccinated this rate is significantly lower (115.2), below Alzheimer’s and diabetes mellitus. Thankfully, as Appendix Chart 1 illustrates, those in this age cohort who contract COVID-19 have between a 77 percent and 95 percent chance of survival depending on their age. Additionally, although the per capita death rate for the fully vaccinated (115.2 per capita) is indeed higher for the above-65 age group than their younger counterparts, on a percentage basis, this rate translates to 0.12 percent of the age cohort’s population.

Unvaccinated People Are Unlikely to Change Their Minds. Our analysis indicates that although natural immunity from COVID-19 does seem to provide strong protection, there are benefits of vaccination at averting serious illness from COVID-19. And while the chances of surviving infection are high for most age groups, vaccinated people have a much lower COVID-19-related mortality rate than do the unvaccinated.

Chart 11 represents the evolution of the number of people fully vaccinated against COVID-19 over time. After the FDA granted EUAs for two vaccines in December 2020 and the pace of production, distribution, and administration quickened, the rate of daily new vaccinations grew rapidly, peaking in the spring of 2021.

Afterward, uptake gradually declined, despite ample supply, with slight upticks before the fall and winter 2021 seasons. The American Academy of Family Medicine noted that primary reasons for vaccine hesitancy included a preference for natural immunity, concerns about safety and efficacy, distrust of government and health organizations, and desire for autonomy and personal freedom.REF As of February 22, 2022, 65 percent of the American population has been fully vaccinated against COVID-19."">REF

After vaccination rates slowed during the summer of 2021, even as the number of confirmed cases spiked, President Biden reversed his opposition to federal vaccine mandates.REF His executive orders directed various federal agencies to impose COVID-19 vaccine mandates on federal workers and contractors, hospitals and other health care facilities, and private firms with at least 100 employees.REF

These mandates faced court challenges. The U.S. Supreme Court struck down an emergency temporary standard issued by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration that placed a mandate on private companies, but it upheld an interim final rule by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services mandating that health facilities require their workers to be immunized.REF

Many companies continue to impose vaccine mandates on their workers. Some states prohibit such mandates by private employers. Others permit them but require employers to grant exemptions.REF Some states require public workers to be vaccinated, while others prohibit counties and cities from establishing and enforcing such mandates on their employees.REF

This patchwork of mandate policies had an uncertain effect on vaccination rates, which in January 2022 fell to the lowest levels since January 2021, when vaccines were still in short supply.REF

All of this suggests that attitudes among the unvaccinated have hardened. In September 2021, the Cato Institute commissioned YouGov to survey attitudes toward the vaccine and if specific incentives could change the minds of the vaccine-hesitant.REF We present some of the results in the study in Chart 12.

As this chart demonstrates, although most Americans have been vaccinated, and others say they are willing to take the vaccine, a high percentage (17.5 percent) is completely unwilling to do so. As presented in Chart 12, resistance varies by race but is nevertheless non-trivial across all races. Vaccine resistance remains strongest among young adults. Through February 22, 2022, over 23 percent of adults ages 18–24 and over 21 percent of those ages 25–39 had not received a single dose of the vaccine.REF

As the data compiled in Chart 12 illustrate, many unimmunized adults will not change their minds about the vaccine. The public health effects of their resistance to vaccines are mitigated to some extent by the fact that many unvaccinated people likely have natural immunity.

Promising New Treatments Can Vastly Reduce the Risk of Hospitalization and Death Among Those with COVID-19. In December 2020, the FDA granted EUAs for two vaccine products, both of which have reduced the risks of severe illness and death from COVID-19. In December 2021, the FDA granted EUAs for two anti-viral products: Molnupiravir (produced by Merck) and Paxlovid (made by Pfizer).REF Both are oral medications.

Randomized controlled trials for Molnupiravir found the drug to prevent 30 percent of symptomatic cases from progressing to severe disease.REF Paxlovid was 89 percent effective in preventing hospitalization, with no deaths reported in clinical trials.REF Both drugs were so effective that trials were interrupted because it would have been unethical to deny the medication to the placebo arms.REF

The Biden Administration has ordered 10 million courses of Paxlovid, making it widely available to prevent hospitalizations.REF One of the reasons some have continued to advocate for government protection measures for COVID-19 is because hospitalizations of COVID-19 still exceed those of common respiratory infections including influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). This comparison is discussed in a recent paper published in the Journal of the American Medical Association co-authored by former Obama White House adviser Ezekiel Emanuel, who now serves as a vice provost at the University of Pennsylvania Medical School:REF

The appropriate threshold should reflect peak weekly deaths, hospitalizations, and community prevalence of viral respiratory illnesses during high-severity years, such as 2017–2018. That year had approximately 41 million symptomatic cases of influenza, 710000 hospitalizations and 52000 deaths. In addition, the CDC estimates that each year RSV leads to more than 235000 hospitalizations and 15000 deaths in the US. This would translate into a risk threshold of approximately 35000 hospitalizations and 3000 deaths (<1 death/100 000 population) in the worst week.

Whether the stated metrics are indeed the proper thresholds to be using is up for debate. For example, a recent paper published in the European Heart Journal noted that sepsis and heart failure appeared to be the leading cause of hospitalizations in the United States in 2018.REF The authors note, however, that they do not have data to compare these rates against COVID-19 and that doing so is a valuable avenue of future research. Regardless, earlier in this paper in Chart 2 we did observe that over 40 percent of COVID-19 hospitalizations in New York State are not even due to COVID-19 itself, and thus the CDC almost surely overstates the impact of COVID-19 on the American hospital system.

Nevertheless, if Paxlovid indeed fulfills the promise of its clinical trials, then the drug could dramatically reduce the severity of illness and burdens on hospitals imposed by COVID-19 to considerably lower levels. As a result, we developed a model to estimate what monthly hospitalizations would look like under various assumptions of uptake of Paxlovid. We estimated that, from December 21, 2021, to January 21, 2022, the hospitalization rate of COVID-19 was approximately 3.5 percent of confirmed cases.REF Assuming 3.5 percent, 5 percent, and 7 percent hospitalization rates from new cases and that 60 percent of COVID-19 hospitalizations are indeed for COVID-19 (and not with COVID-19, as indicated by Chart 2), Chart 13 provides estimates of what the weekly hospitalization rate will be under a variety of scenarios of daily caseloads and people testing positive for COVID-19 taking Paxlovid.

Note that under all such assumptions, weekly hospitalizations are below the stated threshold from 2017 to 2018 stated in Emanuel et al., even if COVID-19 were to mutate to a more dangerous form and current hospitalization rates of 3.5 percent were to double to 7 percent.REF

Although Paxlovid is not recommended for patients with specific conditions such as kidney or liver problems,REF our analysis in Chart 13 does not assume 100 percent uptake, and if other people testing positive for COVID-19 take other treatments such as Molnupiravir, these hospitalization numbers would decline further.

Altogether, as Chart 12 illustrates, many of the vaccine-hesitant are unlikely to change their minds. However, as Chart 13 shows, although the fully vaccinated are unlikely to get hospitalized for COVID-19, antivirals such as Paxlovid do offer alternatives—especially for the vaccine-hesitant—for avoiding unnecessary hospitalizations and getting the country well below influenza and RSV levels.

Policy Implications

Zero COVID Is an Unrealistic Aim. The public policy response to the pandemic in the United States and throughout the highly developed world has focused on nonpharmaceutical interventions and vaccines. Both policies appear to have reached the limits of their utility.

Federal public health authorities urged lockdowns, mask mandates, school closures, and related policies in hopes of slowing the spread of the contagion until a vaccine became available. When massive immunizations began during the winter of 2021, there was great optimism that they would end the pandemic. Cases, hospitalizations, and deaths were declining from what were then their highest peaks, just as tens of millions of Americans were getting immunized.

By early July, President Biden, who had campaigned promising to “shut down” the virus,REF proclaimed that the United States was “closer than ever to declaring our independence from a deadly virus.”REF But independence proved elusive, as cases reached a new high during the summer and vaccination rates stalled.

The Omicron variant produced the steepest spike in cases to date, prompting Dr. Anthony Fauci, chief medical adviser to the President, to acknowledge that, despite the vaccines, COVID-19 “will ultimately find just about everybody.”REF While vaccines continue to protect against severe illness, there is little hope they will eradicate the virus.

Public Policy Should Be Transparent, Open, and Broadly Acceptable to the Public. Policymakers should plainly and emphatically communicate that it is highly unlikely that the pathogen will be extinguished. It is far more likely that the virus will continue to circulate and that new variants will emerge, as has been the case with other respiratory diseases.

They should also shift from crisis communication mode, which depicts the risks of the virus in dire terms and without context. As Appendix Chart 1 shows, unintentional injuries, homicides, and suicides are more likely causes of death than COVID-19 among the fully vaccinated in many age groups. Additionally, data from New York State and Massachusetts on hospitalizations for and with COVID-19 suggest that hospitalization statistics presented by the agency may very well be inflated above actual levels.

The CDC should juxtapose hospitalization and mortality statistics for COVID-19 with analogous statistics for other common illnesses and causes of death and emphasize that risks are highly age-stratified. Statistics of this nature will enable the public to put COVID-19 in perspective with other public health problems we have faced as a nation, including obesity, HIV, and influenza, among others. Just as the CDC has a responsibility to inform Americans of public health dangers, the agency should also tell people when they are safe from severe illness and death from COVID-19.

End Nonpharmaceutical Interventions, Mandates, and Vax Shaming. Lockdowns, mask mandates, suspensions of in-person learning, and other nonpharmaceutical interventions were of dubious value. A meta-analysis of peer-reviewed studies of the value of lockdowns published by Johns Hopkins University concluded that while “lockdowns have had little to no public health effects, they have imposed enormous economic and social costs where they have been adopted.”REF A meta-analysis of the value of cloth masks published by the Cato Institute found “weak evidence” for facemask efficacy, adding that “ethical principles require that the strength of the evidence and the best estimates of amount of benefit be truthfully communicated to the public.”REF A study of the efficacy of extended school closures published by the British Royal Society concluded that “the lower susceptibility of school children subst","This percentage declined throughout the month of January, with incidental hospitalizations with COVID-19 surpassing hospitalizations for the virus in February.
Unvaccinated patients accounted for 3,261 admissions (29 percent of the total number of COVID-19 admissions), while fully vaccinated or boosted patients accounted for 7,197 admissions (64 percent of COVID-19 patients).
In every adult age cohort, the number of vaccinated patients hospitalized for COVID-19 exceeded the number of hospitalized unvaccinated patients.
In older patients—those ages 60 and above—the number of boosted COVID-19 patients outnumbered unvaccinated COVID-19 patients.

The Hill's horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus hilli) is listed as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. It was not known whether the creatures still existed in the wild, but researchers announced Tuesday that the species has been rediscovered.

""Going into this project we feared the species may have already gone extinct,"" Jon Flanders, the director of endangered species interventions at Bat Conservation International, said in a statement.

The bat was caught in January 2019 during a 10-day expedition in Rwanda's Nyungwe National Park.

Flanders called it an ""incredible"" discovery, adding that ""it's astonishing to think that we're the first people to see this bat in so long.""

Winifred Frick, Bat Conservation International's chief scientist, said a horseshoe bat is easily identifiable by its nose leaf, or the distinctive folds of skin around its nostrils. The lower part of a horseshoe bat's nose leaf is typically U-shaped, like a horseshoe, which is how the creatures got their name. Even still, Frick said, it was clear that they had stumbled on something special.

""We knew immediately that the bat we had captured was unusual and remarkable,"" she said in a statement. ""The facial features were exaggerated to the point of comical.""

Bat Conservation International and collaborators collect data on several bat species in Rwanda's Nyungwe National Park. Jon Flanders / Bat Conservation International

The scientists took extensive measurements of the bat before it was released again into the wild. The researchers were able to compare the newfound specimen with records in various museum archives in Europe to confirm the species.

Frick and her colleagues also recorded the echolocation calls of the Hill's horseshoe bat, which are the high-frequency pulses of sound bats emit to navigate and hunt for prey.

""Knowing the echolocation calls for this species is a game changer,"" said one of the team’s lead scientists, Paul Webala, a senior lecturer at Maasai Mara University in Kenya.

The recorded sound waves allowed park rangers in Rwanda to track and ""eavesdrop"" on the flying mammals in their natural habitat. Over nine months, audio surveys were conducted in 23 spots in the national park, revealing the presence of Hill's horseshoe bats at eight locations confined to a small area, according to Bat Conservation International.

Narrowing the limited range will help researchers with conservation efforts to protect the elusive species, Flanders said. Details about the Hill's horseshoe bat have also been made publicly available through the Global Biodiversity Information Facility to raise awareness about the rare species and other imperiled bats.

""These data belong to anyone and everyone working to ensure these species have protected forests to call home,"" Frick said in the statement. ""Open data sharing ensures we live up to the promise that conservation benefits us all.""

The bat's discovery was part of field work that began in 2013 by researchers with the Rwanda Wildlife Conservation Association, the Rwanda Development Board and Bat Conservation International.","The Hill's horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus hilli) is listed as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

178,178,https://www.wpr.org/doctors-debate-patients-suffer-fight-over-chronic-lyme-disease-wisconsin,"Doctors debate, patients suffer: The fight over chronic Lyme disease in Wisconsin","If life had gone as planned, Maria Alice Lima Freitas would be in medical school, inspired by the career of her father, a surgeon who practiced in Brazil. But instead of changing careers, the 49-year-old therapist retired from University of Wisconsin-Madison.

Freitas says her undiagnosed Lyme disease has sapped her energy, fogged her thinking and caused pain in her neck, shoulders, hands and right knee. She has three times deferred her entrance into medical school while struggling with myriad symptoms that she attributes to Lyme.

Most of her doctors say she is mistaken, and that her symptoms, which began in 2015, are due to rheumatoid arthritis, or RA.

Freitas is among thousands of Wisconsinites who say they are suffering from a chronic or long-term version of the disease. The infection comes from tiny ticks primarily found in the northeastern United States, including in Wisconsin — which is a hot spot for Lyme, ranking No. 5 among states for Lyme cases in 2019.

Nationally, Lyme disease infects an estimated 476,000 people a year. The Wisconsin Department of Health Services reports the state had 3,076 estimated cases of Lyme disease in 2020 — a doubling in the past 15 years. But medical entomologists say Lyme cases in the state could be 10 times higher than reported.

The medical establishment calls Lyme a short-term disease that usually quickly resolves with antibiotics. Self-described ""Lyme-literate"" practitioners argue patients like Freitas suffer from a long-haul version of the disease, often called chronic Lyme disease.

The orthodox position held by most scientific experts and some professional associations — and endorsed by U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — is that Lyme disease is an acute infectious disease. Clinical diagnosis is based on a ""bull's-eye"" rash, other specific symptoms and two-tiered antibody tests. Treatment is by short courses of oral antibiotics. And persistent symptoms rarely occur.

The standard antibody testing for Lyme disease, cleared by the Food and Drug Administration and endorsed by insurance companies, has been criticized by patients and practitioners as inadequate to detect all cases of the disease. Some practitioners offer alternative tests and treatments, but insurance does not cover the cost of their care. And in extreme situations, such doctors risk disciplinary action.

For most people, Lyme disease is treatable and curable. Most patients report their symptoms cleared after a short course of antibiotics if the infection is recognized and treated early. Another 10 to 20 percent of patients develop more severe cases whose symptoms include debilitating pain, fatigue, brain fog, irritability and sleep disorders.

Dark-skinned patients face particular difficulties in getting a Lyme diagnosis. Identifying the red target symbol over light skin tone is easy for light-skinned people, but not so with dark skin tones. A recent UCLA study found 34 percent of Black patients with Lyme disease had neurological complications compared to just 9% of whites, suggesting the disease may not have been recognized for many Black patients in earlier stages when it’s easier to treat.

Patients with persistent symptoms struggle to get a diagnosis. Wisconsin Watch has spoken with five people in addition to Freitas whose persistent, subjective symptoms fall outside the mainstream definition of Lyme as an acute disease. Caught in the middle of the debate, they face emotional, physical, mental and financial exhaustion as they bounce between specialists in search of explanations for their pain.

""The best way I can explain…I’m going through hell, (and) keep on going,"" Freitas said.

Diagnoses: Viral infection, arthritis

Freitas’ Lyme journey began in March 2019 as she battled monthly bouts of fever. She had trouble falling back to sleep late at night. Her hair rapidly fell out. And her body ached and her neck was stiff. She suffered from severe pain in her joints, bones and chest. She also felt tired. At first, Freitas attributed the exhaustion to the bladder surgery she had undergone in April. Fevers hit her in June and again in July.

The unbearable pain made it hard for her to work. It felt like someone was scraping the inside of her right knee with a knife. By August of that year, Freitas took a medical leave, unable to work.

She checked into a Madison hospital for a couple of days. She said the doctor ordered a variety of tests — but not for Lyme. Freitas was diagnosed with a viral infection, which she said failed to explain her full slate of symptoms, including electric sensations on her face and arms and forgetfulness.

Four summers earlier, Freitas said she similarly felt eye pain, knuckle pain, fatigue, forgetfulness and headaches. She recalled a rash that had stayed on her leg for at least three weeks. Freitas saw a rheumatologist at St. Mary's in early July 2015.

The doctor noticed a red spot on her leg, but it was not the classic Lyme sign of ""bull’s-eye"" rash. She recalls being tested for Lyme, but the two-step testing came back negative.

The doctor deemed the red spot a likely spider bite and diagnosed her with arthritis. After taking pain medication for a month, Freitas began to feel better. When more symptoms took hold in 2019, she sensed that viral infection alone did not explain them. Freitas started reading articles about Lyme disease.

Her husband, John Oppenheimer, recalled his wife devouring medical journal articles. Freitas has a bachelor’s degree in biology from UW-Madison and a master’s in marriage and family therapy from Edgewood College. In late 2018, a Florida-based medical school had admitted her to a pre-med program, but her declining health disrupted those plans.

Freitas floated the Lyme hypothesis to a rheumatologist, who felt the joint pain and hand swelling looked more like RA. Test results also suggested Freitas may have RA.



Maria Alice Lima Freitas is comforted by group leader Alicia Cashman during a meeting of the Madison Area Lyme Support Group at the East Madison Police Station in Madison, Wis., on Feb. 8, 2020. Freitas believes she suffers from chronic Lyme disease but has struggled to find doctors who agree. She wept frequently throughout the meeting — the first one she had attended— as other participants shared their personal experiences. She later said she became emotional after realizing she was not imagining her symptoms. She attended the meeting with her husband John Oppenheimer, left. Coburn Dukehart/Wisconsin Watch

Questions about testing

Freitas was not convinced. ""I have other symptoms that can’t be explained by RA,"" she said. She had read journal articles about the difficulty in Lyme diagnosis, finding the recommended tests are ""pretty fallible.""

CDC recommends a two-step testing process for determining whether a person has Lyme disease. Both blood tests must come out positive — or at least indeterminate — for a Lyme diagnosis to be made, the agency recommends.

The two tests measure antibodies that can remain in a person’s system for months or even years and therefore may not indicate an ongoing infection.""It cannot tell when you got infected,"" said Elitza Theel, who directs Mayo Clinic’s Infectious Diseases Serology Laboratory.

And the testing has other drawbacks. ""It cannot tell what disease severity (is), and it cannot tell whether or not you responded to treatment,"" Theel said. ""It’s important to remember that we’re not making a diagnosis based on a test result alone.""

She went on to say that the testing also cannot be used to detect other infections that may cause Lyme-like symptoms. ""You would have to test for those other infections,"" she said.

Freitas tested positive in the first stage of testing but not the second, showing three bands instead of the five that the CDC says are proof of Lyme disease.

She asked the rheumatologist to order a different type of test from IGeneX, a California-based commercial laboratory, hoping that the insurance company would at least cover some cost. It didn’t.

""It’s expensive. I don’t have the money. I’ve been out of my job since August,"" Freitas recalled.

The results from that $2,600 test came in December 2019. It indicated she did have Lyme disease. However, the IGeneX testing is not conclusive, either, Theel said. ""Their criteria are less stringent than the CDC,” she said, “which will lead to a higher number of false positive results.""

Her rheumatologist refused to accept the result, Freitas and Oppenheimer said, calling it a ""sh-t test.""

Health woes lead to self-doubt

Oppenheimer said Freitas, once wildly independent, increasingly depends on him as she struggles with her health. The two met when she was a single mom driving a Madison Metro bus and juggling classes at the UW-Madison. Oppenheimer had overheard her speaking in Portuguese, and he tried to put together a phrase that he could speak in the same language. That led to a first date — and in 2011, marriage.

But these days, Oppenheimer said, his wife is very drained.

And even friends and family members question whether the symptoms Freitas describes are real.

""When everybody is saying that it is not Lyme,"" Freitas said, ""you start to question yourself.""

She tried a four-week course of doxycycline, the first-line antibiotics therapy for treating Lyme disease, prescribed by another rheumatologist. She began to feel better, with less pain and less brain fog. However, the symptoms returned once she completed the treatment. She even found herself starting to stutter.

Oppenheimer himself was diagnosed with Lyme disease as a 19-year-old. At the time, he was living less than 50 miles from Lyme, Connecticut, the community for which the disease was named.

He described an ""arrogant unwillingness"" by the medical establishment to recognize what he believes are his wife’s ongoing symptoms of Lyme disease.

""(I’m) just trying to be there with her and seemingly nothing to be able to do, and it’s horrible to watch,"" he said.

Lyme controversial from the start

In autumn 1975, Polly Murray, an artist and mother of four in Lyme, reported to the state health department that she and her children were suffering from mysterious maladies, including stiff and swollen knees and rashes. And neighboring children were having similar hard-to-explain symptoms.

Physicians diagnosed the children with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Another mother from the area, Judith Mensch, also contacted the state health department. Finally, the cluster aroused the attention of the Connecticut public health authorities. Yale University’s Dr. Allen Steere, who was still a rheumatologist-in-training, began searching for a cause.

The following year, Steere told the Journal of the American Medical Association, that he strongly suspected the illness came from some type of infection.

In the early 1980s, Willy Burgdorfer, a medical entomologist at Rocky Mountain Laboratories, identified the bacterium that caused the mysterious affliction. It was named Borrelia burgdorferi after him.

Robert A. Aronowitz, a medical historian at the University of Pennsylvania, said the divide between mainstream medicine and Lyme patient advocates started early — with Patty Murray herself. He noted that Murray created local Lyme support groups starting in the 1980s that began to position themselves ""in opposition to the leading Lyme disease physicians and scientists and their view of the disease.""

In her 1996 book, ""The Widening Circle,"" Murray warned of long-term cases of the disease. ""To me, the fact that some cases seemed to be chronic, lasting for many years, meant that somehow the infection smoldered in some patients and was set off by an immune reaction, perhaps patients were being repeatedly re-infected by the organism,"" she wrote.

Two camps, two approaches

Freitas saw a long string of mainstream physicians for a diagnosis — rheumatologists, an infectious-disease specialist, family medicine doctors and emergency room physicians. Then, in the spring of 2020, she began seeing out-of-network doctors in and outside of Wisconsin, and many of them didn’t take insurance.

A survey of more than 2,400 U.S. patients found 50 percent of the respondents reported seeing at least seven physicians before a Lyme diagnosis, and more than half continued to suffer symptoms for at least six months after the recommended short course of antibiotics.

In January 2021, Freitas borrowed $4,000 from her mother-in-law and flew to Washington, D.C., to receive intravenous antibiotic therapy. The treatments failed to help; in fact she dropped 30 pounds in a matter of weeks. ""I thought I was gonna die because I couldn’t eat,"" Freitas said.





Maria Alice Lima Freitas pays about $1,200 a month for medicine, vitamins and treatment for her chronic Lyme disease. She is pictured at her home in Middleton, Wis., on Oct. 6, 2021, with her husband John Oppenheimer. Freitas is now being treated by Dr. Samuel Shor of the Tick-Borne Illness Center of Excellence in Woodruff, Wisconsin. She says her brain is still sometimes foggy but emotionally she is much better and feels optimistic that a doctor is finally taking her symptoms seriously. Coburn Dukehart/Wisconsin Watch She continued to search for doctors.

On May 19, Oppenheimer and Freitas drove from their house in a quiet neighborhood in Middleton to northern Wisconsin.

They were on their way to a virtual visit with Dr. Samuel Shor. The Virginia-based internist works for the Tick-Borne Illness Center of Excellence in Woodruff. Shor, who also is a clinical associate professor at George Washington University, sees patients in Wisconsin via telemedicine, charging $490 for an initial consultation.

As the former president of the International Lyme and Associated Diseases Society, or ILADS, Shor adheres to diagnoses and treatments that the mainstream Infectious Diseases Society of America, or IDSA, generally rejects. Dr. Paul Auwaerter of Johns Hopkins Medicine, a former president of IDSA, calls physicians who treat patients for chronic Lyme ""antiscience"" and a danger to patients and the medical profession.

""It is disappointing to me that people resort to name-calling from either side,"" said Dr. Elizabeth Maloney, a family physician from Minnesota who helped write the latest guidelines on Lyme disease treatment. ""It’s not helpful, and it does undermine patients’ confidence in our profession as a whole.""

The guidelines issued by IDSA maintain the group’s recommendations against antibiotic treatment for patients with persistent symptoms. It has also removed a previously endorsed term — Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome, or PTLDS — for defining patients with persistent symptoms after short courses of antibiotic therapies.

""They don’t even want to go into that quagmire anymore,"" said Maloney, who leads the Partnership for Tick-Borne Diseases Education. ""They do not really talk about what to do with patients who do not fully recover. It’s kind of a black box.""

The disease is complex. If untreated, Lyme can have wide-ranging effects on skin, joints, nervous system or the heart. The infectious agents attack connective tissue and can move around and ""find their own way to … various parts of the body,"" said Dean Nardelli, an associate professor who studies later-stage Lyme disease at the UW-Milwaukee’s Biomedical Sciences Lab Programs.

In a 2019 article in the journal Antibiotics, Shor said chronic Lyme is ""often dismissed as a fictitious entity."" He and his co-authors consulted more than 250 peer-reviewed articles pointing to ""a multisystem illness with a wide range of symptoms,"" either continuously or intermittently, lasting at least six months.

""Signs and symptoms may wax, wane and migrate,"" they wrote.

Other pathogens to blame?

Shor and his co-authors, including Maloney, propose that the lingering symptoms are caused by several pathogens from the Borrelia burgdorferi family or other tick-borne pathogens.

Nardelli said there’s a variety of symptoms and severity in Lyme disease patients, and those symptoms can be caused by the inflammatory responses against the microbes.

""Inflammation is a huge part of the immune response. It’s one of the frontline defenses we have, and it has this negative connotation, but it is intended for good,"" he said. ""Your immune response (is) trying to kill the bug … and in doing so, can cause damage, essentially.""

Some theories suggest that variants of the Lyme bacteria are resistant to antibiotics. Others argue that chronic Lyme is caused by a powerful immune reaction — or it may even trigger an autoimmune disease. The central neural networks may be altered, having a significant impact on symptoms — or a combination of these factors.

Nardelli is investigating Lyme-related arthritis that persists after treatment with antibiotics. He said science can be a slow process of acquiring new knowledge, and it’s tough for patients who are suffering with no clear answers.

That can lead them to seek out untrustworthy practitioners or fall for costly treatments that don’t work. ""You go out and find doctors that diagnose everything as Lyme disease,"" Nardelli said.

For complicated cases, Maloney said physicians should approach patients as a detective would, whittling away other possibilities until getting to a diagnosis.

""The whole goal is to get people the right diagnosis so they can get the therapy that they need,"" she said.

Freitas said she trusts Shor, who has embraced her IGeneX test results for Lyme and has also diagnosed her as having several afflictions: babesiosis, which has some of the same symptoms as Lyme and can come from the same ticks; bartonella, also known as cat scratch fever; and chronic fatigue syndrome.

Alternate treatments offer relief

Freitas now takes Epsom salt baths Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays and uses an infrared sauna for detoxification, saying it makes her body feel better.

And she now takes 30 pills each day, interspersing antibiotics with herbs and dietary supplements, which cost upwards of $1,200 a month.

""For babesia … I’m taking liquid gold … Mepron,"" said Freitas. ""It's really expensive. It’s 50 bucks for 80 milliliters, which lasts two weeks.""

She gave up dairy, gluten, and sugar to reduce inflammation.

And she meets with Shor monthly online from her house at a charge of $250 per visit, which insurance does not cover.

""It was to me (that) the money is well paid. I’m having peace of mind,"" Freitas said. ""I feel like I’m getting better.""

Freitas said she started gaining back some weight in June. Her mind has become a bit clearer. Her long-term memory seems back a bit, too. ""I’m getting out of the graveyard,"" she said.

Said Oppenheimer to his wife: ""What I’m seeing is you’re better relative to the beginning of (2021), because you’re still not good.""

For Freitas, the struggle for recognition — and relief from her symptoms — continues. She and her husband remodeled their home over the summer, refurbishing their two-story house with a plan to rent out one level to pay for Freitas’ ongoing treatments.

And she still holds out ""a little flame of hope"" of one day becoming a doctor — just like her dad.

This validates wastewater surveillance as a fast and accurate barometer for disease in a population, said Dr Desmond Chua, research fellow at SCELSE and lead author of the study, adding that it should be used as a tool to prevent future pandemics.

Dr Chua said: “Although wastewater surveillance can only pick up asymptomatic and symptomatic cases before clinical confirmation, it can promote the quick ring-fencing of specific affected communities.”

He added: “This can prevent a minor outbreak from devolving into a fully fledged pandemic.”

The study will be published in the Science of The Total Environment on June 1. It analysed Covid-19 variants found in wastewater collected from two treatment plants between September 2021 and May 2022.

The plants serviced around 50 per cent of Singapore’s population as the country was transitioning to living with Covid-19 and lifting mandatory testing for international arrivals.

The team of researchers from NTU, SCELSE and Singapore MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (Smart) manufactured several genetic markers – known as assays – to test for the presence of different Covid-19 variants.

They also manufactured an assay to detect general levels of the Omicron variant, and two to detect specifically the Ba.1 and Ba.2 Omicron subvariants in wastewater.

The scientists were thus able to get an overview of the extent of Covid-19 transmission in the community at the time, and the sub-variant composition in those infected.

In this way, they discovered that the Ba.1 and Ba.2 sub-variants only started spreading in the community after Jan 11, 2021.

This would validate the government’s decision to relax its on-arrival testing policy on Jan 7, 2021, after observing that the Omicron variant was more infectious but less deadly than other Covid-19 strains, and posed less of a threat.

Associate Professor Janelle Thompson at the Asian School of the Environment in NTU, the lead principal investigator of the study, said that analysing wastewater provided evidence that the country’s on-arrival testing policy successfully kept Omicron out of the community until Singapore was ready.

The decision to lift on-arrival testing for Covid-19 was made when more than 80 per cent of the population was vaccinated, and more than 40 per cent of the population had taken their booster shots.

Prof Thompson said: “At the end of the day, the results really line up with the timeline of the policies… Our interest in wastewater surveillance is in using it to inform public policy decisions and to evaluate their efficacy.”","SINGAPORE - Wastewater surveillance made it possible to detect the spread of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 in the community within two days, according to a new study by the Singapore Centre for Environmental Life Sciences Engineering (SCELSE) in Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and National University of Singapore.

UNCTAD’s Global Trade Update published on 17 February shows that in 2021, world trade in goods remained strong and trade in services finally returned to its pre-COVID-19 levels.

“Overall, the value of global trade reached a record level of $28.5 trillion in 2021,” the report says. That’s an increase of 25% on 2020 and 13% higher compared to 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic struck.

While most global trade growth took hold during the first half of 2021, progress continued in the year’s second half.

After a relatively slow third quarter, trade growth picked up again in the fourth quarter, when trade in goods increased by almost $200 billion, achieving a new record of $5.8 trillion.

Meanwhile, trade in services rose by $50 billion to reach $1.6 trillion, just above pre-pandemic levels.

Note: Quarterly growth is the quarter over quarter growth rate of seasonally adjusted values. Annual growth refers to the last four quarters. Figures for Q4 2021 are preliminary. Q1 2022 is a nowcast.

Greater trade growth in developing countries

The report shows that in the fourth quarter 2021, all major trading economies saw imports and exports rise well above pre-pandemic levels in 2019.

But trade in goods increased more strongly in the developing world than in developed countries.

Exports of developing countries were about 30% higher than during the same period in 2020, compared with 15% for wealthier nations.

The growth was higher in commodity-exporting regions, as commodity prices increased. Moreover, South-South trade growth was above the global average, with a 32% year-on-year increase.

Substantial trade growth in most sectors

Except transport equipment, all economic sectors saw a substantial year-over-year increase in the value of their trade during the final quarter of 2021.

“High fuel prices are behind the strong increase in the value of trade of the energy sector,” the report says, “Trade growth was also above average for metals and chemicals.”

As a result of the global shortage of semiconductors, trade growth in communication equipment, road vehicles and precision instruments was subdued.

Forecasts for 2022

The UNCTAD report indicates that trade growth will slow during the first quarter of 2022.

Positive growth rates are expected for both trade in goods and services, albeit only marginally, keeping trade values at levels similar to the last three months of 2021.

“The positive trend for international trade in 2021 was largely the result of increases in commodity prices, subsiding pandemic restrictions and a strong recovery in demand due to economic stimulus packages,” the report says.

“As these trends are likely to abate, international trade trends are expected to normalize during 2022.”

Factors set to shape 2022 world trade

Trade growth in 2022 is likely to be lower than expected, given the macroeconomic trends.

The International Monetary Fund has revised its world economic growth forecast downwards by 0.5 points, the report notes, considering persistent inflation in the United States and concerns related to China’s real estate sector.

It also points to ongoing logistic disruptions and rising energy prices, saying that “efforts to shorten supply chains and to diversify suppliers could affect global trade patterns during 2022.”

On trade flows, the report projects the trend of regionalization to increase because of various trade agreements and regional initiatives, as well as “increasing reliance of geographically closer suppliers.”

Moreover, trade patterns in 2022 are expected to reflect the increasing global demand for products that are environmentally sustainable.

The report also flags the record levels of global debt, warning that concerns over debt sustainability are likely to intensify due to mounting inflationary pressures.

“A significant tightening of financial conditions would heighten pressure on the most highly indebted governments, amplifying vulnerabilities and negatively affecting investments and international trade flows,” the report cautions.","UNCTAD’s Global Trade Update published on 17 February shows that in 2021, world trade in goods remained strong and trade in services finally returned to its pre-COVID-19 levels.
“Overall, the value of global trade reached a record level of $28.5 trillion in 2021,” the report says.
While most global trade growth took hold during the first half of 2021, progress continued in the year’s second half.
After a relatively slow third quarter, trade growth picked up again in the fourth quarter, when trade in goods increased by almost $200 billion, achieving a new record of $5.8 trillion.

According to an organizational release, the federal grant is for increasing awareness of biosecurity and helping prevent the spread of infectious diseases in horses.

The EDCC says it will utilize NADPRP funding to develop tools to “improve disease recognition and practical biosecurity while communicating the importance of biosecurity to all horse industry constituents.” One of the projects the EDCC says it will work toward is creating user-friendly biosecurity information and procedures for distribution throughout the horse community. The EDCC also plans to provide ongoing sources of continuing education for distribution by veterinarians to their clients. In addition, the organization will work to assess the industry’s current level of equine biosecurity knowledge via a survey of horse owners and veterinarians.

“Dealing with COVID-19 has highlighted the need for biosecurity procedures to reduce risk of infection; however, most horse owners are still not fully aware of the threat to their horses from both endemic and foreign animal diseases either at home or when traveling,” said Nathaniel A. White II, DVM, MS, DACVS, EDCC director.

“We need to understand the gaps in biosecurity knowledge. Armed with that information, we will create specific plans for facilities and events, enabling the industry to react to domestic and foreign disease threats,” he continued.","The Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) working with the American Association of Equine Practitioners (AAEP) has been awarded a cooperative agreement from USDA-APHIS National Animal Disease Preparedness and Response Program (NADPRP) for $176,960.

UN experts urge the Gov to reverse the bill: https://t.co/udQ5HWvW2r pic.twitter.com/wFDa0fkTE4 UN Special Procedures UN_SPExperts

“The bill fails to acknowledge the Government’s obligation to ensure protection for migrant and asylum-seeking children, and greatly increases risks of Statelessness, in violation of international law”, she added.

Dangers within

Seeking and enjoying asylum is a fundamental human right, according to the UN experts.

However, the bill does not respect the UK’s obligations under international human rights and refugee law, but instead dismantles a core protection of democratic societies and pushes vulnerable people into dangerous situations.

If passed, it could penalize asylum-seekers and refugees, violating the principle of non-punishment in international law and discriminating between categories of asylum seekers, which is contrary to international law, the experts said.

Match words with actions

They also highlighted the specific risks faced by migrant and refugee women.

Under this bill, women who have experienced gender-based violence can be turned away from the UK rather than be allowed to seek and find safety.

“The Government’s repeated public statements on combating trafficking and modern slavery, must be matched by concrete action to ensure equal protection of the law for all victims of trafficking and modern slavery, without discrimination”, underscored the experts.

‘Arbitrary deprivation’

The experts expressed alarm that the bill would increase the possibility of “arbitrary deprivation of citizenship”, which they reminded, has a troubled history rooted in racism and discrimination, and increases the risk of Statelessness.

“The bill instrumentalizes national security concerns, increasing risks of discrimination and of serious human rights violations, in particular against minorities, migrants and refugees”, they spelled out, urging the Government “to reverse these proposed measures”.

Standing up, speaking out

In November, the experts sent a letter to the UK Government, outlining a range of concerns about the bill.

In addition to Ms. Mullally, the other experts who signed the statement were Felipe González Morales, Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, Fionnuala Ní Aoláin, Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights while countering terrorism and Tomoya Obokata, Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, including its causes and consequences.

Reem Alsalem, Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences also endorsed the statement.

185,185,https://www.interviewmagazine.com/culture/fox-news,Fox News,"Julia Fox called us from bed this afternoon and in a breathless whisper commanded our attention. It’s easy to forget that she was once a dominatrix until she has you on the phone bending to her will.

JULIA FOX: I think I’m going to call you about my date nights weekly, maybe bi-weekly. How does that sound?

INTERVIEW: Good.

FOX: Okay. I’ll send pictures, I’ll tell you stories. And you’ll publish them.

INTERVIEW: Alright.

FOX: Let’s call it “This Week in Fox News.”

INTERVIEW: You’re insane.

FOX: You love it.

INTERVIEW: Where are you right now?

FOX: L.A.

INTERVIEW: What are you wearing today?

FOX: Right now I’m fully naked. I just got back to mine, and I’m wearing yesterday’s makeup. The earrings are Balenciaga. [Laughs]

INTERVIEW: Are you wearing any perfume, Julia?

FOX: No, I haven’t worn perfume in such a long time. I’m all about natural pheromones.

INTERVIEW: Tell us about your night on Wednesday.

FOX: Delilah. I had a date with Madonna, but obviously I invited Ye because they know each other, they work together, and they respect each other as artists. Then Floyd Mayweather, Antonio Brown, and a bunch of other people showed up. So obviously we had to do a photo shoot.

INTERVIEW: Obviously. Who made your Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill! outfit?

FOX: That was custom. My stylists Peri Rosenzweig and Briana Andalore designed it with Ye’s direction. They understood the assignment and they turned me out.

INTERVIEW: Russ Meyer’s Vixen. Have you ever seen the movie?

FOX: Yeah, when I was like 16.

INTERVIEW: What did you eat at Delilah?

FOX: I kept getting up, and every time I came back, what I ordered became something else. I ended up eating a Caesar salad.

INTERVIEW: Were you obsessed?

FOX: I wasn’t obsessed with the Caesar salad. How could you be obsessed with a Caesar salad when you’re sitting next to fucking Madonna?

INTERVIEW: How’s the relationship with Ye evolving?

FOX: You know, I’m so used to being fucked over in relationships, so I keep waiting for him to disappoint me, because he makes very grandiose promises, and it’s like, “How could he ever pull it off with all the other things he has going on?” But he always does. Last night was a testament to that.

INTERVIEW: Do you feel like you’re a muse?

FOX: I’ve always been someone’s muse.

INTERVIEW: What does being a muse mean to you?

FOX: You’re either born a muse, or you’re not.

INTERVIEW: What do you see as your destiny right now?

FOX: Right now, the vibes I’m getting are very much about tolerance, kindness, and love. I’m canceling cancel culture and putting an end to this black-and-white thinking. People shouldn’t be defined by their darkest moment. As humans, we commit violence to each other, we police each other. We’ve created such a hostile environment, especially on the internet. That’s why I don’t read the headlines.

INTERVIEW: You don’t read. Do you not read the comments?

FOX: No. And that’s why I feel like I’m a really good candidate for this position, because a lot of people in my shoes would probably be reading the comments and freaking out. I’m not trying to have everybody love me, I’m just trying to connect with people that are like-minded.

INTERVIEW: So, what was last night like?

FOX: I didn’t really know what was going on. I was just given an address, and it was to this enormous futuristic warehouse in downtown L.A. We went inside, through this tunnel, into a huge room with dim lights. Ye loves to play with light and darkness. He decided to put on Zola, and I was like, “There’s no way that everyone’s going to just stop and watch the movie.” Thirty seconds in, everyone there stopped talking and started watching, yelling commentary, and laughing. Dave Chappelle fucking loved it. It was such a special moment, to include Zola in our narrative.

INTERVIEW: What does Zola mean for your narrative?

FOX: I think it was a moment that he felt really inspired by something that I had shown him. We watched Zola the second time we hung out. From Zola, it was Slave Play in, New York, and now we’re here.

INTERVIEW: Who was there last night?

FOX: Dave Chappelle, Marilyn Manson, Naomi Campbell, the actor from the new Batman, Cam’ron, Jack Donoghue from Salem, Andrew Richardson from Richardson magazine, Richie Shazam, all my friends came. Richie ate sashimi with Marilyn Manson and they had a really nice heart-to-heart.

INTERVIEW: What were you wearing?

FOX: I was wearing Diesel, and a Balenciaga bag and boots. The moto pants are Diesel and the top is Margiela.

INTERVIEW: What did you do after the movie?

FOX: There was a music video shoot, a Pusha T video shoot. Ye did his thing because he’s in the song with Pusha. Then we went back to the hotel and the paparazzi have been following me ever since.

INTERVIEW: If you had to describe the paparazzi as an animal or a creature, how would you describe them?

FOX: They’re like parasites, or some sort of virus you catch.

INTERVIEW: What do you and Ye talk about when you’re alone?

FOX: Ideas. That’s what’s so exciting about being in the vicinity of someone who’s operating at the level that he is. These seemingly crazy ideas, he can make them come to life.

INTERVIEW: What’s the wildest thing he’s dreamed up that you’ve seen come to life between you two?

FOX: My transformation. After meeting him, a couple days later, all my shit was in boxes, gone. It was so cathartic. It wasn’t like I was just packing up my old clothes, it was like I was packing up my old life. I was like making that very conscious decision to really put everything in the box. To let go of the past.

INTERVIEW: We’re learning on Fox News that you boxed your life up and you’re in Ye world now?

FOX: Yeah, let’s be honest. Why not?

INTERVIEW: That’s what we do on Fox News.

FOX: I’m really surrendering. For someone like me who’s such a control freak and always so used to taking care of myself, to just let go and be taken care of is foreign at this point in life. I’ve been the primary caretaker of everyone for so long, so it’s a new sensation, but honestly, I think I deserve it. Even a month ago, I was so fucking like…not getting along with my son’s father, or not having help. It was just me alone. I was so tired and everything was work. I just remember being like, “I know that there’s going to be a reward for this, like this is so fucking miserable that I know that I know something good will come of this if I just hang in there.” And then a few days later there I am with Ye, and it was the most instant natural organic attraction and connection. I just feel really safe with him. It’s a redemption story.","JULIA FOX: I think I’m going to call you about my date nights weekly, maybe bi-weekly.

How do tennis rankings work?

Women's tennis world rankings are calculated by the WTA, who award points based on a player's performance at particular tournaments.

The further a player progresses in a sanctioned event, the more points they will be awarded.

Grand slams provide the most points with 2000 awarded to the winner and 1200 to the runner-up.

Points picked up from each tournament last for one year with rankings updated each week.

When are tennis rankings updated?

Both the ATP and WTA update their rankings every Monday when tournaments aren't running.

So in general you can expect weekly updates aside from when Grand Slams are being competed.","The mantle of world No.1 in tennis is something every player aspires for but few ever achieve.

It can appear all year round, remaining for as long as the plant is in leaf and once it takes hold it can seriously weaken your rose.

If you're thinking of planting roses this year, however, there's no need to despair because it rarely kills plants and it is treatable. In fact there are many methods of knocking it back and preventing its spread, including chemical sprays, practical measures and organic solutions

There is even a bizarre-sounding ‘anecdotal’ measure involving corn meal that I tried in spring last year, because I have several roses in the garden and they inevitably fall foul of black spot to some degree. While the corn meal didn’t completely prevent black spot, it did delay it on the rose I was experimenting with until well into the summer, so I plan to try it again this year with more rigorous application.

What does rose black spot look like?

Rose black spot is easy to identify. It usually starts as dark or purple blotches on the upper surface of a leaf. These may turn yellow at the edges, and the leaf will eventually fall, although sometimes the spots stay small and the foliage stays on the plants. Young stems may also be affected with scabby, dark blisters.

If a rose is very badly infected the disease can check its growth and reduce its vigor.

What causes rose black spot?

The culprit is a fungal disease called Diplocarpon rosae. Unfortunately it is genetically diverse so new strains are continually appearing.

This means that although rose breeders are always coming up with new varieties that are resistant to the disease, their protection fails to last as new strains of the pathogen evolve.

Preventing rose black spot

Once a rose has black spot it is hard to get rid of the problem because the spores from fallen leaves linger in the soil and reinfect the plant by being splashed up by rain. However, you can give your rose the best chance of staying healthy by giving it the right care and attention.

Fungal diseases such as black spot and powdery mildew thrive in areas where plants are crammed in together and there is poor airflow, leading to still, warm, damp conditions. Prevent this by making sure plants in your rose garden have room to grow properly, so air can move between them.

As well as knowing when to fertilize roses, make sure you give them the right amount of rose fertilizer, like this Great Big Roses soil and fertilizer booster from Amazon (opens in new tab), and water them correctly. Plants that grow healthily are less likely to succumb to pests and disease, and if they do develop problems they are better equipped to recover afterwards.

Mulching generously in spring and fall is also important. It can be wood chip mulch, like this Mighty 109 cedar wood chip mulch from Amazon (opens in new tab), well-rotted homemade compost or farmyard manure from your local farm, stables, garden store or online. Something like this Black Kow composted cow manure fertilizer from Amazon (opens in new tab) would be suitable.

The right types of mulch will feed the soil and roots, but also bury any black spot spores so they are less likely to be splashed back up in rain to re-infect a treated plant.

How to treat rose black spot

If a rose has had black spot one year it increases the chance of it returning the next. To try and prevent it, mulch around your plant in spring and start spraying with a plant fungicide as soon as the new leaves start to emerge. You may need to do this throughout the growing season to keep your plant healthy.

There are many fungicides available. Some are concentrate and need letting down, such as BioAdvanced Disease Control for roses, plants and shrubs on Amazon (opens in new tab). Others come as ready-to-use sprays and will tackle pests at the same time, including this BioAdvanced 3-In-1 Insect, Disease and Mite Control one, also on Amazon (opens in new tab).

If black spot does appear despite treatments, cut off the affected leaves with sharp garden snips or remove them by hand to make way for healthy new growth.

Also examine the soil around the plant and collect up any fallen leaves showing signs of black spot. Never compost diseased leaves as the spores will thrive in your compost heap and be spread around the yard.

Instead, put diseased plant material in the trash or burn it, then clean your pruning shears to prevent the disease being transmitted to other roses when you deadhead or prune them.

In the fall, collect up all fallen rose leaves and mulch around the plant to bury the spores. When pruning roses that have been infected by black spot, add the cut stems to the trash or burn them, never add them to the compost heap.

Natural treatments for rose black spot

If you prefer not to use chemicals you need to be extremely diligent with your plant care, mulching, removing diseased leaves and feeding and watering to keep your plants as healthy as possible.

Organic sprays against rose black spot are available and include Bonide Rose Rx Multi-Purpose Fungicide, Insecticide and Miticide on Amazon (opens in new tab), which comes as concentrate as well as a ready-to-use spray and is made with a natural disinfectant called Neem. Neem is also widely used in homemade bug sprays for keeping pests away from plants.

You could also try Earth's Ally Disease Control Concentrate (opens in new tab) (also on Amazon) which also works against powdery mildew and tomato blight.

Sulfur can also be used in organic gardens to combat fungal diseases, and copper fungicide sprays like this Bonide Captain Jack's Copper Fungicide at Walmart (opens in new tab) are also effective.

Some household products can also be used against rose black spot. Baking soda, which has been used for generations as a household cleaner, changes the pH level of the leaves making it harder for the fungal spores to adhere. Make a solution of a teaspoon of baking soda mixed with a quart of water and spray it thickly onto the roses every week and after rain.

There is also anecdotal evidence that cornmeal can help delay rose black spot. It contains a fungus called Trichoderma that is harmless to humans but kills black spot pathogens. Apply it around your rose in spring and fork it into the soil.

Rose varieties resistant to black spot

Although there are some varieties of roses that are resistant to black spot, the fungus mutates and produces new strains so swiftly that complete protection may only last a few seasons.

However, resistant roses may still recover faster and better from attacks of the disease, so consider these options if you are designing a rose garden:

FAQs

How does rose black spot spread? Rose black spot is a fungal disease. It is spread by spores that travel in water, whether it is from the gardener watering their plants, humidity and rainfall. If the spores fall onto the soil they will stay there and be splashed back onto the plant when it is watered or when it rains. Mulching in spring and fall traps the spores in the soil so they can't reinfect the plant.

Can rose black spot affect other plants? Although many varieties of plants get a variation of black spot disease, it is not the same pathogen as rose black spot. All black spot diseases are fungal, and can be treated with good garden hygiene and plant care, and by using a general fungicide such as this Garden Safe fungicide from Amazon (opens in new tab).

Although it can be disappointing to discover that your favorite rose is suffering from rose black spot, it doesn't have to mean that your plant will die from this common disease.

By following the best treatment methods you can nurse it back to health, plus take precautions to prevent it spreading to other roses in your flower beds.","What does rose black spot look like?

LONDON: Even mild infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can lead to shrinkage in brain areas related to smell, according to a study led by researchers at the University of Oxford.

The research, published in the journal Nature on Monday, looked at changes to the brain on average 4.5 months after mild SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Using data from 785 participants in the UK Biobank, a large-scale biomedical database and research resource, the researchers found tissue damage and greater shrinkage in brain areas related to smell.

This new insight into the damaging effects of COVID-19 will contribute to the overall understanding of how the disease spreads through the central nervous system, the researchers said.

Whether these effects persist in the long term, or are partially reversed, requires further investigation, they said.

Previous studies have shown that COVID-19 may cause brain-related abnormalities, but most studies have focused on hospitalised patients with severe disease, and have been limited to post-infection data.

The researchers noted that the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the brain in milder cases were unknown until now, and investigating these cases could reveal possible mechanisms that contribute to brain disease or damage.

The study participants were aged 51-81 and underwent two brain scans, on average 38 months apart, as well as cognitive tests.

A total of 401 participants tested positive for infection with SARS-CoV-2 between their two scans, of which 15 were hospitalised.

The remaining 384 individuals, who did not get infected, were similar to the infected group in age, sex, and many risk factors, including blood pressure, obesity, smoking, socio-economic status and diabetes.

The study identified a number of effects, on average 4.5 months following infection, including a greater reduction in grey matter thickness in the regions of the brain associated with smell.

The participants who had COVID-19 also displayed evidence of greater tissue damage in regions connected with the primary olfactory cortex, an area linked to smell, and a reduction in whole brain size.

These effects ranged from 0.2 to 2 per cent additional change compared with the participants who had not been infected.

On average, the participants who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 also showed greater cognitive decline between their two scans, associated with the atrophy of a specific part of the cerebellum, a brain structure linked to cognition.

The authors studied people who developed pneumonia not related to COVID-19, showing that the changes were specific to COVID-19, and not due to the generic effects of contracting a respiratory illness.

""Using the UK Biobank resource, we were in a unique position to look at changes that took place in the brain following mild-as opposed to more moderate or severe-SARS-CoV-2 infection,"" said Professor Gwenaelle Douaud, lead author of the study.

""Despite the infection being mild for 96 per cent of our participants, we saw a greater loss of grey matter volume, and greater tissue damage in the infected participants, on average 4.5 months after infection,"" Douaud said.

The researchers also showed a greater decline in their mental abilities to perform complex tasks, and this mental worsening was partly related to these brain abnormalities.

""Another strength of this study is that it investigated the same people at two different times,"" said Professor Stephen Smith, senior author on the study, from Oxford's Wellcome Centre for Integrative Neuroimaging.

""The fact that we have the pre-infection scan helps us distinguish brain changes related to the infection from differences that may have pre-existed in their brains,"" Smith added.

LONDON: Even mild infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can lead to shrinkage in brain areas related to smell, according to a study led by researchers at the University of Oxford. The research, published in the journal Nature on Monday, looked at changes to the brain on average 4.5 months after mild SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using data from 785 participants in the UK Biobank, a large-scale biomedical database and research resource, the researchers found tissue damage and greater shrinkage in brain areas related to smell.googletag.cmd.push(function() {googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-8052921-2'); }); This new insight into the damaging effects of COVID-19 will contribute to the overall understanding of how the disease spreads through the central nervous system, the researchers said. Whether these effects persist in the long term, or are partially reversed, requires further investigation, they said. Previous studies have shown that COVID-19 may cause brain-related abnormalities, but most studies have focused on hospitalised patients with severe disease, and have been limited to post-infection data. The researchers noted that the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the brain in milder cases were unknown until now, and investigating these cases could reveal possible mechanisms that contribute to brain disease or damage. The study participants were aged 51-81 and underwent two brain scans, on average 38 months apart, as well as cognitive tests. A total of 401 participants tested positive for infection with SARS-CoV-2 between their two scans, of which 15 were hospitalised. The remaining 384 individuals, who did not get infected, were similar to the infected group in age, sex, and many risk factors, including blood pressure, obesity, smoking, socio-economic status and diabetes. The study identified a number of effects, on average 4.5 months following infection, including a greater reduction in grey matter thickness in the regions of the brain associated with smell. The participants who had COVID-19 also displayed evidence of greater tissue damage in regions connected with the primary olfactory cortex, an area linked to smell, and a reduction in whole brain size. These effects ranged from 0.2 to 2 per cent additional change compared with the participants who had not been infected. On average, the participants who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 also showed greater cognitive decline between their two scans, associated with the atrophy of a specific part of the cerebellum, a brain structure linked to cognition.

NEW YORK, Feb 24 (Reuters) - After her mother and sister died within 30 days from heart disease, Stephanie Johnson made it her mission to fight against the killer often brought on by high blood pressure.

Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States and the No. 1 killer of Black women, with an annual toll of nearly 50,000, according to the American Heart Association (AHA).

Nearly half of Black women aged over 20 have heart disease, but most are unaware of the risks.

Johnson created Release the Pressure (RTP), a coalition to raise awareness among Black women.

""African Americans, Black Americans are 30% more likely to die from heart disease than non-Hispanic whites,"" said Johnson, American Medical Association's vice president of communications and product strategies.

""High blood pressure increases the risk of heart disease because the heart is working harder,"" explained Dr. Peggy Roberts, founder and chief executive of Trust Women's Healthcare.

Stroke, heart attack, aneurysm and heart arrhythmia are major risks. Stress from racism can raise blood pressure.

""On top of all the social stressors that we have to deal with being Black in America, it's too much,"" Johnson said.

Nutritionist Coach Gessie Thompson, founder of TheDetoxNow.com, nearly died in 2020 after her blood pressure spiked from stress. She is providing digital heart health kits and helping with RTP's goal to send out 100,000 free validated blood pressure cuffs to Black women by 2027.

Home testing can be more accurate than in a doctor's office where nerves and other factors can skew a reading.

Despite years of headaches and multiple miscarriages, Nichola Hamilton, 38, only knew she had high blood pressure on her first visit with Dr. Roberts. She got a reading of 160 over 100. Less than 120 over 80 is considered normal but pressure above 130/80 requires focused treatment.

""It's really important that we have the information as a community to be able to advocate for ourselves,"" said Dr. Aletha Maybank, chief health equity officer and senior vice president of the American Medical Association.

The patient said she consulted doctors at several hospitals in the past 8 years but in vain until this cutting-edge medication

An Emirati woman, who has been suffering from a complex autoimmune disease for years, is relieved following a unique treatment at a hospital in Al Ain. Doctors from the rheumatology department at Tawam Hospital successfully treated Sameeha with a new medicine for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

Dr Khalid Alnaqbi, consultant and chief of the rheumatology department, Tawam Hospital and adjunct associate professor at the UAE University, said Sameeha’s disease was uncontrolled for several years despite trying different medications.

“Lupus disease is a non-communicable autoimmune disease that may affect any part of the body due to antibodies produced by the body against certain tissues. The disease affects more females than males and may affect all ages, but it is often diagnosed in the 15 to 45 age group.”

The new drug has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and the UAE’s Ministry of Health and Prevention based on studies from various countries around the world. The rheumatology department provided this medicine at the infusion clinic with cutting-edge medication for lupus.

“The cause of the disease is still unknown but many factors increase the likelihood of disease development such as genetic predisposition, ultraviolet light, hormonal imbalance, smoking, air pollution, obesity, post-traumatic stress, vitamin D deficiency, interferon, viruses, microbiome and side effects of some medicines,” Dr Alnaqbi added.

Lupus may affect different parts of the body. Symptoms may be mild or moderate, such as rash, excessive hair loss, headache unresponsive to painkillers, arthritis, low cell counts (white cells, red cells, or platelets), Raynaud’s phenomenon (blue fingers or toes upon exposure to cold or during periods of psychological stress) or dry eyes. Also, symptoms may be severe, affecting blood vessels, the liver, the kidney or the nervous system.

Sameeha said that she consulted doctors at several hospitals in the past 8 years but in vain until she contacted Dr Alnaqbi.

“I did not discuss my disease with my family or close friends. I was diagnosed 8 years ago. I saw different doctors in many hospitals. I then decided to seek medical advice from Dr Khalid Alnaqbi at Al Ain hospital. I followed up in his clinic at Tawam hospital. I was treated with all available medications due to difficulty controlling my lupus, and I had to keep taking many drugs including steroids.”

Sameeha is thankful to Dr Alnaqbi and his medical team for the exceptional care offered to her.

“Living with this disease has been challenging, but the support from Dr Khalid and his team helped me tremendously to cope up. I’m glad I finally stopped taking steroids after years of taking it.”

Tawam Hospital is part of the Abu Dhabi Health Services Company (SEHA) and the biggest healthcare network and a subsidiary of the PureHealth Group – the UAE’s largest integrated healthcare platform. Treatment of lupus is available at SEHA healthcare facilities.

Dr Alnaqbi emphasised the importance of adherence to medications, doctor’s advice, clinic appointments, and follow-up tests in order to avoid complications of the disease such as kidney failure, stroke, blood clot, bleeding in the lungs, and inflammation of the tissue surrounding the heart or heart muscle, and pregnancy complications.

192,192,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/bird-flu-alarm-outbreaks-poultry-egg-producers-vaccines-3286086,Bird flu alarm drives world towards once-shunned vaccines,"CASTELNAU-TURSAN, France: French duck farmer Herve Dupouy has culled his flock four times since 2015 to stop the spread of bird flu but as a wave of deadly outbreaks nears his farm once again, he says it's time to accept a solution once considered taboo: Vaccination.

""The goal is that our animals don't fall ill and that they don't spread the virus,"" Dupouy said on his farm in Castelneu-Tursan in southwestern France. ""Our job as farmers is not to gather dead animals.""

Like Dupouy, more and more governments around the world are reconsidering their opposition to vaccines as culling birds or locking them inside has failed to prevent bird flu returning to decimate commercial flocks year after year.

Reuters spoke to senior officials in the world's largest poultry and egg producers, along with vaccine makers and poultry companies. They all said there had been a marked shift in the approach to vaccines globally due to the severity of this year's bird flu outbreak, though the biggest exporter of poultry meat, the United States, told Reuters it remains reluctant.

Besides the cost of culling millions of chickens, ducks, turkeys and geese there is also a growing fear among scientists and governments that if the virus becomes endemic, the chances of it mutating and spreading to humans will only increase.

""That's why every country in the world is worried about bird flu,"" French agriculture minister Marc Fesneau said.

""There's no reason to panic but we must learn from history on these subjects. This is why we are looking into vaccinations at the global level,"" he told Reuters.

Most of the world's biggest poultry producers have resisted vaccinations due to concerns they could mask the spread of bird flu and hit exports to countries that have banned vaccinated poultry on fears infected birds could slip through the net.

But since early last year, bird flu, or avian influenza, has ravaged farms around the world, leading to the deaths of more than 200 million birds because of the disease or mass culls, the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) told Reuters.

The mass culls last year also sent the price of eggs sky-rocketing, contributing to the global food crisis.

US HOLDS OUT

Mexico started emergency vaccinations last year while Ecuador said this month it planned to inoculate more than 2 million birds after the virus infected a 9-year-old girl.

France is on track to start vaccinating poultry in September, agriculture minister Fesneau told Reuters, before the return of migrating wild birds that can infect farms.

The EU, meanwhile, agreed last year to implement a vaccine strategy across its 27 member states.

Brussels has also normalised its poultry vaccination rules, which are due to come into force next month. They will ensure poultry products and day-old chicks can be traded freely within the bloc, a European Commission spokesperson told Reuters.

China, which consumes most of its poultry production domestically, has been vaccinating against avian influenza for nearly 20 years and has managed to sharply reduce outbreaks.","""The goal is that our animals don't fall ill and that they don't spread the virus,"" Dupouy said on his farm in Castelneu-Tursan in southwestern France.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), kidney disease has risen from being the 13th leading cause of death to the 10th. In 2019, 1.3 million people died from kidney disease, rising from 813,000 in 2000. But it’s often possible to slow or stop kidney disease from progressing to kidney failure if it’s detected and treated early.

Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is a coenzyme, a helper molecule, found in every single living cell. In addition to regulating various metabolic pathways, it is also involved in DNA repair and immune cell function. It’s crucial to maintaining metabolic homeostasis (equilibrium) through its effect on mitochondria, the cell’s power generators. Without sufficient levels of NAD+, our cells wouldn’t be able to generate the energy necessary to carry out their metabolic functions.

The kidney’s tubule cells require a lot of mitochondria-produced energy to perform their function, reabsorbing essential nutrients and excreting waste products and toxins. When the mitochondria in those cells are damaged, an inflammatory response is triggered that can result in kidney disease, leading to a build-up of fluid, electrolytes, and waste in the body.

Now, researchers at the University of Pennsylvania have used metabolomics – the study of small molecules found in blood and urine – to map metabolite changes in healthy and diseased mouse and human kidneys. Metabolites are very small molecules produced during metabolism; measuring them gives an insight into a person’s health status. This is the first time human samples have been used in metabolomic studies.

The researchers tested kidney samples from a healthy control group against samples from patients with diabetic kidney disease or kidney disease caused by high blood pressure (hypertension). They found that, in the diseased kidneys, NAD+ levels were significantly lower. To examine the disease mechanism underlying these differences, they conducted RNA-sequencing on the samples.

Finding a correlation between NAD+ levels and mitochondrial gene expression, the researchers concluded that lower NAD+ levels were a key feature of human kidney disease.

Moreover, when mice were given an over-the-counter supplement of NAD+ precursors, nicotinamide riboside or nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), to boost NAD+ levels, the tubule cell’s mitochondria were protected from damage, thereby preventing the progression to kidney disease.

“We hope that this research can lead to improved care in the future,” said Katalin Susztak, co-lead author of the study. “So when patients have metabolite changes, they can receive treatment before kidney disorders arise.”

The researchers hope their study will lead to further studies into the role of metabolites in kidney disease and the development of new methods of prevention and treatment.

“Identifying these downstream mechanisms that are sensitive to NAD+ is critical to understanding which conditions may benefit from NAD+ supplementation,” said Joseph Baur, co-lead author of the study.

The study was published in the journal Nature Metabolism.

On the other hand, Pharmaceutical industry data estimates that, collectively, there are 400 million people suffering from rare disease and there are 7,000 different rare diseases, which seems not so rare as these figures are even higher than global cancer statistics.

Rare disease patients are among millions who experienced dangerous delays and even deprived access to life saving treatments because of supply disruptions and healthcare facilities and manpower that were redeployed to fight the pandemic – a sad consequence that reflects what the Department of Health has admitted is the country’s “disjointed” public health system that needs to be addressed with urgency.

In last week’s Stratbase ADR institute’s hybrid forum organized in partnership with UHC Watch and the Philippine Society of Orphan Disorders, implementation gaps of Rare Disease Act (Republic Act 10747), passed in 2016, were aired by patient groups, health advocates, and the DOH.

Stratbase ADRi president, Prof. Victor Andres “Dindo” Manhit. in his opening statement pointed out after seven years since the law’s passage, patients and other stakeholder groups are still clamoring for government support in terms of adequate funding and proper implementation of the Integrated Rare Diseases Management Program Strategic Plan.

“The challenges of rare disease patients continue and need to be addressed — among these are the institutionalization of government support, increase access to available services and expansion of the scope of the rare diseases which is aligned with the Rare Disease Law,” Prof Manhit said.

The Role of the DOH as the lead agency was emphasized by UHC Watch Healthcare and Education Convenor, Alvin Manalansan.

In particular, he appealed for a faster Health Technology Assessment process for rare disease health technologies and to explore innovative financing mechanisms that will support patients in accessing diagnostic services and treatment.

Pharmaceutical and Healthcare Association of the Philippines Healthcare Policy Director Lourdes Desiree Cembrano raised the need to raise public awareness pointing to low understanding, the limited capacity for detection and management, and the lack of tools for patient navigation and registries.

Among her recommendations were for stakeholders to engage in quad-media campaigns, continuing medical education across various healthcare professionals, and to establish a rare disease community for patient navigation mechanisms.

Ms. Cembrano stressed on the need to have more agility and flexibility in regulatory processes citing US PhRMA data showing only 11 percent of new medicines are made available in the Philippines with a delay of three years.

She appealed for an expedited FDA registration pathway and ‘Green lanes’ for Bureau of Customs release.

Philippine Society for Orphan Disorders President Ms. Cynthia Magdaraog expressed hope with the development of new technologies and medicines and vowed to initiate more engagements to access financial and psychological support for families living with rare disease.

We call on our legislators support this important law with enough budget allocation to enable the DOH to address the challenges raised by rare disease stakeholders in the true spirit of Universal Health Care for all

Dr. Manuel V. Vallesteros, DOH Division Chief of Disease Prevention and Control Bureau-Child, Adolescent and Maternal Health. said they will be developing a life stage-based medium term strategic plan to integrate all existing strategies including the rare disease program.

“The DOH will ensure the proactive engagement with the concerned institutes of the University of the Philippines – National Institutes of Health and various medical societies to help us jumpstart the development of Clinical Practice Guidelines” Dr. Vallesteros said.

Scoliosis Philippines Support Group Inc. Founder and President, Amanda Bonife-Kiamko discussed the value of partnerships with various government agencies, private sector, and other NGOs in conducting patient empowerment, capacity building, strategic planning, and policy workshops.

She cited PAPO’s recommendations to have a citizen representative from the patient groups, and representatives from local health workers in the HTA Council. Furthermore, there should be a separate track for HTA process on rare diseases and cancers, and continued education and capacity building to be able to submit topic nomination.

Dr. Celeste Mae Campomanes of the Philippine College of Chest Physicians said what is needed now is to arm our general practitioners and other doctors to entertain the possibility of Interstitial Lung Disease so that they can refer patients to specialty centers.

Dr. Marita Tolentino-Reyes, Chairperson of the HTA Council identified challenges on the prioritization of rare diseases such as the lack of local data on burden of illness, healthcare costs, unharmonized list of international and local rare diseases, lack of local studies on clinical efficacy, effectiveness and safety, high costs of innovative drugs, and the lack of data on prevalence and access to care in subpopulations.

The unanimous consensus or the forum is to proceed with the organization of a “Rare Disease Coalition” to campaign for adequate funding and to ensure the implementation of the Rare Disease Act.

The findings reveal important insights into how different countries' research establishments respond to disease outbreaks and could be useful for planning responses to future pandemics.

The study showed that countries with larger economies generated more 3D structure determinations for the protein components of coronaviruses, although there were many outliers. For example, some advanced and prosperous countries published few or no coronavirus structures while some countries strongly affected by COVID-19 published far more such structures than would be expected based on their populations and economies.

Manfred Philipp, professor emeritus at the City University of New York, will present the new research at Discover BMB, the annual meeting of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, March 25–28 in Seattle.

The 3D structures of proteins, such as those that make up coronaviruses, are determined using techniques such as X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance. This information is then deposited into the Protein Data Bank (PDB) database so that it can be used to develop new drug treatments and new vaccines. Protein structure information is also key for understanding how viruses infect cells and interact with our immune system.

“We asked ourselves how different countries respond to disease, not in terms of treatment and medical care, but in terms of the research needed to study those diseases and to develop new treatments,” said Philipp. “Structure determinations provide a clear metric in terms of research response without any vagaries of interpretation.”

Although a great deal of research has examined levels of coronavirus research funding in various countries, most of this work has focused either on coronavirus-related patents or financial inputs. However, relating research to patents is complex, in part, because some nonprofits perform considerable amounts of research but rarely apply for patents while some patent-generating organizations don’t conduct a lot of research. Financial-based analyses don’t provide a complete picture because it is difficult to capture both public and private funds. Also, private research funds are not always publicly disclosed and some funds that are reported may be used for administrative and overhead costs instead of directly for research.

“Because we did not look at levels research funding, we didn’t have to figure out how much research funding was devoted to disease and how much to something else,” said Philipp. “Our metric only sees research successes and provides a clear indication of the amount of research applied to this topic alone.”

In the work, the researchers collected and cataloged 3D structure determinations for all proteins and nucleic acids that are components of coronaviruses. This included viruses from animal infections as well as those responsible for the 2003 SARS epidemic in Asia, the 2012 MERS epidemic in the Middle East, the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic and other coronaviruses that have been studied.

Of the approximately 40 countries the researchers examined, the United States, United Kingdom and China had the highest number of protein structures. They found that population size contributed very little to the number of coronavirus protein deposits while countries with a higher GDP did tend to deposit more protein structures. The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases was positively associated with the number of PDB deposits per country, especially in the U.S. Although South Africa and Brazil are not in the top 10 research-producing countries, they had a high number of COVID-19 cases and PDB deposits, suggesting that the high number of cases experienced in these countries influenced their research output.

“Our research on the country distribution of coronavirus-related structure determinations is intended to give research administrators in various countries the tools to redirect research funds in the most productive direction,” said Philipp. “For example, it can help countries with large research budgets but few if any structure determinations to redirect the focus of their research. This should not be the only such metric, but it is a key metric since it is independent of administrative and overhead costs.”

Next, the researchers plan to examine whether the number of structure publications for coronaviruses will continue to increase as the COVID-19 pandemic subsides and whether the countries that have led in depositing coronavirus structures into the PDB will continue to lead.

Manfred Philipp will present this research from 4:30–6:30 p.m. PDT on Sunday, March 26, in Exhibit Hall 4AB of the Seattle Convention Center (Poster Board No. 177) (abstract).

198,198,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/magnesium-threonate,"Magnesium threonate: Benefits, side effects, dosage, and more","Magnesium threonate is a form of the essential mineral magnesium. The body requires magnesium for various functions, including protein synthesis, glucose control, and nerve function. Evidence suggests an individual may benefit from a reduced risk of dementia and other age-related diseases if they have a high intake or circulating levels of magnesium. This is potentially due to the importance of magnesium to the brain and nerves. This article looks at magnesium threonate, its benefits, and its possible side effects. It also explores the importance of magnesium in the body and the symptoms an individual may experience with magnesium deficiency.

What is magnesium threonate? Share on Pinterest Adriana Duduleanu/EyeEm/Getty Images Magnesium threonate, or magnesium L-threonate , is a synthesized form of magnesium. Chemically, it is a salt that forms when a manufacturer combines magnesium with threonic acid. This acid is a product of the metabolic breakdown of vitamin C. The body can easily absorb magnesium threonate. Some animal studies have found that magnesium threonate is more effective at increasing magnesium ions in the brain and improving cognitive function than magnesium sulfate. Therefore, doctors may recommend magnesium L-threonate to normalize an individual’s magnesium levels and for potential benefits to the brain.

Benefits As magnesium L-threonate can readily elevate magnesium levels in the brain, it has the potential to improve cognitive function. However, research is still in the early stages and mainly involves animal models. For example, a 2020 study on zebrafish found that magnesium threonate helps protect against brain cell death and preserve cognitive function. Similarly, a 2019 study using a mouse model of Parkinson’s disease found that magnesium threonate successfully elevated magnesium in cerebrospinal fluid and protected against motor deficits and dopamine neuron loss. Magnesium threonate could have benefits for memory and nerve pain.

Side effects If an individual ingests high levels of magnesium from food, it generally does not pose a risk to their health. However, taking a magnesium threonate supplement, or another supplemental form of magnesium, could cause side effects, including: diarrhea

nausea

abdominal cramping Ingesting more than 5,000 milligrams (mg) of magnesium each day can cause magnesium toxicity, leading to symptoms such as: low blood pressure

urine retention

lethargy

muscle weakness

nausea and vomiting

difficulty breathing

heart problems

Dosage Currently, no recommended daily allowance exists for magnesium L-threonate. However, many companies sell magnesium L-threonate supplements providing around 1500–2000 mg per dose. Magnesium intake recommendations vary. The recommended dietary allowances (RDAs) for males and females over 31 years old are 420 mg and 320 mg, respectively. However, according to manufacturers, 2000 mg of magnesium L-threonate contains only 144 mg of elemental magnesium. Learn more about foods high in magnesium here.

Why do we need magnesium in the body? Magnesium is a mineral that is abundant in the body and many foods. Magnesium is crucial for bodily processes and is involved in over 300 enzyme reactions. It is essential for: protein synthesis

brain function

muscle and nerve function

blood sugar control

blood pressure regulation

energy production

glycolysis, the breakdown of glucose to produce energy

DNA synthesis

bone development

calcium and potassium transport Learn more about why we need magnesium here.

Magnesium deficiency In healthy individuals with a regular dietary intake, magnesium deficiency is uncommon . This is because the kidneys limit how much magnesium they excrete from the body if there is not enough. However, people may develop a magnesium deficiency if they eat a diet low in magnesium, have alcohol use disorder, take certain medications, or have certain other health conditions. Early symptoms of magnesium deficiency include: loss of appetite

nausea

vomiting

tiredness

weakness If the deficiency continues, a person may develop: numbness

tingling sensations

muscle cramps

seizure

abnormal heart rhythm In severe cases, the individual may also develop low serum calcium or potassium levels because of the disruption to how their body manages mineral homeostasis or balance. Learn more about magnesium deficiency here.

Alternative supplements Various alternative supplements may have the potential to boost an individual’s cognitive function. Fish oils Fish oil supplements contain high levels of the omega-3 fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Research indicates that these fatty acids have various health benefits, particularly for the brain. DHA helps with brain structure and function, while EPA has anti-inflammatory effects that could safeguard the brain from the effects of aging. Learn more about fish oils here. Resveratrol Various foods contain the antioxidant resveratrol. These include chocolate, peanuts, red wine, and purple and red fruit skins, such as blueberries and raspberries. Some research indicates that taking resveratrol supplements could help support a part of the brain called the hippocampus. The hippocampus is involved in memory. Therefore, resveratrol could help prevent age-related decline in brain function. Learn more about resveratrol here. Ginkgo biloba This herbal supplement comes from the Ginkgo biloba tree and is one of the most widely used in the world. Its proponents believe it can help with dementia, cardiovascular disease, and sexual dysfunction. Some research indicates that ginkgo supplements can help slow age-related cognitive decline and improve memory and thinking skills. However, overall, the results from studies evaluating its effects are mixed. Learn more about ginkgo here. Acetyl-L-carnitine The body naturally produces the amino acid acetyl-L-carnitine, which contributes to energy production. Manufacturers claim that using acetyl-L-carnitine supplements can help with memory and feelings of alertness. Animal studies have suggested that acetyl-L-carnitine supplements could increase the antioxidant defenses in the brain and potentially combat age-related decreases in cognitive function. Additionally, human research indicates it may be valuable for improving brain function in people with dementia or Alzheimer’s disease. However, its role is still unclear.","This article looks at magnesium threonate, its benefits, and its possible side effects.

New pre-clinical research from the Université Laval Faculty of Medicine and CHU de Québec–Université Laval Research Centre showed genetically mutating human cells could avoid Alzheimer’s disease.

Researchers from the Université Laval Faculty of Medicine and CHU de Québec–Université Laval Research Centre, both Canada, have successfully edited the genome of human cells grown in vitro to introduce a mutation that could provide protection against Alzheimer’s disease in patients. The details of this breakthrough were recently published in The CRISPR Journal.

“Some genetic mutations increase the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease, but there is a mutation that reduces this risk,” said lead author Professor Jacques-P Tremblay. “This is a rare mutation identified in 2012 in the Icelandic population. The mutation has no known disadvantage for those who carry it and reduces the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. Using an improved version of the CRISPR gene editing tool, we have been able to edit the genome of human cells to insert this mutation.”

The brains of Alzheimer’s patients have amyloid plaques which cause neuron death due to their toxicity levels. These plaques are formed when the amyloid precursor protein is cleaved by an enzyme called beta-secretase. “The Icelandic mutation makes it harder for this enzyme to cleave the amyloid precursor protein. As a result, the formation of amyloid plaques is reduced,” explained Tremblay.

Theoretically, introducing the Icelandic mutation into the genome of people at risk of developing Alzheimer’s could prevent or slow the progression of the disease. “Unfortunately, we cannot go back and repair the damage that caused neurons to die,” said Tremblay. “The treatment would therefore be particularly suitable for people from families affected by the hereditary form of the disease, which manifests itself in memory problems from the age of 35 to 40. If successful, it could also potentially be used to treat people with the most common form of Alzheimer’s, which occurs after age 65, at the earliest signs of the disease.”

According to the researchers, the challenge now is to find a way to edit the genome of millions of brain cells. “We are looking at different possibilities, including the use of non-infectious viruses, to deliver the editing complex inside neurons. Now that the proof-of-concept has been established in human cells in vitro, we will test this approach in mice that express Alzheimer’s disease. If the findings are conclusive, we hope to be able to conduct a small-scale study in people with mutations that cause the onset of Alzheimer’s at age 35 to 40,” said Tremblay.","Research provides potential new way of preventing Alzheimer’s disease7 SHARESPosted: 15 February 2022 | Ria Kakkad (Drug Target Review) |New pre-clinical research from the Université Laval Faculty of Medicine and CHU de Québec–Université Laval Research Centre showed genetically mutating human cells could avoid Alzheimer’s disease.

This framework allowed us to compare studies measuring and reporting PA in a wide variety of ways on the same activity exposure scale of marginal MET-hours per week (mMET-hours/week). This meant we could be more inclusive of the available evidence than previous meta-analyses and we could explore the dose–response relationships between non-occupational PA and nine site-specific cancers for the first time. To contextualise our results for public health promotion, we generated potential population impact fractions (PIFs) to estimate the proportion of preventable deaths and disease outcomes at different non-occupational PA levels.

Accurate estimation of the dose–response association between PA and disease outcomes, combined with prevalence estimates, is a prerequisite to assessing the population disease burden of insufficient PA and the potential impact of changes to population levels of PA. Modelling studies that evaluate public health strategies aimed at increasing population activity levels have found that the shape of the dose–response association makes a significant difference when quantifying population health impacts. 6

Higher levels of physical activity (PA) are associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality, CVD and some site-specific cancers. 2–8 The highest quality evidence for these associations and the population impact of low PA levels comes from disease-specific meta-analyses. However, differing methods used in previous meta-analyses limit comparability of relative risks across different outcomes. The only initiative to consistently consider the population impact across diseases (five in total) is the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study, which uses estimates of total PA, including occupational activity. 9 This is problematic as occupational activity is generally poorly measured compared with non-occupational activity and estimates of activity at work often dwarf the non-occupational component. One reason for this is the use of gross metabolic equivalent of task (MET)-hour/week to quantify PA volume. Sedentary office work may be considered to cost approximately 1.25 METs, of which 1 MET represents resting metabolic rate. Non-occupational activity is typically more intense (eg, walking at 4.0 km/hour is approximately 3 METs), meaning the relative contribution of the resting metabolic rate is smaller. Including low-intensity high-duration activities such as occupational activity without marginalising the resting component can therefore distort the PA exposure dramatically. Furthermore, even when occupational PA is well measured, it remains unclear whether it has similar health benefits to non-occupational activity. 10 These factors add statistical noise, decreasing the accuracy of the estimated associations, and may underestimate the contribution of non-occupational PA.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death globally, responsible for 17.9 million annual deaths in 2019, 1 whereas cancers were responsible for 9.6 million deaths in 2017. 1 Both conditions top the global disease burden with respect to disability-adjusted life-years. 2 The relative contribution of various risk and protective factors to the incidence of, and mortality from, these conditions is an ongoing debate.

We explored the impact of six potential sources of bias in individual articles and our meta-analytical procedures: how studies had analysed participants with other morbidities, whether they excluded early incident cases during follow-up, duration of follow-up, imputation procedures for missing data, aspects of our approach to exposure harmonisation and separation of occupational PA. For each of these, we contrasted the overall risk estimates between groups of studies with different characteristics. This was done for the five outcomes with the largest number of separate results (all-cause mortality, and total CVD and cancer mortality and incidence), using a fixed PA level of 8.75 mMET-hours/week, relevant to the six sources of bias.

PIFs were calculated for all outcomes based on PA exposure levels in the population of all included cohorts for a given outcome (see formula in online supplemental eMethods 6 ). 20 PIFs were calculated for three exposure levels based on the equivalents of the WHO moderate-to-vigorous aerobic PA recommendations for adults 21 : 8.75 mMET-hours/week (the minimum recommended level, equivalent to 2.5 hours/week of PA at an intensity of 3.5 mMET, such as brisk walking), 17.5 mMET-hours/week (upper bound of recommended levels for health benefits) and 4.375 mMET-hours/week (half the minimum recommended level). The risk estimates used to calculate PIFs were taken from the dose–response curves, which pooled the most adjusted associations provided by the individual studies.

To investigate the potential effect of study-level confounders on the pooled results across outcomes, we conducted subgroup analyses with the 11 studies that reported results for all all-cause, CVD and cancer mortality outcomes and contrasted them with results from the corresponding main analysis. We also conducted subgroup analysis by sex using studies that reported separate results for men and women.

We performed a two-stage random-effects meta-analysis. In the first stage, we estimated study-specific dose–response coefficients using generalised least squares to incorporate the correlation within each set of log-relative risks. 16 17 In the second stage, we estimated the pooled coefficients by combining study-specific dose–response coefficients using restricted maximum likelihood, 18 19 with cohorts weighted by the inverse of their variance. We assumed non-linearity of dose–response associations, 2–4 7 9 13 and thus modelled them by fitting restricted cubic splines. Given that the volumes of PA reported in most studies were at the lower end of the exposure range and that there is greater uncertainty about the reliability of very high levels of self-reported PA, we set three knots at the 0th, 37.5th and 75th percentiles of person-years rather than persons (0th, 42.5th and 85th percentiles in sensitivity analyses). The slope was fixed at the last knot. If the statistical model was unable to converge, we progressively increased the percentile for the upper knot by 1% until model convergence. Dose–response curves were drawn from 1000 points evenly distributed between 0 mMET-hour/week and the largest PA dose observed in the cohorts included for the outcome of interest.

We conducted a meta-analysis for any outcome with results from at least four cohorts. Where necessary, risk estimates were recalculated to set the least active category as the referent. 15 For studies reporting only stratified results (eg, sex or ethnicity), we combined stratum-specific risks into overall population estimates using fixed-effect meta-analysis.

Some articles provided aggregated exposures of non-occupational and occupational PA alongside other behaviours, such as sleep or sedentary time. When quantified information about these behaviours was available, this was subtracted from the point estimate of each exposure category. If no quantifiable data were available, we assumed occupational activity to be 40 hours/week at 1.25 MET (or 0.25 mMET) or the value of the lowest exposure category and subtracted this from all exposure categories.

To marginalise studies reporting volume of PA in gross units, 1 MET-hour was subtracted for each hour of activity. If the mean duration was not available, we used a conversion equation derived from all remaining studies where both volume and duration were available ( online supplemental eMethods 5 ).

PA exposures described in studies as frequency and duration measures were converted to weekly duration. If session duration was not provided, we assumed a duration of 0.75 hours/session (0.5 hours/session in sensitivity analyses). Categorical frequency data (eg, never, sometimes and often) were converted to weekly duration using assumptions for both frequency (eg, 0, 2 and 5 sessions per week) and duration of sessions. When PA intensity was not explicitly described, we considered the reported activities as light, moderate or vigorous based on the description provided and using the Compendium of Physical Activities. 14 We assigned mMET values of 1.5 for light, 3.5 for moderate and moderate-to-vigorous, and 7.0 for vigorous PA (1 mMET less in sensitivity analyses).

A comprehensive data harmonisation was conducted to combine PA data from different sources. We harmonised reported PA exposure levels from all included studies into a common metric of non-occupational PA volume in mMET-hours/week, reflecting the rate of energy expenditure outside of work, above the resting metabolic rate (1 MET). This allows correct equating of PA volume of time spent at different PA intensity levels. 13 The principles of each aspect of our harmonisation procedure are described in the following sections and presented in a flow chart available in our OSF repository . The last columns of the table on ‘Details of included articles and original and harmonized exposures’ in the same OSF repository contain the details of how the original PA exposure categories of each study were harmonised to mMET-hours/week values.

For each exposure category, we extracted information to quantify PA volume, number of cases, number of participants and/or person-years of follow-up, and risk estimates with 95% CIs. Risk estimates from the most adjusted model were used. When available, risk estimates of the most adjusted model without adiposity-related covariates (eg, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference) were retrieved and used in sensitivity analyses. Exposure data were extracted to the level of precision reported in the published study before being harmonised to PA volume in mMET-hours/week. Risk estimates were extracted exactly as reported. Results reported separately by sex or other attributes (eg, age, ethnicity) or for multiple cohorts within an article were treated as separate associations. If the original publication did not fully report information required for the meta-analysis, data were obtained from other publications using the same cohort, imputation procedures ( online supplemental eMethods 4 ) or by contacting the authors. We had no control over the methods used to handle confounders and missing data in the original analyses.

We extracted data on publication (first author, year of publication), study characteristics (country, cohort name, sample size, age and sex of participants, and duration of follow-up), PA exposure assessment (instrument, domains of activity and exposure categories) and outcome assessment (defined using the International Classification of Disease 10th revision (ICD-10) codes as reported in the PROSPERO registration and online supplemental eMethods 1 ). We extracted whether fatal, non-fatal or the combination of fatal and non-fatal events was tallied. We also identified how original study analyses had considered baseline morbidity (exclusion at baseline or statistical adjustment in multivariable regression models) and early incident cases during follow-up.

Only articles that examined leisure-time PA, alone or in combination with other domains or specific types of activity, were included. We excluded articles whose measures of PA contained occupational activity that could not be factored out and that investigated individual domains of PA that did not include leisure-time activity (eg, transport-related PA only).

Online supplemental eMethods 1 shows the study inclusion and exclusion criteria. We included prospective cohort studies that followed adults (≥18 years) without pre-existing conditions, reported PA at baseline in at least three ordinal exposure levels and reported risk estimates for the examined outcomes. We excluded studies with <10 000 participants to limit potential bias from small study sizes with positive results; this is the required cohort sample size for outcomes with up to 70% of subjects in the unexposed group (ie, no or less physically active), expected incidence rate in the unexposed group around 15% or more, and assumed relative risk of 0.85, when type I and type II errors are 0.05 and 0.20, respectively. These are reasonable parameters for the investigated populations, exposure and endpoints. We also excluded studies where the follow-up period was <3 years to minimise reverse causality bias, which is in accordance with the findings of Lee et al. 11

In studies that did not report the duration or intensity of PA, assuming (where appropriate) shorter session duration (0.5 hours instead of 0.75 hours) and lower intensity (1 mMET lower for moderate and vigorous PA) did not materially alter the dose–response associations for most outcomes, especially analyses which included the largest number of separate results ( online supplemental eResults 4 ). When shorter duration and lower intensity were used, associations were stronger for CVD outcomes, particularly at lower PA volumes. Placing the restricted cubic spline knots at the 42.5th and 85th percentiles resulted in less stable estimations at higher PA volumes, with those specific segments of the dose–response curves being based on less data and with a higher risk of exposure misclassification.

Across the five outcomes with the largest number of separate results (all-cause mortality, and total CVD and cancer mortality and incidence), 83%–93% of the studies used statistical adjustments to control for other morbidities at baseline, often combined with exclusion of adults with more serious pre-existing conditions. Studies that predominantly used statistical adjustments tended to report stronger associations for CVD mortality compared with studies that excluded adults with pre-existing conditions at baseline. Between 54% and 59% of the studies did not exclude mortality and disease events occurring within the first few years of follow-up, and those that did tended to report weaker associations for all-cause mortality and CVD mortality and incidence. The median follow-up time was 10 years for each outcome, with no evidence of bias between studies with longer and shorter follow-up time. Data imputation was required for 58%–64% of the studies, but no evidence of bias was found. The most frequently used procedures for exposure harmonisation were measurement unit conversions (42%–49% of studies) and the assumption of standard values for the intensity and duration of PA reported (39%–50%), but no evidence of bias was found. In 75% of the studies, the original exposure assessment did not include occupational PA and no evidence of bias was observed for studies requiring domain separation ( online supplemental eResults 3 ).

Sex-stratified results were available for all-cause, CVD and cancer mortality and incidence of total CVD, coronary heart disease, stroke, total cancer, and cancers of the colon and rectum. There was some evidence of stronger associations in women than in men for all-cause and CVD mortality and CVD incidence, but the reverse for cancer mortality and incidence ( online supplemental eResults 2 ).

Assuming a causal relationship between non-occupational PA and the examined health outcomes, shifting the distribution of non-occupational PA in the cohorts towards the equivalent recommended level of moderate-to-vigorous aerobic activity (8.75 mMET-hours/week) would have averted a substantial fraction of the population disease burden. For example, if all individuals accumulated at least 8.75 mMET-hours/week, then 15.7% (95% CI 13.2 to 18.2), 12.3% (95% CI 9.4 to 15.2) and 7.1% (95% CI 5.1 to 9.0) of all-cause, CVD-related and cancer-related deaths, respectively, potentially would have been averted. Additionally, 10.9% (95% CI 8.4 to 13.3) and 5.2% (95% CI 3.6 to 6.9) of all incident cases of CVD and cancer would have been prevented. Notably, 10.1% (95% CI 8.3 to 11.9) of all deaths would have been prevented if all adults achieved at least half this PA level ( table 1 ).

The association was weaker and more linear for total cancer incidence (12% lower risk (95% CI 8 to 15) at 8.75 mMET-hours/week). For the incidence of site-specific cancers, curvilinear and stronger associations were observed for head and neck, myeloid leukaemia, myeloma, and gastric cardia (from 35% to 22% lower risk at 8.75 mMET-hours/week). Weaker and more linear associations were observed for lung, liver, endometrial, colon and breast (from 16% to 5% lower risk at 8.75 mMET-hours/week). Non-significant associations were observed for bladder, oesophageal, prostate and rectal cancer ( figure 4 , table 1 ). No eligible studies were available for malignant melanoma.

We screened titles and abstracts of 48 525 articles, of which 1280 were selected for full-text screening. A total of 196 articles 2 22–216 were included in the meta-analysis ( online supplemental eFigure 1 ), covering 94 cohorts and reporting 330 separate results. The evidence base was largest for all-cause mortality (50 results; 163 415 543 person-years, 811 616 events), total CVD incidence (37 results; 28 884 209 person-years, 74 757 events) and total cancer incidence (31 results; 35 500 867 person-years, 185 870 events). Details of all selected and excluded articles can be found in our OSF repository , and data underlying each of the dose–response estimations can be downloaded at https://shiny.mrc-epid.cam.ac.uk/meta-analyses-physical-activity / .

Discussion

We present comprehensive dose–response meta-analyses of the associations between non-occupational PA and a wide range of mortality and disease outcomes. Our extensive exposure data harmonisation allowed inclusion of a larger evidence base than previous meta-analyses for 17 of 22 health outcomes investigated. For instance, our meta-analysis for all-cause mortality includes over 160 million person-years and 810 000 deaths. These are 17 and 7 times larger, respectively, than what were included in the previously largest dose–response analysis to date (9.39 million person-years and 117 000 deaths).2 Our inclusive approach has a number of advantages. First, we were able to estimate dose–response associations for nine site-specific cancers for the first time. Second, inclusion of more data increases confidence in the results beyond previous estimates. Third, it allowed us to include data from a larger number of countries. Fourth, having used consistent methods for several health outcomes allows the best possible comparison of the shape of the dose–response functions across these outcomes. For example, having one set of dose–response results consistently estimated across several outcomes is particularly useful for health impact modelling, for example, to quantify the probable impacts of changes to population-level PA.

We showed inverse non-linear dose–response associations for all-cause mortality and a range of CVD and cancer outcomes. This suggests that the greatest potential benefits can be achieved through small increases in non-occupational PA for those with an inactive lifestyle, with incrementally smaller additional benefits up to approximately 17.5 mMET-hours/week. Above this level, the evidence base was weaker. Shifting population levels of activity towards achieving the equivalent to 150 min/week of moderate-to-vigorous aerobic PA (8.75 mMET-hours/week) potentially would have prevented 16% of all premature deaths recorded.

Compared with previous studies, we found similar associations for all-cause2 3 and cancer mortality,4 and stronger associations and narrower CIs for CVD mortality,5 6 at the equivalent recommended levels of moderate-to-vigorous aerobic PA. For cancers of the bladder, breast, colon, endometrium, oesophagus, liver and rectum, our results were largely similar to that of a recent pooled analysis.7 However, we found stronger associations for cancers of the gastric cardia, head and neck, myeloid leukaemia, and myeloma, whereas the association for kidney cancer was non-significant. Contrasting with Moore et al’s8 finding of harmful effects of PA on prostate cancer, our results did not show an association. Comparisons should be interpreted with caution as most previous studies have focused solely on leisure-time PA2 3 6–8 and meta-analyses by Li et al 4 and Wahid et al 5 included studies that assessed PA in any domain.

Compared with the results from the GBD,9 which has assessed total PA rather than non-occupational PA, we found stronger associations for heart disease and stroke at the equivalent minimum recommended moderate-to-vigorous aerobic PA level. Associations reported by the GBD at approximately 130 MET-hours/week for total PA were observed in our study at 17.5 mMET-hours/week for non-occupational PA, a much lower volume even considering that we excluded energy expenditure from the resting metabolic rate and occupational activity. Given the challenges of assessing occupational activity, estimates of total PA from self-report are often implausibly high.217 Hence, the importance of PA may have been underestimated by the GBD. This, combined with uncertainties around the health benefits of occupational PA,10 218 means our results may be more relevant from a public health perspective.

It is surprising that the risk difference for all-cause mortality (31% at the equivalent minimum recommended moderate-to-vigorous aerobic PA level) is similar to that for total CVD (29%) and much larger than for total cancer mortality (15%). Equally, it is surprising that the association for total CVD incidence is stronger than that for coronary heart disease or stroke. Weaker associations would be expected for more composite outcomes (eg, all-cause mortality and total CVD incidence) than for the outcomes within them for which a significant association has been established. Potential explanations include detection bias for some disease events, misclassification of causes of death (especially for more specific disease outcomes), differential residual confounding, reverse causality by outcome, and different inclusion criteria by disease outcome, such as the inclusion of different disease groups which may have stronger associations with PA.219 There may also be study-level confounders, and this is supported by our post-hoc subgroup analysis, which showed that studies reporting all three mortality outcomes found stronger associations for CVD than for all-cause mortality. Taken together, it is probable that the risk estimates for all-cause mortality are more accurate than for specific disease outcomes.

Our risk of bias and sensitivity analyses showed that the methodological assumptions and decisions made for the pooled analyses did not significantly impact the dose–response associations observed. However, some methodological differences between the original studies seem to alter the magnitude of the pooled associations. Studies that did not exclude people with pre-existing conditions at baseline or mortality or disease events occurring within the first years of follow-up tended to observe stronger associations, as did studies with shorter follow-up, which may in part be indicative of reverse causality.11 220 For some outcomes, stronger associations were also observed in studies that did not include adjustment for adiposity in their analytical models, which can be interpreted as either being prone to residual confounding or a more inclusive estimation of the total causal effect, if adiposity is considered a mediator between PA and the investigated health outcomes.

A strength of our study was the use of comprehensive exposure data harmonisation methods that enabled the inclusion of a larger evidence base. This also allowed us to study health associations over a wider range of the PA exposure and increased the density of data in the area of the dose–response curves with high non-linearity. Another strength is the use of more sophisticated meta-analytical methods that allow the shape of the dose–response association to vary across the exposure range, rather than linear models of transformed exposure or grouping doses within high versus low PA or multiple exposure intervals. We improved the placement of spline knots compared with our previous work13 by considering the distribution of person-years instead of non-weighted associations across the PA range, acknowledging the paucity of data at higher volumes of PA.

Our study also has limitations. There are levels of the PA exposure for which health associations are not reported in many of the original studies and hence there is still substantial uncertainty at those levels in the meta-analyses for some outcomes. Many of the included studies relied on self-reported questionnaires without validation or calibration data that could be used in the exposure harmonisation. In the exposure data harmonisation procedures, it was also sometimes necessary to make assumptions about parameters of PA, such as intensity and duration, where these were not explicitly reported. Nonetheless, our sensitivity analyses demonstrated the robustness of our results to the assumptions made. Measurement error is likely to lead to an underestimation of the true association between PA and the various outcomes, as demonstrated by the stronger associations observed in studies using device-based measures of PA.221 Regression dilution bias, particularly in studies with longer follow-up times, might also have affected the associations observed,220 which can be mitigated by repeated PA measures over time. Misclassification of some outcomes will have occurred in original studies as ascertainment of outcomes may not be similarly accurate across all outcomes and studies. Residual confounding and reverse causation could remain. To mitigate confounding, the most comprehensively adjusted risk estimates were used in this meta-analysis. However, the level of covariate adjustment and the degree to which these covariates effectively control for confounding were not consistent across all studies. We excluded studies with less than 3 years of follow-up to mitigate reverse causation.220 Although the bias from reverse causation diminishes with longer periods of follow-up, changes in PA level over time could be possible.11 222 Our estimates of population impact are based on the assumptions that the dose–response relationships are causal and that the prevalence of PA in our cohorts is representative of the wider population. The time lag between searches and publication of our results is longer than typical due to the scale of this review. We did not use validated tools to assess risk of bias or certainty of evidence. Nonetheless, we assessed six critical potential sources of bias for observational studies in PA and health outcomes and quantified their impacts on our results. Aspects included in other tools but not quantified by us, such as methods to measure exposure and outcome and attempt to control for established confounding factors (eg, sex and age), were not materially different across the included studies and hence it was not possible to assess their impact. Our analyses also cover aspects that are important for judging the confidence in the evidence base, such as the dose–response gradient, precision of the effect estimates, risk of bias assessment and subgroup analysis to investigate the effect of study-level confounders.

Our findings support the current PA recommendations of 150–300 min/week of moderate aerobic PA (or 75–150 min/week of vigorous aerobic PA, or an equivalent combination of moderate and vigorous activities),21 in that this exposure level generally seems to equate to maximum or near-to-maximal benefits. However, the dose–response associations also demonstrate that appreciable health benefits can be gained from 75 min/week or less of moderate activity (ie, half the recommended minimum level). Thus, our findings support the recent change in public health messaging to ‘doing some PA is better than doing none’, and suggest that the emphasis on threshold-based recommendations could be further reduced.

It should be noted that our exposure estimates are derived from a variety of self-reported questionnaires that capture mostly moderate and vigorous activities. These exposure estimates differ from those derived using device-based measures, which also record light-intensity and intermittent activities that are more difficult to recall.221 223 224 Self-report and device-based measures are therefore complementary but not interchangeable,224 an important consideration when formulating public health messages.

Future research should investigate the reasons for the apparent inconsistencies in dose–response associations between composite and individual disease endpoints. Although our risk of bias and sensitivity analyses showed robustness to the approaches we took during data handling and dose harmonisation, future studies could quantify methodological uncertainties (eg, inaccuracies in exposure assessment) and propagate them in the aetiological analyses to provide more realistic uncertainty ranges for the dose–response associations. The evidence base was weaker for very high volumes of activity and further research is required to ascertain the shape of associations more reliably at the higher end of the PA continuum.","6Higher levels of physical activity (PA) are associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality, CVD and some site-specific cancers.
Including low-intensity high-duration activities such as occupational activity without marginalising the resting component can therefore distort the PA exposure dramatically.
We assumed non-linearity of dose–response associations, 2–4 7 9 13 and thus modelled them by fitting restricted cubic splines.
First, we were able to estimate dose–response associations for nine site-specific cancers for the first time.

But sometimes we may crave a juicy burger with all the fixings or the sugar rush from a delicious dessert. We all have our favorite comfort foods.

I tease my sister Bev, who is 84 and has stage 3 Parkinson’s disease (PD), that she is a “sweetnik.” You can always find an assortment of baked goods on her kitchen counter, from apple turnovers to cookies and pie.

Being Italian and the current matriarch of our family, she says, “Well, I always want to have something on hand in case someone stops over for coffee.”

“Sure, you do,” I reply knowingly.

In addition to having a sweet tooth, Bev enjoys many comfort foods, such as mashed potatoes, applesauce, and hot dogs.

As the Borough of Manhattan Community College noted, people may crave comfort foods because they make us feel more in control and relaxed, and can bring back nostalgic memories. Eating foods that are high in carbohydrates or sugar can increase serotonin levels, which helps to reduce stress.

In a 2014 article published in the Journal of Consumer Psychology, researchers explored the link between food and mood. They found that being in a positive mood causes a person to focus more on long-term goals such as health, which often results in healthier food choices. Negative moods, on the other hand, drive people to focus on more immediate goals like mood management, and to choose more indulgent foods.

Comfort foods may be especially important for the well-being of people with PD or other chronic diseases, as depression and anxiety are common in these populations. Enjoying an occasional treat may also help Parkinson’s patients to reduce stress levels and better cope with the effects of the disease.

Bev’s choice of soft comfort foods like applesauce is also related to her chewing and swallowing difficulties. Bev has dentures, but she also experiences dry mouth and decreased strength in her jaw, tongue, and facial muscles due to PD.

Although there is no specific diet for Parkinson’s, eating and avoiding certain foods may help alleviate some symptoms and medication side effects. For example, consuming more fiber and clear liquids can ease constipation, a common issue for people with PD. If you have low blood pressure, occasionally splurging on salty snacks may be helpful.

Parkinson’s News Today provides additional suggestions for optimizing your diet, but it’s always important to consult your medical team about which foods are best for you.

Buon appetito!

...the most effective way to prevent infections and save lives is breaking the chains of transmission. And to do that, you must test and isolate. You cannot fight a fire blindfolded. And we cannot stop this pandemic if we don't know who is infected. We have a simple message for all countries: test, test, test.

The pandemic exposed critical shortcomings of existing diagnostic techniques. It revealed an urgent need for tests that are faster, simpler, cheaper and more scalable than existing methods, and just as accurate.

Three years on, the global face of diagnostics has changed. New techniques of disease diagnosis have been developed that can be applied to other emerging zoonotic pathogens such as disease X a hypothetical infectious disease that has the potential to develop into a pandemic.

As a molecular scientist with a keen interest in veterinary disease diagnostics, I have closely followed developments in the diagnostic space since the start of the pandemic. These emerging technologies, together with conventional tests, have the potential to overcome bottlenecks in the current diagnostic procedures.

By incorporating these tests into a country's healthcare system, clinicians and policy makers are better equipped to practise precision medicine and to react to potential outbreaks.

The first diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes Covid disease) used established molecular techniques such as reverse transcription polymerase reaction (RT-PCR). These techniques detect and identify organisms by amplifying their genetic material millions of times.

Running the tests however requires trained technicians and expensive equipment.

As the pandemic became more severe, other ways to test for the virus had to be developed. Substances and compounds needed to effectively run diagnostic tests were in short supply and many countries did not have the kinds of sophisticated laboratories needed for the existing tests. Low- and middle-income countries like those throughout the African continent had limited finances too and not enough trained specialists to handle the demand.

Isothermal amplification techniques helped to address the need. This is a simple process which rapidly and effectively amplifies DNA and RNA (genetic material) at constant temperature.

Immunological assays also helped. These tests can be used on-site or in the lab and are able to detect specific molecules such as antibodies and antigens. Antibodies are generated in a person's body when a foreign molecule (antigen) invades the body.

These cost-effective tests provide rapid results and can be used on a big scale even where resources are scarce.

The major challenge of these tests is that they are less accurate. Unlike molecular tests, which amplify the genetic material of the virus, immunological assays do not amplify their protein signal.

This makes them less sensitive. The risk is high that an infected person might incorrectly be told that they don't have the virus.

The global diagnostic community realised it was time to look at methods that were as accurate as conventional molecular tests but could be used outside laboratories and on a large scale.

Scientists needed a new generation of rapid, accurate, accessible and affordable diagnostic tests.

The National Institutes of Health in the US set up the Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics programme (RADx) in 2020 to fund innovative point-of-care and home-based tests and to speed up the development, validation and commercialisation of these tests.

One particularly interesting change in this space is the use of CRISPR. The technology was previously known for its use in gene editing.

But now it has revolutionised diagnostics with the launch of SHERLOCK and DETECTR, two innovative CRISPR-based kits used for the detection of SARS-CoV-2.

These are particularly sensitive and specific and provide a visual colour readout using a commercially available paper dipstick, making them suitable for use as a point-of-care test.

The versatility of these techniques enables researches to apply the same principles to the detection of other infectious diseases too.

There have also been advances in using biosensors, nanotechnology, smartphone-based tests and wearable technologies for diagnostics.

Overall, in the past three years, the focus of disease testing has moved from simple detecting and understanding to incorporating speed, efficiency and portability of the tests.

While there is a lot to celebrate in the diagnostic space, problems remain. There are barriers in developing and disseminating tests, particularly in poorer countries. Fairer access to quality testing and improved data sharing between countries is needed to eliminate the inequity in diagnostics.

The lack of resources to deliver a robust regulatory system in low- and middle-income countries also poses a serious challenge.

Companies have less incentive to develop and commercialise products where there is weak regulation. Thus countries still depend on tests that are manufactured elsewhere.

As the world moves out of its pandemic response phase, it is likely that investment in diagnostics will fall. With a reduced need for tests, the economic return of investing in developing tests will diminish.

This is unfortunate as there are still so many healthcare challenges worldwide and unless disease surveillance is proactive, it won't be possible to predict where the next pandemic might emerge from.

The momentum created by the Covid pandemic offers an opportunity and should be used to build on the things that worked well in the diagnostic industry and to improve on the things that didn't.

Parkinson’s disease is the second most common form of neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer’s disease. In an aging population, the number of people diagnosed with PD is set to rise.

Existing treatments aim to alleviate symptoms but do not prevent progression.

A recent study has shown that tiny antibodies — called nanobodies — produced by llamas could hold potential for the development of future treatments.

Parkinson’s disease (PD) starts when nerve cells in the part of the brain that controls movement stop working properly or die.

These cells stop producing the chemical dopamine, which is crucial for regulating the cell signaling responsible for movement. This produces the symptoms of PD. Exactly why these cells die is still unknown.

Dr. Beckie Port, head of research communications and engagement at Parkinson’s UK, told Medical News Today, “With more than 40 symptoms, Parkinson’s can have a significant impact on daily life, and those living with the condition need better treatments urgently.”

Diagnosis of the disease is not straightforward. There is no specific laboratory test, and diagnosis is usually based on medical history and examination. Often people dismiss the early signs of PD as part of aging.

Scientists think that Parkinson’s disease may happen due to a combination of environmental and genetic factors. Although there is no one specific gene that can be said to cause PD, there are several genes that appear to play a part.

One of these genes is called LRRK2. This codes for a protein called leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2). Mutations in the gene are involved in the inherited form of PD. Overactivation of the gene also plays a role in other forms of PD and Crohn’s disease.

Current drug development research has focused on LRRK2 kinase inhibitors that interfere with the binding of the substrates of the protein, but there are concerns about potential side effects. New research has found a way to inhibit the LRRK2 protein using a different mechanism, with potentially fewer side effects.

A recent study was led by Prof. Wim Versées, Ph.D. at the Vrije University of Brussels and theFlanders Institute for Biotechnology in Belgium.

The scientists found that nanobodies — small, antibody-like molecules — can target LRRK2. Not only can the nanobodies block the action of the protein, but some of them can also selectively inhibit certain activities of the protein while leaving others to continue. Their findings appear in the journal PNAS.

Dr. James Beck, Ph.D., chief scientific officer of the Parkinson’s Foundation, told Medical News Today: “This is a very creative set of experiments that utilize a unique approach to differentially modulating the activity of the LRRK2 protein.”

“Before,” he continued, “scientists could only turn the LRRK2 protein on or off. However, these results allow for the precise modulation of LRRK2 activity. This is like moving from a stereo that only had an on-off switch to one that now has a full suite of controls to fine-tune the sound.”","Share on Pinterest A recent study investigates whether llama nanobodies might help design future Parkinson’s treatments.

209,209,https://reliefweb.int/report/malawi/disease-outbreak-news-wild-poliovirus-type-1-wpv1-malawi-3-march-2022,Disease outbreak news: Wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) - Malawi (3 March 2022) - Malawi,"On 17 February 2022, WHO received an update regarding the detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) in Malawi which was previously notified on 31 January 2022 through an IHR notification as a case of poliovirus type 2 (PV2). The case, a child under 5 years old, from Central constituency, Lilongwe district, Central Region, developed acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) on 19 November 2021. Two stool specimens were collected for testing on 26 and 27 November, and were received at the Regional Reference Laboratory, the National Institute of Communicable Disease (NICD) in South Africa, on 14 January 2022, and then forwarded to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC).

Sequencing of the virus conducted by the NICD on 2 February, and the US CDC on 12 February confirmed this case as WPV1. Analysis shows that the current WPV1 isolate in Malawi is genetically linked to a Pakistan sequence detected in 2020 in Sindh province.

Africa was declared free of indigenous wild polio in August 2020 after eliminating all forms of wild polio from the region, and in Malawi, the last clinically confirmed WPV case was reported in 1992.

Public health response

Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) partners, including WHO, is supporting the Malawi health authorities to carry out a risk assessment and outbreak response, including supplemental immunization. Surveillance measures are being activated and expanded in Malawi and neighbouring countries to detect potential cases.

GPEI Rapid Response Team has been sent to Malawi to support coordination, surveillance, data management, communications, and operations. Partner organizations also sent teams to support emergency operations and innovative vaccination campaign solutions.

WHO risk assessment

Polio is a highly infectious disease, caused by a virus that invades the nervous system and can cause permanent paralysis (approximately one in 200 infections) or death (approximately 2-10% of paralyzed cases). The virus is transmitted by person-to-person, mainly through the faecal-oral route or, less frequently, by a common vehicle (for example, contaminated water or food).

Two of the three types of wild poliovirus have been eradicated (WPV2 and WPV3), with ongoing global efforts to eradicate WPV1. Currently, wild poliovirus is endemic in two countries: Pakistan and Afghanistan. The detection of WPV1 outside the two countries where the disease is endemic demonstrates the continuous risk of international spread of the disease until every corner of the world is free of WPV1.

The risk at the national level in Malawi is assessed as high given the presence of high population density, low vaccination coverage (<80%) in many districts and lack of a catch-up campaign for more than six years, accumulated susceptible populations, suboptimal AFP surveillance, and lack of environmental surveillance, that may be affecting the ability to ascertain cases. Furthermore, the switch from the trivalent Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) to bivalent OPV in Malawi was completed on 25 April 2016, and Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) was introduced on 14 December 2018. The most recent supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) with a vaccine containing type 2 vaccine were conducted in 2013.

Additionally, the country is currently affected by tropical storm Ana which may impact the country’s response capacity by impairing Polio SIAs and surveillance activities. According to the UN flash update on Malawi tropical storm Ana, as of 11 February, there have been 995 072 people affected in 19 districts, 206 people injured, 46 people reported dead, and 18 people are reported still missing. The United Nations and partners are supporting the life-saving emergency flood response

The risk at the regional level is assessed as moderate given the significant population movement between Mozambique and Malawi, suboptimal vaccination coverage in the neighbouring countries, and suboptimal AFP surveillance activities.

The risk at the global level is assessed as low given the existing response capacity in place and the moderately high global Polio coverage estimates.

WHO advice

It is important that all countries, particularly those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen the surveillance of AFP cases to rapidly detect any new poliovirus importations and to facilitate a rapid response.

Under the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR), countries must investigate and notify any poliovirus isolate, whether the isolate is from AFP cases, AFP contacts or environmental surveillance. Local health authorities should initiate the investigation within 24 hours of a poliovirus isolate being reported.

Isolation of poliovirus in a previously non-infected area represents an event or outbreak that requires national authorities to complete an immediate risk assessment to inform the type and scale of response. Following initial investigation and risk assessment, national authorities must continue to collect detailed information to update the situation analysis and risk assessment (i.e. results from laboratory investigations, or detailed information on affected communities, etc.). Neighbouring countries/regions must also continue to update their risk assessment with support from WHO regional offices.

Countries, territories, and areas should also maintain systematically high routine immunization coverage rates (>90%) both at national and subnational levels to minimize the consequences of any new poliovirus introduction. WHO recommends that two high-quality large-scale vaccination campaigns (>90% of children vaccinated) should be completed within eight weeks of laboratory sequencing results. A mop-up round might be required as an additional step wherever monitoring suggests children have been missed in certain health districts or areas, to ensure interruption of transmission (even in the absence of new poliovirus detections). Communication and social mobilization activities should be an integrated part of reactive Polio immunization campaigns.

WHO does not recommend any restriction on travel and/or trade to Malawi based on the information available for this current event. WHO’s International Travel and Health recommends that all travelers to polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Residents (and visitors for more than 4 weeks) from infected areas should receive an additional dose of OPV or IPV within four weeks to 12 months of travel.

As per the advice of an Emergency Committee convened under the International Health Regulations (2005), efforts to limit the international spread of poliovirus remain a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Countries affected by poliovirus transmission are subject to Temporary Recommendations. To comply with the Temporary Recommendations issued under the PHEIC, any country infected by poliovirus should declare the outbreak as a national public health emergency, consider vaccination of all international travelers, ensure such travelers are provided with an international certificate of vaccination, restrict at the point of departure the international travel of any resident lacking documentation of appropriate polio vaccination, intensify cross-border efforts to substantially increase vaccination coverage of travelers, and intensify efforts to increase routine immunization coverage.","On 17 February 2022, WHO received an update regarding the detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) in Malawi which was previously notified on 31 January 2022 through an IHR notification as a case of poliovirus type 2 (PV2).
Analysis shows that the current WPV1 isolate in Malawi is genetically linked to a Pakistan sequence detected in 2020 in Sindh province.
Public health responseGlobal Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) partners, including WHO, is supporting the Malawi health authorities to carry out a risk assessment and outbreak response, including supplemental immunization.
Two of the three types of wild poliovirus have been eradicated (WPV2 and WPV3), with ongoing global efforts to eradicate WPV1.

210,210,https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/01/1110022,2021 joins top 7 warmest years on record: WMO,"Although average global temperatures were temporarily cooled by the 2020-2022 La Niña events, 2021 was still one of the seven warmest years on record, according to six leading international datasets consolidated by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).

Global warming and other long-term climate change trends are expected to continue as a result of record levels of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the agency said.

The average global temperature in 2021 was about 1.11 (± 0.13) °C above the pre-industrial era levels. The Paris Agreement calls for all countries to strive towards a limit of 1.5°C of global warming through concerted climate action and realistic Nationally Determined Contributions – the individual country plans that need to become a reality to slow down the rate of heating.

WMO said that it uses six international datasets “to ensure the most comprehensive, authoritative temperature assessment”, and the same data are used in its authoritative annual State of the Climate reports.

Since the 1980s, each decade has been warmer than the previous one, said WMO and “this is expected to continue.”

The warmest seven years have all been since 2015; the top three being 2016, 2019 and 2020. An exceptionally strong El Niño event occurred in 2016, which contributed to record global average warming.

“Back-to-back La Niña events mean that 2021 warming was relatively less pronounced compared to recent years. Even so, 2021 was still warmer than previous years influenced by La Niña”, said WMO Secretary-General, Prof. Petteri Taalas.

Undeniable trend

“The overall long-term warming as a result of greenhouse gas increases, is now far larger than the year-to-year variability in global average temperatures caused by naturally occurring climate drivers”.

“The year 2021 will be remembered for a record-shattering temperature of nearly 50°C in Canada, comparable to the values reported in the hot Saharan Desert of Algeria, exceptional rainfall, and deadly flooding in Asia and Europe as well as drought in parts of Africa and South America”, the WMO chief added.

“Climate change impacts and weather-related hazards had life-changing and devastating impacts on communities on every single continent”, Mr. Taalas underscored.

Others key indicators of global heating include greenhouse gas concentrations, ocean heat content, ocean pH levels (levels of acidity), global mean sea level, glacial mass and the extent of sea ice.

WMO uses datasets – which are based on monthly climatological data from observing sites and ships and buoys in global marine networks - developed and maintained by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (NASA GISS), the United Kingdom’s Met Office Hadley Centre, and the University of East Anglia’s Climatic Research Unit (HadCRUT); and the Berkeley Earth group.

WMO also uses reanalysis datasets from the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts and its Copernicus Climate Change Service, and the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA).

WMO said that the temperature figures will be incorporated into its final report on the State of the Climate in 2021, which will be issued in April this year.

This will reference all key climate indicators and selected climate impacts, and updates a provisional report issued in October 2021 ahead of the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland.","Although average global temperatures were temporarily cooled by the 2020-2022 La Niña events, 2021 was still one of the seven warmest years on record, according to six leading international datasets consolidated by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).

Abnormal stools (poop) tend to be common, especially when Crohn’s disease is active. Digestive symptoms can include diarrhea, constipation, pain, and blood or mucus in the stools.

This article will discuss Crohn's disease, what your stool and bowel movements may be like with the condition, when to see your healthcare provider, and what treatments may be recommended.

What Is Crohn’s Disease?

Crohn’s disease is primarily considered a digestive condition. It causes inflammation in any part of the small or large intestine of the digestive system but can also affect other parts of the body, such as the skin, eyes, and joints. It is one form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), along with ulcerative colitis and indeterminate colitis.

Inflammation and symptoms of the disease can come and go throughout a person’s lifetime. There are currently no cures for Crohn’s disease, but there are effective treatments.



Symptoms of Crohn’s Poop

What is considered normal for stool runs on a spectrum. Most people pass stool (defecate) somewhere between a few times a day to once every few days. What might be outside the normal range is having a bowel movement several times a day or less than once every three days.



Crohn’s disease can cause changes in the stool. The inflammation (swelling and redness) and ulcers caused by Crohn’s disease in the small and/or large intestine can lead to stool frequency, consistency, and appearance outside the normal range.



Crohn’s disease could cause:



What Does Your Poop Look Like With Crohn’s?

Crohn’s disease can cause stool to look different. It could be looser, more difficult to pass, and it could be in various shapes or colors.



Color

Crohn's disease doesn't cause stool to appear in any specific color. However, stool in people with Crohn's disease may be various colors based on how the disease affects them.



People with Crohn's disease may have malabsorption, which means that food isn't completely digested and the nutrients aren't absorbed. If food has a strong color (think green for spinach or black for Oreo cookies) and isn't digested well, it can cause the stool to turn that color.



Crohn's disease may also cause some people to pass blood or mucus in their stools if their disease is active. Blood can appear anywhere from bright red to nearly black. The brighter the color, the further down in the intestines the blood is coming from. Mucus is white or yellowish, looks stringy or like gel, and may be slippery.



In Children

Diarrhea or changes in stool alone aren't enough to diagnose Crohn’s disease in kids. Diarrhea from infections or changes in diet is common in little kids, so other reasons for stool changes will be ruled out first.



However, Crohn’s disease is increasingly being diagnosed in children. Diarrhea is a common symptom of Crohn’s disease in kids, along with abdominal pain. Crohn’s disease in kids also might cause weight loss, growth problems, lack of appetite, joint pains, and skin problems.



Do You Poop a Lot With Crohn’s?

Some people who have Crohn’s disease will go to the bathroom more often than people who don’t live with a digestive disease. In severe Crohn’s disease, diarrhea could occur many times a day.



For some people with Crohn’s disease, stools are infrequent. This can sometimes be caused by a narrowing of the intestines, making stool more difficult to pass.



The key is to know what is typical for inactive Crohn’s disease (called remission) and then know what happens to your stool during a Crohn’s disease flare-up. This varies from person to person. People with Crohn’s disease may find that they’re having more stools, possibly with diarrhea, when their disease is more active.



How to Treat Crohn’s Poop

The symptoms of Crohn’s disease may come and go. One of the ways people treat active disease is with medications. This includes oral drugs (pills), enemas (foams or suppositories), injections, and infusions (medications given through a line in a vein). Dietary changes, vitamins, and supplements are also sometimes tried.



Antidiarrheal medications might sometimes be used for Crohn’s disease but only after talking to a healthcare provider about them. They might not be helpful for some people.



The medications for Crohn’s disease will help treat the inflammation that’s leading to diarrhea, constipation, or other changes with your stool. Most people work with their healthcare providers to find the treatment that helps get symptoms under control.



When to See a Healthcare Provider

People with already diagnosed Crohn’s disease usually see their healthcare provider regularly (every six months or yearly is common). The healthcare provider will usually give instructions on what symptoms should mean seeing them sooner. These could include diarrhea, constipation, blood in the stool, and abdominal pain.



For people who don’t have a diagnosis, seeing a healthcare provider when there are changes to bowel movements is also important.

Diarrhea or constipation that goes on for more than a few days or comes and goes for weeks or months is one reason. Abdominal pain, which either comes on suddenly and is severe or is more nagging and goes on for a long time, is another reason to seek care.



Finally, blood in the stool is never normal. Blood can appear bright red to darker, almost black, making it more difficult to identify as blood. The odor also might be different and smell like pennies. Blood in the stool is always a reason to see a healthcare provider.



Summary

Crohn’s disease can cause changes to stool. This can include changes in color and frequency or the presence of blood or mucus. When stool appears different, it’s important for people already diagnosed with Crohn's disease to talk to a healthcare provider to check if the condition is becoming active again.



A Word From Verywell

Crohn’s disease can cause diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, and blood or mucus in the stool. The symptoms can come on slowly and people tend to normalize them, meaning they become part of life. But these changes are not normal, and they can mean that inflammation is occurring in the intestines.

Seeing a healthcare provider on a regular basis is important to keeping Crohn’s disease symptoms under control.","Abnormal stools (poop) tend to be common, especially when Crohn’s disease is active.

The mosquito species, called Culex lactator, was first detected in Florida in 2018 by researchers affiliated with the University of Florida's Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences (UF/IFAS). The researchers reported their findings in a new study, published Wednesday (March 22) in the Journal of Medical Entomology (opens in new tab).

The UF/IFAS team ran a DNA analysis on the mosquitoes to determine their species. After the researchers initially found C. lactator in Miami-Dade County, other scientists uncovered additional populations in nearby Collier and Lee counties.

The mosquitoes, which physically resemble many others in Florida, may have already seeded populations in additional counties, study lead author Lawrence Reeves (opens in new tab), a mosquito biologist at the UF/IFAS research center in Vero Beach, said in a statement (opens in new tab). It's likely that the pest will continue to spread to more locations in the state.

Related: Should we kill every mosquito on Earth?

""Introductions of new mosquito species like this are concerning because many of our greatest mosquito-related challenges"" — namely, the bug's ability to spread disease — ""are the result of nonnative mosquitoes,"" Reeves said. ""And in a case like this, it's difficult to anticipate what to expect when we know so little about a mosquito species.""

C. lactator belongs to the genus Culex, other members of which are known to transmit dangerous pathogens, such as the West Nile and St. Louis encephalitis viruses. For now, though, scientists don't know whether C. lactator can also spread the diseases.

""It's too early to know whether Culex lactator will exacerbate these challenges, but the implications are often difficult to predict because not all mosquito species are equally capable of transmitting a particular virus or other pathogen,"" Reeves said.

At least 17 nonnative mosquito species have established populations in Florida — 11 within the past 20 years, and six within the last five. Climate change could exacerbate the spread of new mosquitoes to Florida from the tropics, by making the state's environment more hospitable to the pests and increasing the frequency of storms that could carry the invasive species over in the first place, according to the UF/IFAS statement.

Since spotting the C. lactator in Florida, researchers have found specimens carrying the blood of warbler birds, Reeves told The Tampa Bay Times (opens in new tab). ""That's probably something that we don't want to see,"" he said. ""Public health-wise, the viruses that we're most worried about — that this mosquito would serve as a vector for — are really viruses of birds.""","An invasive mosquito species from Central and South America has taken root in South Florida, raising concerns that the pests might spread dangerous viruses, like West Nile.

213,213,https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/genetic-risk-factor-found-covid-19-smell-taste-loss-researchers-say-rcna11996,"Genetic risk factor found for Covid-19 smell and taste loss, researchers say","Scientists are piecing together why some people lose their sense of smell after contracting Covid-19.

A study published Monday in the journal Nature Genetics identified a genetic risk factor associated with the loss of smell after a Covid infection, a discovery that brings experts closer to understanding the perplexing pattern and may point the way toward much-needed treatments.

Six months after contracting Covid, as many as 1.6 million people in the United States are still unable to smell or have experienced a change in their ability to smell. The precise cause of sensory loss related to Covid is not known, but scientists do think it stems from damage to infected cells in a part of the nose called the olfactory epithelium. These cells protect olfactory neurons, which help humans smell.

“How we get from infection to smell loss remains unclear,” said Dr. Justin Turner, an associate professor of otolaryngology at Vanderbilt University who was not a part of the study.

“Early data suggests that supporting cells of the olfactory epithelium are the ones mostly being infected by the virus, and presumably this leads to the death of the neurons themselves,” he said. “But we don’t really, really know why and when that happens, and why it seems to preferentially happen in certain individuals.”

A genetic locus near two olfactory genes is associated with Covid-induced loss of smell and taste, according to the study. A locus is the fixed position of a gene on a chromosome.

This genetic risk factor increases the likelihood a person infected with SARS-CoV-2 will experience a loss of smell or taste by 11 percent. While some estimates suggest 4 out of 5 Covid patients regain these senses, research suggests the persistent inability or reduced ability to smell and taste impacts relationships, physical health and psychological well-being.

Researchers at the genomics and biotechnology company 23andMe conducted the study as part of a larger Covid project. All participants live in the U.S. or the United Kingdom.

Within a group of 69,841 individuals who self-reported receiving a positive Covid test, 68 percent reported a loss of smell or taste as a symptom. The loss of smell and taste were combined as a single survey question; this grouping and the use of self-reported data are limitations of the study.

After comparing the genetic differences between those who lost their sense of smell and those who reported that they did not suffer this effect, the study team found a region of the genome associated with this split that’s situated near two genes, UGT2A1 and UGT2A2. Both of these genes are expressed within tissue inside the nose involved in smell and play a role in metabolizing odorants.

“It was this really beautiful example of science where, starting with a large body of activated research participants who have done this 23andMe test, we were able to very quickly gain some biological insights into this disease that would otherwise be very, very difficult to do,” said Adam Auton, vice president of human genetics at 23andMe and the lead author of the study.

How UGT2A1 and UGT2A2 are involved in this process is unclear, though he and his colleagues hypothesize the genes “may play a role in the physiology of infected cells” and the resulting impairment that leads to smell loss.

To use these findings, scientists need to learn more about how these genes are expressed and what their functions are in olfactory signaling, Turner said.

Certain trends also emerged among the participants who reported the loss of smell and taste: Women, for example, were 11 percent more likely than men to experience this. Meanwhile, adults between the ages of 26 and 35 made up 73 percent of this group.

The study team also found people of “East Asian or African American ancestry were significantly less likely to report loss of smell or taste.” The cause of this observation is not yet known, but Auton said it’s likely not explained by the genetic variants of this specific locus. The team also notes the study is biased toward people of European ancestry because of limited reference data.

These findings can help patients in two ways, said Danielle Reed, associate director of the Monell Chemical Senses Center. She studies person-to-person differences in the loss of smell and taste due to Covid and was not a part of the new paper.

First, “it helps answer the question of ‘why me’ when it comes to taste and smell loss with Covid-19,” she said. “Some people have it and some do not. Inborn genetics may partially explain why.”

The study may also help scientists find treatments. Earlier research suggests the loss of these senses is related to a “failure to protect the sensory cells of the nose and tongue from viral infection,” Reed said.

“This study suggests a different direction,” she said. “The pathways that break down the chemicals that cause taste and smell in the first place might be over or underactive, reducing or distorting the ability to taste and smell.”

For most of the coronavirus pandemic, the loss of smell and taste have been known as signature symptoms. Early research suggests loss of smell and taste is rarer with the omicron variant, but not entirely unlikely: In a study of 81 omicron cases in Norway, 12 percent reported reduced smell and 23 reported reduced taste.","This genetic risk factor increases the likelihood a person infected with SARS-CoV-2 will experience a loss of smell or taste by 11 percent.

These are atypical tunnels which form on the intestinal walls or other organs. People with Crohn’s disease may experience fistulas forming in different parts of the intestines, with another organ, such as the bladder, or through to the skin surface. Individuals with fistulas may experience undesirable side effects, such as: diarrhea

pain

discomfort An anal fistula is the most common type of fistula. Symptoms include a tender swelling or lump around the anus that may drain and pain that gets worse with movement. Read this article to learn more about the different types of fistulas, including symptoms, causes, and treatment options.

Types of fistulas Share on Pinterest The Good Brigade/Getty Images Fistulas are very common in people with Crohn’s disease, affecting 1 in 3 individuals with the condition. A fistula is a narrow passage that occurs when inflammation causes sores, or ulcers, to form. These passages can connect one organ to another or to the outside surface of the body. Various types of fistulas can occur in different places in the body. These include: Anal (perianal): This fistula connects the anal canal or rectum to the surface of the skin close to the anus.

This fistula connects the anal canal or rectum to the surface of the skin close to the anus. Vaginal : There are different types of vaginal fistulas, which can atypically connect the vagina to the bladder, rectum, colon, or small intestine.

: There are different types of vaginal fistulas, which can atypically connect the vagina to the bladder, rectum, colon, or small intestine. Colovesical (bowel to bladder): A rare tract between the colon and bladder, which may allow fecal matter to appear in the urine.

This fistula the intestine to an adjacent organ or surface. Enterocutaneous (bowel to skin): An atypical tract between the intestinal tract or stomach and the skin. Diagnosing types of fistulas Diagnosing fistulas vary according to their type. A doctor will have to gather information, such as: where the fistula opens

the route of the fistula

how many tunnels are present

if the fistula goes through sphincter muscles

if there is an infection Read more from our IBD hub on the effects of Crohn’s.

Anal fistula An anal fistula is a small tunnel that develops between the end of the bowel and the skin near the anus. Symptoms of an anal fistula include: skin irritation around the anus

a throbbing pain that may worsen with movement, a bowel movement, or coughing

smelly discharge near the anus

passing pus or blood

swelling and redness around the anus

difficulty controlling bowel movements These symptoms are more likely to occur in people with Crohn’s disease. Other causes may include: diverticulitis

complications of surgery near the anus

infection with tuberculosis or HIV Diagnosis To diagnose this type of fistula, a doctor will conduct a physical examination of the skin surrounding the anus, as fistulas often present as small holes or red bumps. They may also press on the skin to determine if there is a leak of puss or feces. Medical professionals may perform the diagnosis under a general anesthetic so that the area is fully relaxed. Sometimes, doctors use a probe to determine where the fistula travels and if it goes through sphincter muscles. Several tests can also attempt to determine this, including: a pelvic MRI

endoanal ultrasound

fistulography, which involves using a dye in the anus to find signs of leakage Often, healthcare professionals use a combination of these techniques to assess a fistula.

Vaginal fistula A vaginal fistula is a tract or hole that has opened up from the vaginal wall and connects with another organ in the body. The most common types of vaginal fistula are: vesicovaginal, a tract connecting the vagina and the bladder

rectovaginal, a fistula connecting the vagina and the rectum

colovaginal, a tract that connects the vagina and the colon

enterovaginal, a fistula that connects the vagina and the small intestine Symptoms can include fluid leaking from the vagina, a smelling discharge of gas from the vaginal area, or an infection in the genital area. The fistula itself may not cause a person to experience any pain or discomfort. However, urine, feces, or wind may pass through the vagina which can lead to incontinence issues. The continuous leakage in the vaginal area can also lead to infection or soreness. A fistula usually develops after trauma occurs in the area, such as: surgery of the vagina, anus, or rectum

hysterectomy

inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), mainly Crohn’s disease

radiation therapy for pelvic cancer

damage due to childbirth such as a tear or infection Diagnosis Symptoms are the most helpful for doctors to assist with diagnosing a vaginal fistula. A doctor will discuss the symptoms and any surgery, trauma, or disease that could have caused it. For a physical exam, a healthcare professional will use a speculum to look at the vaginal walls. Similar to an anal fistula, diagnostic tests include an MRI, ultrasound, and fistulography, which involves adding dye to the vagina. Doctors can also perform a urinalysis or blood test to check for signs of infection.

Bowel to bladder fistula A bladder fistula, or colovesicular fistula, occurs when an opening forms between the bladder and another organ or the skin. The most common types of bladder fistulas occur between the bladder and the bowel or between the bladder and the vagina. Symptoms include: urine that looks or smells like stool

persistent urinary tract infections

gas coming from the urethra This type of fistula can occur as a result of Crohn’s, injury or trauma to the bladder, bowel or gynecologic cancer, or radiation therapy. Diagnosis To detect this type of fistula, a urologist will perform a physical exam and gather medical history. Doctors may place a long and thin camera in the urethra to see the bladder — a procedure known as cystoscopy. They may also use a test called a poppy seed test. This involves individuals eating poppy seeds — if they end up in the urine, it shows there is a fistula from the bowel to the bladder. X-rays or CT scans can also check the bladder and surrounding areas.

Bowel to skin fistula An enterocutaneous fistula, or bowel to skin fistula, is an atypical connection between the intestinal tract or stomach and the skin. As a result of this connection, contents of the stomach or intestines may leak through to the skin. Symptoms include diarrhea, dehydration, and malnutrition. These fistulas usually occur after bowel surgery, but other causes may include: perforated peptic ulcer

Crohn’s disease

abdominal injury or trauma, such as a stabbing or gunshot Diagnosis Tests, such as CT scans or a fistulogram, can also help doctors diagnose this type of fistula. A barium test, which involves individuals swallowing barium or taking it as an enema before an X-ray, can help confirm the presence of a fistula.

Treatment options Treating a fistula depends on the type of fistula present and whether the individual is receiving treatment for another bowel condition. People can manage most fistulas with medication, surgical procedures, or a combination of the two. Medications There are different medications that doctors will prescribe to individuals with fistulas. These include: antibiotics

biologic medications

steroids

laxatives, usually for anal fistulas Nonsurgical Fibrin glue is currently the only nonsurgical treatment for anal fistulas. It involves the surgeon injecting glue into the fistula while under a general anesthetic. The glue helps seal the fistula and encourages it to heal. This treatment is generally less effective than surgical procedures, and the results may not be long lasting. It may be a useful option for fistulas that pass through the anal sphincter muscles because they do not require cutting. Surgical Doctors can remove fistulas can via different surgical procedures, including: Fistulotomy: This is an effective strategy for treating most fistulas. However, doctors cannot perform the procedure when the fistula crosses the anal sphincter muscles.

Transanal mucosal advancement flap: This method involves removing the fistula and covering the hole with a flap of tissue from inside the rectum. However, this procedure has a lower success rate than a fistulotomy.

This method involves removing the fistula and covering the hole with a flap of tissue from inside the rectum. However, this procedure has a lower success rate than a fistulotomy. Ligation of the intersphincteric tract (LIFT): Doctors make a cut in the skin above the fistula and move apart the sphincter muscles. While LIFT has had some promising results so far, with fistula closure rates of 57–94%, more research is necessary to determine its short- and long-term success.

Plug: This is a cone-shaped plug consisting of animal tissue that blocks the internal opening of the fistula. It is a suitable alternative for simple fistulas but has a high failure rate when doctors perform this procedure in individuals with complex fistula or Crohn’s disease. The plug also has a lower risk of postoperative impairment and complications.

This treatment involves using a small laser beam to seal the fistula. There are uncertainties around how well it works, but there are no major safety concerns. Seton placement: A common treatment for anal fistulas that involves placing a seton, a thin rubber drain, in the fistula, which allows the tunnel to slowly heal. Often, doctors place a series of these over time for gradual healing. What to expect from the procedures Currently, none of the procedures for fistulas have a guaranteed success rate. However, the success rate of many of these procedures is generally high, with 1 in 3 of people having a fistula relapse. This means that individuals may need more than one operation to try to treat their fistula.

Questions to ask a doctor If a person has a fistula and is considering a surgical option, they should consult a doctor. The following are questions to ask a healthcare professional about procedures to correct fistulas. What is the success rate of each surgical option?

What are the side effects?

If there is a fistula relapse, what would be the next step?

About how much time passes between a surgical option and a fistula relapse?

What can I do to help ensure the procedure is successful?

Alternatives If treatment fails, a person should make an appointment with their doctor so that they can plan for alternative treatment options. Doctors may recommend another procedure or recommend allowing some time between each procedure. They will also suggest certain lifestyle changes — according to the type of fistula a person has — to help minimize symptoms and improve quality of life.

Outlook Fistulas are not life threatening, but they can negatively impact the quality of life of those who have one. A person should acknowledge any symptoms they may have and try to prepare in advance for their daily activities to make management easier. For example, they can try sitting on cushions or pillows if they have pain when sitting. Another option is wearing loose-fitting clothes and cotton underwear. If a person has any questions or is in need of suggestions, they should speak with their doctor.","Anal fistula An anal fistula is a small tunnel that develops between the end of the bowel and the skin near the anus.

219,219,https://newleftreview.org/sidecar/posts/news-from-natoland,"Tariq Ali, News from Natoland — Sidecar","Since 3 December 2021, when the Washington Post ‘broke’ the story – based on some aerial photos of tents in a field and other helpfully selected nuggets of US intelligence – the Anglophone world has been subjected to a highly orchestrated media campaign, trumpeting at top volume the ‘massive’ and ‘imminent’ Russian invasion of Ukraine. In the absence of any actual news to report, unnamed US security officials are wheeled out like clockwork to issue pronouncements, NATO figures (Stoltenberg, Borrell) are pushed forward to fill any gaps. Daily front-page headlines hammering home the threat of war have been backed by a loyal chorus of opinion-makers, remarkably unanimous in their views.

Sotto voce, the cat had already been let out of the bag as to the Biden Administration’s main goals. American officials were ‘pushing European countries’ to create a ‘common prescription’ against Russia, a New York Times piece heavily briefed by US security had announced three weeks before. In London, the broadsheet press jumped to, the Financial Times reliably out-hawking Washington, with the Economist piping up alongside. Even the LRB felt obliged to join in with a particularly aggressive piece, whose author was apparently unaware that Georgia, not Russia, had invaded South Ossetia in 2008.

What tropes do the warmongers offer? First, Putin is the unilateral source of aggression, mobilizing a vast invasion force out of the blue for ‘imminent’ action. Second, NATO’s expansion is non-negotiable. Third, it is impermissible under the ‘rules-based [read: US-led] international order’ for borders to be redrawn by force. Fourth, national sovereignty must be inviolate; Ukraine must determine its own foreign policy. What are the realities?

First, far from unilateral, the Russian force is the same as that mobilized last spring in response to NATO’s two-month ‘Defender Europe’ exercise, involving 28,000 American and European troops on Russia’s borders, backed by ostentatiously aggressive US-UK naval operations in the Black Sea. The Russian counter-mobilization on its own side of the border was, as the US acknowledged at the time, ‘standard operating procedure’.

Moscow was also alarmed when the Biden Administration winked at the Ukrainian military’s use of drone warfare in the Donbas in October 2021, when aerial weapons were strictly prohibited by the Minsk agreements – and the lethal escalatory effects of drones had just been demonstrated by Azerbaijan’s 2020 war on Nagorno Karabakh. The Biden Administration had also stepped up NATO exercises in Ukraine itself – the summer 2021 Cossack Mace exercise in the south, between Odessa and Crimea, for example.

Militarily, in a broader perspective it is NATO’s forces that have been on the offensive, advancing 800 miles eastward over the last thirty years, deep inside the borders of the former Soviet Union and now penetrating the Russian-speaking heartlands. The Kremlin proved at first gullible and slow-witted in responding to this, both Yeltsin and Putin willing to swallow US assurances, and then – after the Bush-Blair 2008 diplomatic thrust to expand NATO to Ukraine and Georgia – often inept and clumsy in formulating a more resolute response.

But NATO expansion – subordinating the advanced-capitalist European heartlands to US military command – is a voluntarist imperial strategy, not a question of national defence. Ideologically and strategically, Washington’s liberal-international militarism – dividing the world into ‘good’ and ‘bad’ states and pledging to regime-change the latter – is a recipe for war, as Stephen Walt has argued. The commentariat’s cry – ‘no sphere of influence for Russia!’ – neglects to add that this is because the US presumes to command a global sphere. Where US interests collude, redrawing borders by force is not a problem – viz. the green light for Turkey’s occupation of northern Syria, not to mention Cyprus, or Israel’s of southern Lebanon and the Golan Heights, or the de facto US-Israeli protectorate in northern Iraq. Relatedly, under the ‘rules-based order’, national sovereignty is at Washington’s bequest. The vice-regal language of operatives like Victoria Nuland, selecting Ukraine’s next prime minister after the toppling of pro-Russian Yanukovych in 2014, speaks volumes about realities on the ground.

Amid the general hysteria, we should welcome even mildly dissenting voices. In addition to Walt, Simon Jenkins warns that NATO’s treatment of Russia virtually guaranteed a chauvinist reflex. Like Anatol Lieven, Jenkins argues that the way forward lay in implementing the confederal constitutional arrangements of the Minsk accords – largely blocked by Kiev’s objections to Donbas ‘home rule’ – plus an end to NATO expansionism, Russian withdrawal and the reinstatement of Ukraine’s borders. Countering narratives of unilateral Russian aggression, Adam Tooze extends the analysis he first developed in Crashed. Anatomizing ‘sphere of influence’ realities, Peter Beinart calls for de facto recognition that Ukraine will remain a buffer state. Rajan Menon and Thomas Graham have proposed a moratorium of 20-25 years on Ukraine’s NATO membership. Robert Kaplan calls for Finlandization. Ross Douthat ponders how the Biden Administration could conduct a successful retreat.

More analytically, David Hendrickson has highlighted the ‘super-aggressive but also super-cautious’ approach of the Biden Administration, following the script of Anders Åslund and others at the hardline Atlantic Council to ‘restore Moscow’s respect for the international rules-based order’ – further militarization of the region under NATO, step-by-step integration of Ukraine in the outer circles of NATO membership, putting the Crimea and Donbas back on the table and ending Nord Stream 2 – with a focus on Ukraine ‘from day one’, as a Biden official said, while at the same time, under pressure from the China hawks, avoiding any large-scale commitment of US forces. That meant gearing up the Old World allies for action.

If the British media has been the most frenzied in Europe, UK politicians have followed suit. Johnson’s warmongering – and Labour leader Keir Starmer’s avid backing for it – was analysed here by Oliver Eagleton. Now Starmer has launched an attack on the UK peace movement, Stop the War – one of the few groups to organize against the current escalation. Assuring Guardian readers that ‘Labour’s commitment to NATO is unshakable’ – as if the party’s shameful Cold War and Blairite record left any room for doubt – Starmer rails that Stop the War is ‘giving succour to authoritarian leaders’ and ‘showing solidarity with the aggressor’.

This is the tired old slogan raised against the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament in the 1950s and the Vietnam Solidarity Campaign in the 60s. In the latter case, those of us who founded the VSC were proud to stand with the Vietnamese people against the US bombers and napalm. Many of us opposed both the entry of Soviet troops to crush the Hungarian uprising in 1956 and the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. My own position on Afghanistan was to oppose both the Soviet occupation in December 1979 and NATO’s ‘Operation Enduring Freedom’ in 2001 (see The Forty-Year War in Afghanistan, Verso 2021).

The millions who marched in Europe and the US in 2003 against the coming invasion of Iraq were not supporters of Saddam, whose authoritarian regime had been nurtured, cultivated and armed for many decades by the United States and its NATO allies. They rightly foresaw the carnage and destruction Bush and Blair would be inflicting on the Middle East and fought to stop it. Do Starmer and MI5 regard Simon Jenkins as a sinister figure in hock to Putin? And let’s not forget the support given by NATO members to the royal torturers and killers who rule Morocco and Saudi Arabia today, inflicting the bloodbath on Yemen. If moral grandstanding is the basis for war, why didn’t the London blowhards stay on in Afghanistan?

Let’s revive a few more memories. Who backed Putin’s murderous assault on Chechnya in 1999-2000, and watched contentedly as its capital Grozny was razed to the ground? Clinton and Blair did – the latter rushing to Moscow to be the first to congratulate Putin on his subsequent election victory – with other NATO members looking on. Russia was then considered a loyal subordinate, since it backed the West on most issues – not least throwing open its bases to aid the NATO occupation of Afghanistan. Tony Wood’s fine analysis in NLR provides chapter and verse on Putin’s role in the Chechen tragedy as well as the collusion of NATO members at the time.

What has changed is that NATO’s auto-pilot expansionism has put it on course to swallow Ukraine and Georgia, which Russian raison d’état is bound to resist. At the same time, Russia’s blundering militarized response may have served to weaken its hand by throwing away the strongest card it held in Ukraine – the friendship of the Russian-speaking or Russia-oriented half of the population. In 2008, when Bush and Blair pushed through NATO’s ‘open door’ policy to Ukraine and Georgia at the Bucharest summit, barely 20% of Ukrainians supported joining NATO. The majority was split between supporting a military alliance with Russia or maintaining the neutral status enshrined in Ukraine’s 1990s constitution (it was altered by the Zelensky government in 2019 to set national goals of EU and NATO membership).

By 2014, after the Maidan uprising, Russian annexation of Crimea and the ongoing low-level war in the Donbas region, support for NATO had risen to 40%, but with another 40% of Ukrainians still against. (Ukrainian pollsters now excluded the populous Donbas and Crimea regions, which also affected the figures.) In the western regions – more integrated into EU economic networks via migrant workers in Poland – there is now majority support for joining NATO. But as Volodymyr Ishchenko has written, many Ukrainians feel that NATO membership would forfeit still more of Ukraine’s sovereignty while increasing tensions with Russia, escalating internal divisions among Ukrainians and dragging the country into another of the US’s ‘forever wars’, one of which has just ended in humiliating defeat.

The Western media attack-dogs have been congratulating themselves that, whatever else, their propaganda onslaught has united NATO. Not quite. The relentless spotlight of the past twelve weeks has also shown up its fissures. Germany’s chief naval officer, Admiral Kay-Achim Schönbach, was forced to resign after telling a military think-tank in New Delhi that all Putin really wanted was a little respect: ‘My God, give him respect! That costs so little, really nothing at all. It is easy to pay him the respect which he desires and really deserves. Russia is an ancient country, Russia is an important country. Even we, India, Germany, need Russia, we need Russia against China.’

The admiral was posing a Maoist-Althusserian question: the NATO masters of war must decide between Russia and China – which is the primary and which the secondary contradiction? Nixon’s visit to Beijing undoubtedly helped to weaken the Soviet Union. Yet the West-China collaboration made the PRC the political-economic force it is today and re-subordinating it will be difficult, if not impossible. Given the Biden family’s lucrative involvement in Ukrainian affairs, not to mention the Clinton-DLC investment in the bogey of Russian trolls swinging the 2016 election, the current administration is unlikely to attempt a parallel move in Moscow. Washington still seems bent on forging a pan-Eurasian counter-hegemonic alliance. Putin and Xi duly issued a joint statement from the Beijing Winter Olympics against the expansion of NATO and deepening economic ties, not least increasing Russian gas imports to China.

The official response to Admiral Schönbach was swift. The new German Minister of Defence, Christine Lambrecht, a Social Democrat in the Starmer mould, suspended Schönbach immediately from all duties and titles. Embarrassingly, however, the retired General Harald Kujat, a senior figure in the German armed forces and former Chair of NATO’s Military Committee, then gave a TV interview (that rapidly disappeared online): ‘If I were still in office I would have stood up for Admiral Schönbach, and tried in every way to prevent his dismissal… it must be in our interest to achieve a sensible result, to de-escalate and arrive at a relaxation of tension with Russia, of course with consideration of Ukrainian security interests as well.’ Even within Natoland there are differences: Johnson-Starmer preach war-war, many Germans favour jaw-jaw.

British posturing is designed mainly to stress to the White House and Pentagon that a Brexited Britain can be even more loyal than in Blairite times. The dog-like coital lock could be permanently sealed with cement. Meanwhile, Starmer accusing Stop the War of supporting authoritarians shines a light on his own politics. He will do whatever he’s asked to by the British state. If tomorrow Putin is designated a friend, Starmer will go along. He certainly knows something about authoritarianism himself, having expelled dozens of dissident Jews from the Labour Party and suspended his radical predecessor on spurious charges. In McCarthyite fashion, he might proscribe the peace movement altogether and try to force its Labour supporters to quit. He could go further than Blair by making support for NATO a necessary pre-condition for party membership. It would be just an extension of weaponizing anti-Semitism and effectively outlawing criticisms of Israel.

Stop the War is not a political party. It has Tory supporters, as well as many who favour Scottish independence. Its aim is to stop wars waged by the US or NATO, whatever the pretext. The politicians and the arms merchants who back these wars do so not to enhance democracy, but to serve the hegemonic interests of the world’s largest imperial power. Stop the War and many others will carry on the task of opposing them despite threats, slanders or blandishments.

For more than a decade, Bradford resident Beth Vanstone has been advocating on behalf of Cystic Fibrosis (CF) and Rare Disease patients after her daughter Madi was diagnosed with CF at just eight months old in 2001.

On February 28, which is Rare Disease Day, Vanstone and Madi spent the day advocating alongside the Canadian Organization for Rare Diseases (CORD) at Queen’s Park, where they met with MPPs to discuss the need for a Rare Disease Drug Strategy (RDDS).

On Wednesday, March 22 the mother-daughter duo got the news they’ve been waiting so long to hear.

Minister of Health, Jean-Yves Duclos, announced measures in support of the first-ever National Strategy for Drugs for Rare Diseases, with an investment of up to $1.5 billion over three years.

“We are very excited about the launch of the RDDS, we feel the door has been opened to make the changes needed for those who suffer from a rare disease,” said Vanstone. “When Madi was very sick with Cystic Fibrosis and looking at a possible lung transplant, we quickly learned how very flawed our system is. It took Madi nearly two years to gain access to a drug (Kalydeco), which has saved her life. We have watched helplessly as others have not gained access to a drug that would save their life. Canadians deserve better.”

In Canada, one out of 12 people—many of whom are children—has a rare disease. There are thousands of different rare diseases that affect patients, their families and caregivers across the country. Unfortunately, treatments are only available for a small percentage of these conditions. Even when treatments that might dramatically improve the quality of a patient's life are available, they are often unaffordable and out of reach.

As part of this overall investment, the Government of Canada will make available up to $1.4 billion to provinces and territories through bilateral agreements. This funding will help provinces and territories improve access to new and emerging drugs, as well as support enhanced access to existing drugs, early diagnosis, and screening for rare diseases.

""Access and affordability should never be a barrier to care,” said Duclos in a statement. “Through this new strategy, Canadians living with a rare disease will soon have improved screening and diagnostics, and better access to affordable and effective treatments they need, no matter where they live.”

The announcement is the result of feedback from extensive consultation that garnered diverse perspectives from over 650 individuals and organizations, including patients with lived experience, as well as caregivers and family members.

“Madi and I have been working towards a Rare Disease Drug Strategy since we realized how difficult it was for Rare Disease patients to access lifesaving treatments back in 2012,” explained Vanstone. “There are many who have been working towards this goal including CORD.""

For its part, CORD said it too welcomes the new drug funding announcement, calling it a major step to value-based pharmacare and healthcare.

“CORD is especially gratified that the federal government heard our recommendations for a comprehensive strategy that includes investment in infrastructure, including centres of expertise, that will facilitate faster diagnosis and treatment access with on-going patient monitoring and data collection,"" said Durhane Wong-Rieger, CORD President & CEO.

“For decades, Canada has been one of the only developed countries without a national rare disease plan, Wong-Rieger noted. “With this announcement, Canada has the opportunity to implement the very best program in the world for rare disease patients.”

Vanstone believes with proper implementation the long delays to access may soon be eliminated.

“Canadians will have equal access to lifesaving treatments regardless of their postal code. (As funding is often provincial, you may or may not have access due to the province you live in.) These are just two of the many issues that can be addressed by the RDDS,” she said.

In addition, Duclos says this strategy will “improve the collection and use of evidence and strengthen investments in critical research and innovation in rare diseases.”

Vanstone says it’s a wonderful start.

“The next steps include meeting with the provinces to have them coordinate with the federal government to provide the best possible impact for patients,"" she said. ""We hope to be a voice in helping government recognize the specific needs of the Rare Disease community.”

Vanstone and her daughter Madi will be in Ottawa next week at The Rare Disease Drug Conference to meet with MPs and others in the Rare Disease community to detail specific needs.

“This is a big opportunity and we look forward to finding a better pathway for Canadians living with Rare Disease in the near future.”

The FDA approved Pharming’s leniolisib, now to be marketed as Joenja, for the treatment of the ultra-rare disease-activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) syndrome (APDS), the company announced Friday.

Joenja is the first drug approved in the U.S. in this indication and is scheduled to launch in early April.

Data from a Phase II/III trial supported Joenja’s New Drug Application, showing that Joenja could address immune dysregulation and normalize the immune phenotype in 31 patients with APDS 12 years and older.

Compared with placebo, Joenja led to a significantly greater reduction in lymph node size and improved naïve B cell counts by 37%, both of which indicate a “correction of the underlying immune defect,” the FDA wrote in its approval announcement.

As for safety, typical side effects associated with Joenja were headache, sinusitis and atopic dermatitis. These findings are reflected in the drug’s label, which also carries a warning for embryo-fetal toxicity. Joenja is also not advisable for patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment or for breastfeeding women.

The FDA evaluated Joenja under priority review and had previously granted it Orphan Drug and Rare Pediatric Disease designations.

Leniolisib is also being reviewed by the European Medicines Agency, with an opinion from the Committee for Human Medicinal Products expected in the second half of 2023.

APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency caused by mutations in either the PIK3CD or PIK3R1 genes, which are essential for immune cells' normal development and function. Variations in these genes hyperactivate the PI3Kδ pathway, leading to the immune system's dysregulation and deficiency.

APDS has no cure; patients rely on symptomatic treatment. Joenja’s approval will open new treatment opportunities for these patients.

Speaking at the closing of the Citizens’ Panel on Employment Resilience, Mr Wong said the government will redouble efforts to help every Singaporean reskill, upskill and transit more easily to take up new job opportunities.

He noted that Singapore does not seek to protect the job, as this will only hold back the process of innovation, as well as hinder the creation of new and better jobs.

Some jobs will become obsolete because of innovation and technical advancements, he said. However, new jobs will also be created, which will usually be more productive and pay better wages, he added.

He cited the example of maintenance workers, who used to have to slowly climb the exterior of buildings to conduct inspections. Now, a properly trained drone pilot can do the same task in a faster and safer way.

“In a dynamic and healthy economy, there will always be a flow of innovation, new ideas and new ways of doing things, that is to be expected,” said Mr Wong, who is also the finance minister.

“In fact, we want that to happen in a healthy economy.”

Mr Wong also said sometimes the new jobs created are within the same company, taking over obsolete jobs.

“But in many cases, you will find that the new jobs are being offered by more competitive firms in the same sector,” he said.

“Or, for that matter, in an entirely different sector – like what we have seen in recent years, where there has been a lot of demand for data and software engineers because of technological advancements.

“The Tinder Swindler” follows three women who said they were conned by Leviev, an Israeli man they all met separately on Tinder sometime in 2018 or 2019.

In the documentary, the women alleged that Leviev — whose real name is Shimon Hayut — claimed he was the son of a wealthy tycoon, took them out on extravagant dates and started relationships with them before he eventually scammed them out of large sums of money.

At the time of its release Feb. 2, ""The Tinder Swindler"" said Hayut was back on Tinder — which the company denied in a statement.

Hayut was also banned from using dating sites and apps under Match Group Inc., including Match.com, Plenty of Fish and OkCupid, she said.

Attempts to reach Netflix and Hayut for comment were unsuccessful Tuesday.

Hayut did not appear in the documentary, but a voice message the filmmakers said he sent them was included in the film.

“I will proceed with the lawsuit against you for defamation and lies and, you know, that everything is based, basically, on a lie. And that’s it, this is how it’s gonna be,” Hayut said in the voice message.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.

CNN —

Deadly spores lurk in the water and infect the skin of the creatures they touch. Spreading on contact and then invading the body, this fungal disease causes ulcers and peeling so severe skin comes off in sheets.

Joints in the leg begin to lock up, and, shortly after symptoms set in, the disorder can lead to cardiac arrest and death.

Chytridiomycosis, the most deadly disease afflicting vertebrates in recorded history, has wreaked havoc on amphibians for decades, including frogs, toads and salamanders.

The illness isn’t known to infect humans, but scientists warn these outbreaks are crucial to understanding how fungal pathogens spread and learning how to wrap our heads around a mass extinction event plaguing our amphibious friends.

The ailment has already decimated amphibian populations in the Americas, Australia and parts of Europe, and the latest research has shown it may now be making its way across Africa. The disease may be killing off animals in hordes without scientists realizing, warned Dr. Vance Vredenburg, a professor of biology at San Francisco State University and a research associate at the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology at the University of California, Berkeley.

“There could be hundreds of species (in Africa) that could be imperiled by this pathogen,” said Vredenburg, coauthor of a new study published March 15 in Frontiers in Conservation Science that reveals the pervasiveness of chytridiomycosis in Africa for the first time.

For amphibians, the disease is making the Black Death that devastated Europe in the Middle Ages “look like a drop in the bucket,” Vredenburg said.

Why it matters

Chytridiomycosis is caused by a pathogen called Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, or Bd for short. The disease has been a major contributor to the threat of extinction facing amphibian species worldwide. About 41% of amphibians are currently in danger, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List of Threatened Species.

Understanding Bd and how it spreads has been a major focus of Vredenburg’s career. He began studying the pathogen in the late 1990s, tracking Bd across the world and watching its deadly impact. He recalled visiting the Sierra Nevada between 2004 and 2008, where he witnessed a particularly brutal outbreak and “watched thousands of frogs die in front of my eyes due to this disease.”

Scientists did not believe that a fungal pathogen could (affect) hundreds of species. But in fact, the nightmare story is true. Dr. Vance Vredenburg, biology professor at San Francisco State University

“Honestly, before it happened, I didn’t believe it,” he said. “Scientists did not believe that a fungal pathogen could (affect) hundreds of species. But in fact, the nightmare story is true. This single pathogen has caused the biggest die-off of vertebrates that’s ever been recorded.”

Vredenburg said it has “changed the way that scientists view diseases and their ability to really control wildlife populations.”

In locations where scientists have more thoroughly observed Bd’s devastating impact, the “disease has caused the decline or complete extinction of over 200 species of frogs and other amphibians,” according to Cornell University’s Wildlife Health Lab.

Scientists previously thought that amphibians in Africa had been relatively spared Bd’s scourge. But Vredenburg set out to see if the pathogen was present in museum specimens of amphibians from Africa and enlisted colleagues abroad to collect live samples in the wild. He also pored through previous studies from the continent. All told, more than 16,900 animals were analyzed.

Signs of Bd in Africa were low — below 5% — from the 1930s through the late 1990s, the study found. Then cases exploded.

Infection rates jumped to more than 17% and again to nearly 22% in the 2010s. The most severe outbreaks appeared to be in places where scientists had the most data, including in countries such as Burundi, where infection rates topped 73%.

Those rates are concerning, Vredenburg added, because they could signal amphibian populations are dying out in droves.

“Unless you’re really watching, you might not notice that they’re gone until they’re already gone,” he said. “We really should understand why it’s such a problem in these vertebrates. They’ve been around for 400 million years.”

The million-dollar question for scientists is why there is such a sudden and dramatic threat to their existence, Vredenburg said.

The hidden threat of Bd

How amphibian populations are grappling with the disease is difficult to pin down. Most frogs and their ilk are nocturnal, so humans don’t always come into contact with them as they get sick. The pathogen is also swift, killing the infected shortly after symptoms begin. And amphibian bodies decompose quickly, Vredenburg added, erasing evidence of a mass die-off before scientists can discover the corpses.

However, Bd doesn’t always trigger a deadly outbreak, a positive — but perplexing — fact that researchers considered in the new study. The pathogen can be found in some populations of frogs that manage to survive, much as humans adapt to pandemics.

The amphibians that the study authors swabbed in Africa, Vredenburg noted, did not always display physical symptoms of the disease, though they tested positive for Bd. Those populations could still wind up dead, or they may have a natural defense against the disease. And that’s part of the reason Vredenburg is urging continued study of the disease’s presence on the continent.

Scientists have also been able to treat and immunize frogs in captivity, Vredenburg added, though it would be virtually impossible to attempt to do so in the wild. Frogs, of course, can’t coordinate global vaccine distribution as humans can in pandemic times.

Bd’s spread and impact

There are certain steps that scientists said humans should be taking to mitigate the spread of Bd. Vredenburg noted that the fungus can spread through the exotic animal trade if an amphibian is captured in one location and then released back into the wild somewhere else. Stopping those sorts of trade can help thwart Bd’s spread.

Once Bd appears in any given location, it spreads on contact. Frogs can contract chytridiomycosis from the pathogen by swimming in infested waters, where the fungus lives, or brushing up against another infected animal.

Amphibian populations are already at risk because of habitat loss, noted biologist Dr. JJ Apodaca, executive director of the US nonprofit Amphibian and Reptile Conservancy, who was not involved in the new study. Apodaca said the study offered valuable new insight into how such a devastating pathogen has spread.

The disease is “the straw that’s breaking a lot of backs” when it comes to amphibian conservation, he said. “When the animals get stressed from habitat loss, all of those things kind of come together, and then the disease comes in and finishes it.”

Apodaca is focusing on populations of frogs and other amphibians in the United States, but learning about how Bd is spreading in Africa helps to understand the pathogen’s origins and what causes outbreaks.

“My biggest desire would be that people simply understood that these problems exist,” Apodaca added. Threats such as Bd will “get some big flash in the pan news event and then the next day, it’s the next problem. … But meanwhile, our wildlife, our native amphibians and reptiles are just getting hammered.”","Spreading on contact and then invading the body, this fungal disease causes ulcers and peeling so severe skin comes off in sheets.

Before he was four years old, he already had two liver transplants. Now 16, he has survived several painful, near-fatal experiences.

The Singaporean teenager has a rare genetic disorder known as Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD), which is estimated to affect one in 185,000 infants worldwide.

People with the genetic disorder cannot break down branched chain amino acids, which are formed when the body digests protein food such as milk — the main sustenance for babies.

The rare disease can be deadly if treatment is not given in time. One of the symptoms is a distinctive sweet-smelling urine, hence its name.

Associate Professor Denise Goh from National University Hospital (NUH) said that in Singapore, three cases of MSUD were picked up during newborn screening between July 2006 and September 2020.

She is the head of division of paediatric genetics and metabolism at NUH’s Khoo Teck Puat – National University Children’s Medical Institute.

Sage’s rare disease was not detected at birth. His mother, Mrs Cindy Tan, 50, said that the late diagnosis — two weeks after he was born — affected some parts of his brain.

Elevation of leucine — one of the branched chain amino acids that cannot be broken down in a person with MSUD — can cause brain damage, Assoc Prof Goh said.

Mrs Tan, who works as a freelance arts instructor, said that when Sage was born in 2005, newborn screening tests for rare metabolic disorders such as MSUD was not available.

Despite his multiple brushes with death and struggles with several health challenges, the resilient boy remains undaunted and upbeat.

He and his mother spoke to TODAY over a Zoom interview to raise awareness of rare diseases on Rare Disease Day, which was earlier this week on Feb 28.

Sage is studying at Spectra Secondary School and will be taking his N-Levels this year.

A Club Rainbow (Singapore) beneficiary since he was two years old, Sage has taken part in various fundraising activities hosted by the non-profit organisation. It supports children with chronic illnesses.

The most recent activity took place last year. For a charity event called Ride for Rainbows, Sage cycled a distance of around 75km over several days with his father Thomas Tan, 50, a business development manager.

Cycling long distances is not easy for Sage. He took a whole year to learn to ride on a two-wheel bicycle, but he never thought of giving up.

Sage has high muscle tone around the ankles, which makes it tougher for him to flex his ankles. The condition is related to his brain being affected by an untreated MSUD in the early days, Mrs Tan said.

As a baby, he took a longer time than his peers to sit up, crawl and walk.

Sage said: “When I was cycling, I told myself that we (my dad and I) had to keep moving on. I wanted to help raise more funds for other kids so that they join Club Rainbow, too.”

Club Rainbow (Singapore) is now supporting 183 children with rare diseases and their families, who make up 16 per cent of its beneficiaries. It also supports children with neurological disorders and developmental issues.","The Singaporean teenager has a rare genetic disorder known as Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD), which is estimated to affect one in 185,000 infants worldwide.

When the pandemic first hit us and the circuit breaker was implemented, the psychological reactions towards working from home were polarised.

On one hand, many appreciated not having to endure the stress of the rush hour. Patients told me they were delighted to be able to wake up naturally, have time to exercise and enjoy a leisurely breakfast before starting work.

Parents were able to spend more time with their children, and children who were caregivers were able to manage the needs of their elderly parents better.

Psychologically, these patients appreciated the added bandwidth resulting from the lack of commute and reported a decrease in their anxieties.

Individuals who had psychological difficulties taking public commutes due to anxiety disorders such as claustrophobia or panic disorder were able to cope better. Not having to worry about being trapped in an enclosed space in the train or the bus, some patients succeeded in taking on a job for the first time in their lives.

But not having to commute and working from home has also had its drawbacks, leaving some people feeling isolated and lonely. For employees with family, work can sometimes be the only legitimate reason they can give themselves (or their spouse) to leave home and get some alone time.

When the line between home and office became blurred, some found it difficult to have a proper routine or to get away from work. This resulted in them neglecting their meals, sleep, and even toilet breaks.

In a survey conducted by the American Psychiatric Association in 2021, the majority of respondents who worked from home said they found not going to the office problematic.

Nearly two-thirds of those surveyed said they feel isolated or lonely working from home at least sometimes, while 17 per cent said they felt that way all the time.

More than two-thirds of employees who worked from home at least part of the time reported they had trouble getting away from work at the end of the day always (22 per cent) or sometimes (45 per cent).

Younger adults (73 per cent of 18- to 29-year-olds and 73 per cent of 30- to 44-year-olds) were more likely to report feeling isolated or lonely working at home compared to older adults (48 per cent of 45- to 64-year-olds).","When the pandemic first hit us and the circuit breaker was implemented, the psychological reactions towards working from home were polarised.

This could be traced to late presentation of the child for screening and test, as most children affected by TB tend to be asymptomatic. Investigations have shown that childhood TB is underdiagnosed and underreported, and care is often accessed too late, resulting in adverse treatment outcomes.

TB affects the lungs, but it can also affect other parts of the body, such as the lymph glands, brain, kidneys or spine. It is more common for children to have TB that affects multiple parts of the body than it is for adults, and TB is likely to be more serious in children.

TB, a disease spread through the air, is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis and has killed 1.6 million people globally according to the World Health Organisations (WHO) report in 2021, placing it as one of the top 10 causes of deaths worldwide.

It added that the death rate (per 100,000) in Nigeria was at 53 percent with a growing incidence of drug resistant TB among the general population.

The Minister of Health, Osagie Ehanire had said that Nigeria reported about 207,000 cases of tuberculosis in 2021, with 12,977 cases affecting children.

In Akwa Ibom State, however, a TB expert and programme Manager of the State TB Programme, Dr Bassey Akpan in an interaction with journalists in commemoration of the World Tuberculosis Day with the theme, ‘Yes We Can End TB’ revealed that Akwa Ibom recorded 6400 cases of TB in 2021 and 6655 cases in 2022.

He said out of the number of affected persons, 12 percent of them were children.

He lamented the prevalence of TB among children, saying that immunisation of children was the best prevention against the deadly disease.

Akpan advised parents to ensure that their new born babies are given Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) after birth as it remains the cheapest and most effective way of managing infection.

He also harped on good nutrition for children, especially the intake of protein foods so that they would not be susceptible to TB, even as he recommended good ventilation and house spacing.

According to him, “Out of the number of TB patients in Akwa Ibom, 12% of them are children. Children are difficult to diagnose like adults because they don’t produce sputum but we collect their stool as a sample for a test.

“Children are vulnerable to TB because their immune system is not very strong; therefore, parents should immunise their children with BCG when they are born. BCG is the cheapest and most effective way of managing infection.”

He also advised parents to be cautious of their caregivers or persons who come around to touch their babies, especially those with persistent cough, recalling how a 13-month-old baby diagnosed with drug resistant TB was infected by someone around.

He narrated, “I remember a little boy who was 13 months old was diagnosed with TB, not just TB but drug resistant TB. It was difficult for us because we have not really captured that a child of that age will have drug resistant TB and we could not find the source immediately because both parents have drug sensitive TB, while the baby had drug resistant TB.

“That child did not get the infection from the parents but from someone around.

“We have to be careful of our caregivers, especially those coughing. The bad part is that the children who have it most times do not even cough because cough is an immunity reflex. They come looking pale, weak, lean no matter what you feed them. When you notice this, you take the child to hospital for urgent screening, test and treatment which is free.”

Akpan said TB can be successfully treated by taking the full course of antibiotics as prescribed by a doctor within six months for adults and six months for children even as he warned that though TB is curable, it does not confer immunity, saying that just like malaria one can be reinfected if he exposes himself to an infected person.

While hoping for budgetary allocation and releases for TB programmes in the State, Akpan said the state government had embarked on a programme of finding more TB cases to place those diagnosed to be positive on treatment which he said was free.

Akpan further advised, “People should check their housing to have good ventilation, no overcrowding.

“Those living with HIV or diabetes should take their medications regularly. People that take steroids are vulnerable to TB because steroids suppress immunity.”

Earlier, the Akwa Ibom State Coordinator of USAID-Breakthrough Action Nigeria, BAN, Mr Bassey Nsa pledged to intensify advocacy on behavioural change towards TB with the aim of ending TB by 2030.","Despite the availability of its effective cure, Tuberculosis (TB) remains a leading cause of death in children.

New infection waves are expected to occur periodically and MOH said it will continue to closely monitor the local situation and any emergence of new variants.

“More importantly, we also monitor the severity and potential impact on our healthcare system,” it added.

Singapore has seen a rise in the number of weekly COVID-19 infections, with the number of cases per week exceeding 10,000 in the two weeks leading up to Mar 18.

This is more than double that for the preceding two weeks, which recorded below 4,500 cases per week.

The number of COVID-19 infections is estimated based on the National ARI (Acute Respiratory Infection) Surveillance Programme, according to the MOH website.

The National ARI Surveillance Programme includes the average daily number of ARI attendances at polyclinics. The average daily number of patients seeking ARI treatment in the polyclinics was recorded at 2,592 for the week of Mar 12 to Mar 18, and 2,823 the week before.

Health Minister Ong Ye Kung also spoke about the increase in COVID-19 infections, in response to a comment made on his Instagram post.

“Important thing is (the) severity of symptoms. Today, (the) number of COVID-19-related hospitalisations is very low, and far lower than non-COVID-19-related infections. So we can treat COVID-19 as an endemic disease,” he said.

“But we will continue to monitor closely to make sure we stay on the right track.”

MOH also said that as of Mar 26, 2023, no cases of XBB.1.16 have been detected in Singapore.

XBB.1.16 is the emerging, predominant Omicron subvariant that has been reported in India.

“There is also currently no evidence internationally that XBB.1.16 exhibits greater transmissibility or severity than previously identified subvariants,” the ministry said.

“The predominant circulating COVID-19 subvariants currently detected in Singapore are XBB, and its sub-lineages XBB.1.5 and XBB.1.9 that were first detected locally in late-December 2022 and mid-January 2023 respectively.”","SINGAPORE: The current increase in COVID-19 cases in Singapore is not causing a strain on healthcare capacity, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Mar 27) in response to CNA’s queries.

The virus can attack and destroy the placenta, a vascular organ that serves as a fetus’s lifeline, leading to asphyxiation and stillbirth, according to the study in the journal Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine.

“We have never seen this level of destruction from an infectious illness before. It rendered the placenta unfit to carry out its duties,” said Dr. David Schwartz, a perinatal pathologist in private practice in Atlanta, who led the study. “These fetuses and newborns died from asphyxiation due to lack of oxygen.”

“It’s almost the exact opposite of what we see in other infectious diseases like zika, rubella or syphilis,” he said. “It’s not the fetus that is being attacked and destroyed by the virus. It’s the placenta.”

In the study, Schwartz and his team examined 68 perinatal deaths in 12 countries. All 68 babies were either stillborn or died within seven days of being born. All had mothers who were unvaccinated and had been infected with the coronavirus while pregnant. Their study included examinations of all 68 placentas as well as 30 autopsies.

While no fetal abnormalities aside from asphyxiation stuck out, the placentas showed a trend, which the researchers are calling ""SARS-CoV-2 placentitis.""

It consists of three factors: A build up of a protein called fibrin, which causes clotting in the organ’s delicate vascular system; the death of cells in the protective cell layer of the placenta; and unusual inflammation in the placenta.

On average, more than three-quarters of the placenta was so severely damaged, the organ couldn’t deliver oxygen and nutrients to the growing baby. In some cases, more than 90 percent of the placenta was dead.

Fibrin deposition can occur in completely normal, uncomplicated pregnancies, said Dr. Kjersti Aagaard, a professor of maternal-fetal medicine at Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children’s Hospital who was not involved in the new study. “But what you don’t see is three-quarters of the placenta filled with these. No fetus can survive that.”

Mild Covid can still cause damage

Pregnant people are naturally more susceptible to infection because pregnancy weakens the immune system to keep a person’s body from attacking the fetus. What makes Covid infection different from other viral infections during pregnancy is how it infects the body and, in particular, how that infection lingers and restricts blood flow to the placenta.

“It causes this severe reaction deeper in the respiratory tree. Recovery has been slow and patients have had this continuous damage to their lungs they can’t recover from,” said Dr. Ellie Ragsdale, director of fetal intervention at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, who was not involved with the new study.

Full coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic

But Covid can cause serious problems even in women without severe disease, Ragsdale said. ""The thing that is the scariest about this is we are seeing this in women who have very mild symptoms from Covid. This damage to the placenta may be their only symptom.""

If only a small portion of the placenta is damaged, it may not cause any complications at all.

But if it’s a larger area, Ragsdale said, “the first thing you’ll see is growth restriction from the baby and decreased fetal movement. The final thing that you see is a pregnancy loss, and sometimes that progression happens very quickly.”

According to Schwartz, early research suggests SARS-CoV-2 placentitis happens over a period of days up to two weeks. Obstetricians are now being advised to perform third-trimester ultrasounds on women who have been infected with Covid during pregnancy to screen for warning signs that could endanger the baby.

“Obstetricians see placental insufficiencies happening in their practice all the time. You can never reverse it but you can contemplate delivery. If it’s medically feasible, you get the fetus out of there,” Schwartz said.

Aagaard stressed that stillbirth due to Covid is rare, but the infection does raise a woman’s risk.

A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study published in November found that stillbirths among mothers in the U.S. who had tested positive for Covid while pregnant increased nearly three-fold during the delta wave that started last July.

Around 0.59 percent of pregnancies resulted in stillbirths pre-pandemic. In the first part of the pandemic, 0.98 percent of pregnancies in expectant mothers infected with the coronavirus resulted in stillbirths. Once the delta variant took hold, the rate jumped to 2.7 percent of Covid-infected expectant mothers.

The importance of vaccination

Doctors say the “single best” way for pregnant women to protect themselves and their babies is to get the Covid vaccine.

“While there are a lot of things we don’t know how to prevent in pregnancy, including stillbirths unrelated to Covid-19, we can prevent Covid-19-related stillbirths with a vaccine,” Aagaard said.

The CDC, the American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists, and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine all strongly recommend that pregnant women be vaccinated against Covid.

Evidence demonstrating the safety of the vaccines to pregnant women and their babies continues to build. An Israeli study, published Thursday in JAMA Pediatrics, included more than 24,000 babies, and found no difference in the risk of preterm birth or low birth weight among mothers who were vaccinated or unvaccinated. In other words, the vaccine didn’t increase the risk of these outcomes in pregnant women. There were also no significant differences in the number of babies who were hospitalized in the first five months of life.

“These two studies side by side reinforce the notion that the single best decision that any pregnant person and their family can make at this moment in time is to get the Covid vaccine,” Aagaard said. “That is the best thing they can choose to do to improve the chance that they are going to have a healthy uncomplicated delivery.”

Jan 26 (Reuters) - Fox News Channel host Dan Bongino on Wednesday became among the most-followed conservative personalities to be permanently banned from YouTube, a week after the Google-owned (GOOGL.O) video service said he had posted COVID-19 misinformation.

YouTube suspended one of Bongino's YouTube channels on Jan. 20 after he posted a video where he questioned the effectiveness of using masks against the coronavirus, a violation of the company's pandemic-related misinformation policy. His later attempt to circumvent that one-week suspension by posting from another channel triggered a permanent ban, YouTube said.

""When a channel receives a strike, it is against our Terms of Service to post content or use another channel to circumvent the suspension,"" YouTube said in a statement. ""If a channel is terminated, the uploader is unable to use, own or create any other YouTube channels.""

The video giant has added more rules around COVID-19 content as the pandemic has worn on. Last September, it banned conservative commentators such as Joseph Mercola and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for spreading misinformation about vaccines.

Bongino did not respond to a request for comment sent to his website on Wednesday. But he said on Twitter last week that the suspension did not surprise him and that he planned to continue posting videos on Rumble, a YouTube-style service popular among conservatives. Bongino wrote that he had double the number of followers on Rumble as on YouTube.

His Dan Bongino Show channel on YouTube had 882,000 subscribers and nearly 1,100 uploads since it was created in 2013, according to tracker Social Blade.

234,234,https://www.clinicaltrialsarena.com/features/huntingtons-disease-endpoints/,Mapping Endpoints: Can Huntington’s disease clinical trial design tweaks lead to success?,"Need to know:

Following two late-phase Huntington’s disease trial misses, both Roche and Prilenia Therapeutics are using new clinical trial design approaches in a bid for positive study results. Prilenia, specifically, changed its primary endpoint in response to new information about its drug’s mechanism.

Overall, to maximise their success chances, late-stage Huntington’s disease trials should last more than one year, pursue biomarkers of disease activity, and target patients with early-stage disease.

Expected Phase II readouts from Annexon Biosciences and Wave Life Sciences round out this year’s crop of drug development data readouts for Huntington’s disease, which has no FDA-approved, disease-modifying therapy.

The past several years have seen a series of high-profile Huntington’s disease (HD) clinical trial misses. In March 2021, Roche reported that its Phase III study of tominersen had ended prematurely. During the same month, Wave Life Sciences announced two of its antisense oligonucleotide candidates did not have any anticipated effects on slowing HD disease progression. In February 2019, Prilenia Therapeutics revealed that pridopidine fell short of its primary outcome in a Phase II study.

By adjusting the primary endpoints and target patient populations, the HD candidates from Roche and Prilenia could be back on track with two new clinical trials. In addition, Annexon Biosciences’ ANX-005 and Wave’s third HD asset WVE-003 expect readouts this year for their safety-focused clinical trials.

Because HD is a neurodegenerative disease that slowly advances over decades, it can prove challenging to detect changes in disease progression during a relatively short-term clinical trial. The lack of validated biomarkers of disease state or progression, combined with uncertainty over mechanistic targets, only compounds this difficulty.

Still, there are strategies for maximising chances at success. Drug developers should target the early stage HD population, research potential biomarkers like striatal atrophy, and schedule trials for more than one year to satisfy regulators. This year’s upcoming HD drug trial readouts will shed light on whether these approaches could help the field bounce back from a series of failed attempts.

Huntington's disease requires long trials

Both European regulators and the FDA accept statistically significant improvement in the Unified Huntington’s Disease Rating Scale – Total Functional Capacity (UHDRS-TFC) as a single primary endpoint for an approval in HD, says Prilenia Therapeutics CEO Michael Hayden. The UHDRS-TFC measures how patients manage work, finances, daily living, domestic chores, and care arrangements.

To detect a slowing of HD progression via UDHRS-TFC, clinical trials should be 1.5–3 years long, notes Dr Christopher Ross, director of neurobiology at John Hopkins Medicine. Because UDHRS-TFC is just a 13-point scale, it is fairly insensitive to changes in HD disease progression, he adds. However, any statistically significant change along UHDRS-TFC is sure to be clinically relevant, he explains.

Prilenia has a Phase III trial underway in HD, using UHDRS-TFC over 65 weeks as the primary endpoint. Prilenia’s Hayden says the FDA recommended a trial length of at least 52 weeks, and European regulators asked the trial to go even longer.

Enrolment can prove lengthy in Huntington's disease

HD is tough to diagnose early and only affects approximately one in 10,000 people in the US, making clinical trial enrolment lengthy. In fact, according to GlobalData’s clinical trials database, Phase I to Phase III drug trials in HD between 2015 and 2020 averaged longer enrolment periods than treatment periods. The average Phase I trial had a 17.2-month enrolment period, while the average treatment period was 2.6 months.

However, Phase III trials average shorter enrolment periods than earlier stage studies. While the average enrolment time is 15.1 months in a Phase III study, the average treatment period is 12.7 months.

Nonetheless, people with HD are typically very enthusiastic to take part in clinical trials for the fatal disease, Ross notes. Overall, finding willing participants is not a significant issue, he adds.

Prilenia’s Phase III trial of pridopidine surpassed its enrollment goal of 480 patients and recruited six weeks ahead schedule, the company’s CEO Hayden says. The study has 58 sites throughout the US, Canada, and Europe.

Targeting early disease optimises trials

To maximise the chance of detecting changes via UHDRS-TFC, most HD trials should target patients in earlier stage HD, Hayden explains. UHDRS-TFC declines more rapidly in early stage HD, making it easier to detect change relative to placebo along the scale, he adds. Both Roche and Prilenia have placebo-controlled studies.

Overall, HD has five stages that typically progress over the course of 10 to 30 years from disease emergence. A UHDRS-TFC score of 11–13 means the patient has the least severe symptoms, while a score of 0 is the most severe. UHDRS-TFC typically lowers by around one point if the patient is in Stage I, by 0.8 in Stage 2, by 0.3 in Stage 3, and by 0.1 in Stage 4, Hayden explains.

Prilenia’s trial is recruiting Stage I or 2 patients, defined as a UHDRS-TFC score of 7 or higher at screening. Roche has not yet revealed its complete trial design details. It did not reply to a comment request.

Striatal atrophy, a hallmark of HD, can already arise 10–15 years before HD symptoms manifest, Ross notes. As such, HD may be too late to target by the time visible symptoms appear, he explains.

Biomarkers in development

The field is eager to begin trials even earlier, in the presymptomatic HD population. However, it is difficult to select an outcome measure for patients without diagnosable HD. Drug developers could attempt long trials aimed at delaying the onset of HD, but ideally the FDA would allow biomarkers or surrogate markers for disease progression, Ross says.

The FDA could eventually accept a marker like striatal atrophy, but the agency would need a successful HD trial to link this biomarker to actual improvement in UHDRS-TFC, Ross adds. The ongoing Phase III trial for pridopidine does not have the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) testing necessary to potentially measure striatal atrophies correlation with HD progression, he notes. There is currently no approved disease-modifying therapy in HD.

Neurofilament light chain (NfL), a biomarker that is also in development for the neurodegenerative disease ALS, could serve as a measure of HD disease onset if it gains more supporting evidence, Hayden notes. NfL is a blood biomarker that could be correlated with neurodegeneration in the central nervous system.

New endpoint for Prilenia’s pridopidine

Prilenia’s pridopidine has 499 patients enrolled in the Phase III PROOF-HD trial (NCT04556656), which tests UHDRS-TFC after 65 weeks as its primary endpoint. Results for the Phase III study, which has FDA fast track designation, are expected in early 2023. The drug has a 2027 sales forecast of $79m, according to GlobalData’s peak sales consensus estimates.

Before beginning the Phase III trial, pridopidine missed the primary endpoint in a 408-patient Phase II trial (NCT02006472). The Phase II used UHDRS – Total Motor Score (UHDRS-TMS) as its primary endpoint. Prilenia originally thought pridopidine could improve motor symptoms in HD by targeting dopamine receptors, Prelinia’s Hayden says. However, the company subsequently realised that pridopidine had potentially neuroprotective effects by targeting the sigma-1 receptor (S1R), which explains the change in endpoint in Phase III, he explains.

The current Phase III uses UHDRS-TFC instead of UHDRS-TMS because the former is better at detecting a slowing of disease progression, Hayden adds. As for the Phase III’s trial success prospects, Ross says there is a compelling biological case that pridopidine could have neuroprotective effects by targeting S1R. S1R is a ligand-operated protein situated in endoplasmic reticulum membranes, with its change in function and/or expression associated with various neurological disorders such as Huntington’s disease.

Roche to come back with new trial

As for Roche’s Phase III GENERATION HD1 trial (NCT03761849), the study halted early last year following a recommendation from an independent data monitoring committee. However, the development partners Roche and Ionis announced on January 18 that they are designing a Phase II trial of tominersen in HD.

Exploratory post-hoc tominersen analyses suggest that it may benefit younger adult patients with lower disease burden, a Roche spokesperson says. Roche and Ionis are currently in the early stages of designing a multiple-dose Phase II trial to test this new hypothesis, she adds. The company will share further details about the GENERATION HD1 data findings and design of the new Phase II at a future scientific meeting, she notes.

The 899-patient GENERATION HD1 study had coprimary endpoints of UHDRS-TFC and Composite UHDRS (cUHDRS), both over 101 weeks. GENERATION HD1 recruited patients ages 25 to 65 years with manifest HD, a term for patients whose symptoms are thought to result from HD. Tominersen has a peak sales forecast of $778m in 2027.

According to Ross, there are two possible explanations for why the Phase III trial failed. One possibility is that tominersen could be knocking down wild-type Huntington and damaging neurons because it is not allele-specific, he notes. This means that any nonallele selective Huntington-lowering agent would have the same problem, potentially eliminating the whole approach, he explains.

There could also be an inflammatory off-target effect, which is more likely the case, Ross says. In the interim analysis of GENERATION HD1, patients in the most frequent dosing group progressed in HD more rapidly than those in the placebo group.

Upcoming safety-driven trial data

As for the other readouts this year, Annexon’s ANX-005 has a 28-patient, open-label, Phase IIa trial (NCT04514367) with results expected in Q2. Wave’s WVE-003 is recruiting for a 36-patient Phase I/IIa trial (NCT05032196), with results also expected this year.

ANX-005 is a complement C1q subcomponent inhibitor. “The theory behind the Annexon compound is that there’s abnormal synaptic pruning during HD, which could be blocked by [Annexon’s] complement inhibitor,” Ross explains. “That’s an enticing idea, and it could potentially target an earlier stage of the disease.” However, synaptic pruning could be a necessary component of memory and learning, so there could be problems with altering it, he adds. Annexon’s ANX-005 has a peak sales estimate of $252m.

WVE-003 targets the Huntington protein (HTT) to slow disease progression. The trial is enrolling patients with early manifest HD who carry single nucleotide polymorphism 3 (SNP3). Although Wave’s previous two HD assets were associated with serious side effects, this third compound has not yet exhibited any serious adverse events (AEs), Ross says. Previous trials show serious AEs included disorientation, delirium, ataxia, and slurred speech.

AE with previous Wave candidates may imply that such issues were related to the chemical backbone rather than the target itself, Ross explains. A Wave spokesperson notes WVE-003 has a different sequence and design compared with the company’s first-generation HD candidates, including the incorporation of phosphoryl guanidine-based backbone chemistry modifications.

Wave's ongoing HD trial is designed differently from its previous two HD trials, the spokesperson adds. The ongoing Phase I/IIa has dose escalation and dosing frequency guided by an independent committee to support data driven decisions regarding dosing, and to potentially accelerate time to proof-of-concept, she notes.

Progress in easing HD symptoms

While the road to developing disease modifying therapies in HD has proven tough, there has been headway in treating HD’s common symptom of chorea. Chorea is a movement disorder characterised by involuntary and unpredictable muscle movement. In December 2021, Neurocrine Biosciences announced that Ingrezza (valbenazine) met its primary endpoint of UHDRS – Total Maximal Chorea (UHDRS-TMC) in the Phase III KINECT-HD trial (NCT04102579).

Ingrezza is likely to gain approval because the data on chorea is strong and the mechanism is clear, Hayden says. Depleting presynaptic dopamine has an impact on chorea, although it has no effect on function or disease progression, he notes. Ingrezza, which is a vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) inhibitor, already has an FDA approval for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia.

If Ingrezza does gain a regulatory nod in HD, the drug would join Lundbeck’s Xenazine (tetrabenazine) and Teva Pharmaceutical’s Austedo (deutetrabenazine) as FDA-approved drugs for treating chorea. They are also the only approved drugs for HD overall. In the meantime, the quest for a disease-modifying treatment continues.

Takeaways:

Prilenia is using UHDRS-TFC as the primary endpoint in its Phase III study after evidence from a Phase II trial suggested that pridopidine has neuroprotective effects. The Phase II trial failed but used a different endpoint.

Roche plans to continue testing tominersen in a Phase II trial in younger, early stage HD patients based on a post hoc analyses from a Phase III trial that was terminated early. Full trial design is not yet revealed.

Annexon’s ANX-005 and Wave’s WVE-003 are in early stages of development, with companies amid safety-focused Phase II trials.

“The confirmation of these new cases is a critical signal to scale up response efforts to quickly stop the chain of transmission,” WHO Africa Director Matshidiso Moeti said in the statement.

Marburg virus disease is a viral hemorrhagic fever that can have a fatality rate of up to 88%, according to the WHO.

Symptoms include fever, fatigue and blood-stained vomit and diarrhea. There are no vaccines or antiviral treatments approved to treat it.

Neighboring Cameroon also detected two suspected cases of Marburg disease last month despite restricting movement along the border to avoid contagion.

The latest, published in mBio, finds that e-cigarette users have a unique oral microbiome—the community of bacteria and other microorganisms—that is less healthy than nonsmokers but potentially healthier than cigarette smokers and measures worsening gum disease over time.

“To our knowledge, this is the first longitudinal study of oral health and e-cigarette use. We are now beginning to understand how e-cigarettes and the chemicals they contain are changing the oral microbiome and disrupting the balance of bacteria,” said Deepak Saxena, who led the research with Xin Li; both are professors of molecular pathobiology at NYU College of Dentistry.

Gum disease affects nearly half of U.S. adults over 30 years of age. Smoking cigarettes is a known risk factor for developing gum disease, but less is known about the impact of e-cigarettes—which vaporize nicotine and other chemicals—on oral health, especially the long-term consequences of vaping.

The researchers studied the oral health of 84 adults from three groups: cigarette smokers, e-cigarette users, and people who have never smoked. Gum disease was assessed through two dental exams six months apart, during which plaque samples were taken to analyze the bacteria present.

Changes to gum health

All participants had some gum disease at the start of the study, with cigarette smokers having the most severe disease, followed by e-cigarette users. After six months, the researchers observed that gum disease had worsened in some participants in each group, including several e-cigarette users.

A key indicator of gum disease is clinical attachment loss, measured by gum ligament and tissue separating from a tooth’s surface, leading the gum to recede and form pockets. These pockets are breeding grounds for bacteria and can lead to more severe gum disease. In a study of the same participants published in Frontiers in Oral Health, the research team found that clinical attachment loss was significantly worse only in the e-cigarette smokers—not nonsmokers and cigarette smokers—after six months.

The researchers analyzed the bacteria found in the plaque samples and determined that e-cigarette users have a different oral microbiome from smokers and nonsmokers—building on findings the team previously reported in iScience and Molecular Oral Microbiology.

While all groups shared roughly a fifth of the types of bacteria, the bacterial makeup for e-cigarette users had strikingly more in common with cigarette smokers than nonsmokers. Several types of bacteria, including Selenomonas, Leptotrichia, and Saccharibacteria, were abundant in both smokers and vapers compared to nonsmokers. Several other bacteria—including Fusobacterium and Bacteroidales, which are known to be associated with gum disease—were particularly dominant in the mouths of e-cigarette users.

When plaque samples were gathered and analyzed in the six-month follow-up, the researchers found greater diversity in bacteria for all groups studied, yet each group maintained its own distinct microbiome.

“Vaping appears to be driving unique patterns in bacteria and influencing the growth of some bacteria in a manner akin to cigarette smoking, but with its own profile and risks to oral health,” said Fangxi Xu, a junior research scientist in Saxena’s lab and the study’s co-first author.

An altered immune response

The researchers found that the distinct microbiome in e-cigarette users was correlated with clinical measures of gum disease and changes to the host immune environment. In particular, vaping was associated with different levels of cytokines—proteins that help regulate the immune system. Certain cytokines are linked to an imbalance in oral bacteria and can worsen gum disease by making people prone to inflammation and infection.

TNFα, a cytokine that causes inflammation, was significantly elevated among e-cigarette users. In contrast, cytokines IL-4 and IL-1β were lower among e-cigarette users; IL-4 tends to be reduced in people with gum disease and increases after treatment, which suggests that certain bacteria in the mouths of e-cigarette users may be actively suppressing immune responses.

The researchers concluded that the distinct oral microbiome of e-cigarette users elicits altered immune responses, which along with clinical markers for gum disease illustrate how vaping presents its own challenge to oral health.

“E-cigarette use is a relatively new human habit,” said Scott Thomas, an assistant research scientist in Saxena’s lab and the study’s co-first author. “Unlike smoking, which has been studied extensively for decades, we know little about the health consequences of e-cigarette use and are just starting to understand how the unique microbiome promoted by vaping impacts oral health and disease.”

This research was supported by the National Institute of Dental & Craniofacial Research (DE025992, DE027074), the National Cancer Institute (CA206105), and the NYU Mega-Grants Initiative. The study included additional collaborators from NYU College of Dentistry, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, and the University of Pennsylvania.

Changes to gum healthAll participants had some gum disease at the start of the study, with cigarette smokers having the most severe disease, followed by e-cigarette users.
After six months, the researchers observed that gum disease had worsened in some participants in each group, including several e-cigarette users.
A key indicator of gum disease is clinical attachment loss, measured by gum ligament and tissue separating from a tooth’s surface, leading the gum to recede and form pockets.

ILD develops in approximately 10% of patients with RA, with risk factors including smoking, rheumatoid factor or anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide autoantibodies, and certain genetic variants.2

“Clinicians must determine the best therapy to control a patient’s joint disease, while at the same time minimize the potential risk of pulmonary toxic effects in these patients with already compromised lung function,” wrote Matthew C Baker, MD, MS, Clinical Chief in the Division of Immunology and Rheumatology at Stanford University, and a team of investigators. “Current data are lacking regarding the risk of bDMARD and targeted synthetic DMARD (tsDMARD) use on the development of ILD in patients with RA.”

A retrospective cohort study using claims data from the Optum Clinformatics Data Mart between December 2003 and December 2019 was conducted to analyze the risk of developing ILD in adult patients with RA receiving treatment with different bDMARDs or tsDMARDs.

The primary endpoint was incident ILD. The incidence rates (IRs) for the development of ILD were analyzed and the risk of ILD for specific b/tsDMARDs was compared using Cox-regression models.

Tofacitinib was linked to a reduced risk of developing ILD when compared with adalimumab in the primary analysis. However, the drug is usually prescribed as a third-line agent after adalimumab, which may cause inherent biases. Therefore, a sensitivity analysis compared these treatments using a prevalent new-user cohort design.

Eligible patients were adults with RA with 1 year or more of continuous enrollment treated with a b/tsDMARD of interest without a preexisting ILD diagnosis. DMARDs included tofacitinib, tocilizumab, rituximab, adalimumab, and abatacept.

In total, 28,559 patients with RA were included in the analysis. The mean age was 55.6 years and 78% (n=22,158) were female. Of these patients, 13,326 were treated with adalimumab, 5676 received abatacept, 5444 were in the rituximab group, 2548 were in the tocilizumab cohort, and 1565 were treated with tofacitinib.

A total of 276 incident cases of ILD developed during the follow-up period. Compared with other bDMARDs, patients treated with tofacitinib had a 4-fold reduced incidence of ILD. The crude IRs per 1000 person-years for ILD were reported as 6.15 (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.76-7.84) for rituximab, 5.05 (95% CI 3.47-7.12) for tocilizumab, 4.46 (95% CI 3.44-5.70) for abatacept, 3.43 (95% CI 2.85-4.09) for adalimumab, and only 1.47 (95% CI 0.54-3.27) for tofacitinib.

An adjusted model showed a 69% reduced risk of ILD in the tofacitinib group compared with adalimumab-treated patients (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.31; 95% CI 0.12 – 0.78; P = .009). Further, after propensity score matching in the prevalent new-user cohort design, analysis reported that the incidence rate per 1000 person-years of ILD for patients receiving tofacitinib was 1.48 (95% CI, 0.54 – 3.28), compared with 4.30 (95% CI, 3.15 – 5.74) in the adalimumab group.

In the adjusted model, patients treated with tofacitinib had a 68% reduced risk of developing ILD when compared with the adalimumab cohort (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.32; 95% CI 0.13 – 0.82; P <.001).

“Additional prospective studies are needed to better understand the role tofacitinib may play in preventing ILD in patients with RA,” investigators concluded. “These results, while significant, should be interpreted with caution given the fairly small sample size of the tofacitinib group.”

The sobering request, reported exclusively by Reuters, suggests that the health organisation fears that a deadly pathogen could be released via Russian bombardment of laboratories.

WHO offered help to Ukraine on laboratory practices

Laboratories containing research on public health require delicate handling of disease-causing microorganisms. Scientists who are employed in similar places follow a rigorous protocol to ensure that they don’t carry a pandemic-causing microorganism out into the world.

The WHO monitors global efforts that could risk a containment spill, as part of the organisation’s official work. The organisation ran a four-day workshop in support of lab reforms alongside health-care reforms, ongoing at the time in Ukraine.

In a 2018 progress report, the WHO noted that seven public health laboratories in Ukraine had been assessed. Among them, three laboratories in Donetsk, Lugansk and Mariupol.

Speaking to Reuters via email, the WHO said: “As part of this work, WHO has strongly recommended to the Ministry of Health in Ukraine and other responsible bodies to destroy high-threat pathogens to prevent any potential spills.”

What is a deadly pathogen?

According to research in BMC Biology, a pathogen is “usually defined as a microorganism that causes, or can cause, disease. We have defined a pathogen as a microbe that can cause damage in a host.”

There appears to be some debate about defining lines, with the same authors writing that there were no inherent differences between pathogenic and non-pathogenic microorganisms. Essentially, the scientists say that a non-pathogen can become disease-causing – in the body of a host or in a laboratory.

They further said: “The same microbe could exist in pathogenic and non-pathogenic states.”

Ukraine braces for polio outbreak alongside war

COVID is wrecking public health damage across the globe, including among the Ukrainian population – with only 34.5% of the population double-jabbed against the life-threatening virus.

Outbreaks could significantly compromise the mortality of an already vulnerable population, which is experiencing a polio outbreak. 140,000 children were due to be vaccinated against polio, a spinal-cord impacting virus, but the vaccination campaign is on hold due to Russian violence.

Reflecting on the disruption, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) commented: “Surveillance to detect and report new cases of polio is also disrupted, increasing the risk of undetected spread of the disease among vulnerable populations. The GPEI is working to urgently develop contingency plans to support Ukraine and prevent further spread of polio.”

“Surveillance to detect and report new cases of polio is also disrupted”

The WHO did not confirm if these instructions were followed in time, or the exact nature of the pathogens involved. However, there was no factual assessment of any biowarfare weapons – these laboratories are focused on health research.

Cutting through the foliage isn't easy, but such discoveries are becoming more common thanks to a combination of two technologies: lasers that can ""see through"" obstructions and drones that help archaeologists explore places humans sometimes can't easily reach.

Around a dozen small structures were identified less than 5 miles from the main remnants of the 15th century Inca city, on the outskirts of a ceremonial site called Chachabamba, according to a study published in the January edition of the Journal of Archaeological Science.

The scientists used a type of remote-sensing technology known as light detection and ranging, or lidar, which bounces laser pulses off surfaces to detect features and map their contours.

Lidar scanning, a relatively new tool in archaeology, is becoming an essential way for scientists to study areas that were once too dangerous or inaccessible. In 2019, laser scanning revealed a huge network of ancient Mayan farms in a rainforest in Belize. Years before that, lidar helped archaeologists uncover a lost city in Honduras.

The Machu Picchu discoveries, which include parts of a water system that ran through the area, are yielding new insights into Inca civilization and the role of ceremonial complexes at Machu Picchu.

""Only very privileged people could get to Machu Picchu, because it was a very special place,"" said Dominika Sieczkowska, the deputy director for organization and development at the University of Warsaw's Center for Andean Studies, who led the research. ""When you were going there, you had to stop in Chachabamba for a spiritual bath to be clean and pure to get to Machu Picchu.""

Chachabamba, which sits in the Vilcanota Valley, centers on a main stone altar surrounded by 14 baths, which Sieczkowska said most likely were used for ritual ablutions. Water to the site flowed through a complex network of channels fed by the Urubamba River.

The site is tricky to study, because the area is mostly overgrown, with archaeological ruins receding deep into the jungle. To uncover what lay beneath the forest canopy, Sieczkowska and scientists at the Wroclaw University of Science and Technology in Poland and Peru’s Ministry of Culture used drones outfitted with special lasers to pierce the foliage.

The lidar scans revealed about 12 structures all within about 60 feet of the main ceremonial part of Chachabamba.

""They were so close, and we didn't even know they were there,"" Sieczkowska said.

The laser scans also revealed stone channels running partly underground that supplied water throughout the Chachabamba site. The researchers then developed models based on the slope and depth of the canals to re-create how water may have flowed to the various ritual baths.

Sieczkowska said that much remains unknown about how the newfound structures around Chachabamba were used but that they may have been residences for people who oversaw the ceremonial site.

The archaeologists plan to conduct further research at Chachabamba, including excavations of interesting features that were identified in the lidar scans.

""The idea was to excavate some of the structures, but because of the pandemic, we had to cancel our plans for now,"" Sieczkowska said. ""But maybe, maybe, we'll get there next year.""","Hidden deep in the Peruvian jungle and shrouded beneath thick foliage, archaeologists have discovered a series of long-forgotten structures among the sprawling ruins of Machu Picchu.

It originally means “the destruction of a nation or an ethnic group”.

In 1946, United Nations (UN) General Assembly affirmed genocide as a crime under international law in Resolution 96, which stated that “Genocide is a denial of the right of existence of entire human groups, as homicide is the denial of the right to live of individual human beings; such denial of the right of existence shocks the conscience of mankind … and is contrary to moral law and the spirit and aims of the United Nations.”

On December 9, 1948, the UN General Assembly adopted Resolution 260A, or the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, which entered into force on January 12, 1951. The Resolution noted that “at all periods of history genocide has inflicted great losses on humanity”. Article II of the Convention clearly defines genocide as any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such: (a) Killing members of the group; (b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; (c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; (d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; (e) Forcibly transferring children of the groups to another group. The United States ratified the Convention in 1988.

Genocide is also clearly defined in U.S. domestic law. The United States Code, in Section 1091 of Title 18, defines genocide as violent attacks with the specific intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group, a definition similar to the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.

According to historical records and media reports, since its founding, the United States has systematically deprived Indians of their rights to life and basic political, economic, and cultural rights through killings, displacements, and forced assimilation, in an attempt to physically and culturally eradicate this group. Even today, Indians still face a serious existential crisis.

According to international law and its domestic law, what the United States did to the Indians covers all the acts that define genocide and indisputably constitutes genocide. The American magazine Foreign Policy commented that the crimes against Native Americans are fully consistent with the definition of genocide under current international law.

The profound sin of genocide is a historical stain that the United States can never clear, and the painful tragedy of Indians is a historical lesson that should never be forgotten.

I. Evidence on U.S. government’s genocide against Indians

1. Government-led action

On July 4, 1776, the United States of America was founded with the Declaration of Independence, which openly stated that “He (the British King) has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages”, and slandered Native Americans as “the merciless Indian Savages”.

The U.S. government and leaders treated Native Americans with a belief in white superiority and supremacy, set out to annihilate the Indians and attempted to eradicate the race through “cultural genocide”.

During the American War of Independence (1775-1783), the Second War of Independence (1812-1815) and the Civil War (1861-1865), the U.S. leaders, eager to transform its plantation economy as an adjunct to European colonialism and to expand their territories, coveted the vast Indian lands and launched thousands of attacks on Indian tribes, slaughtering Indian chiefs, soldiers and even civilians, and taking Indian lands for themselves.

In 1862, the United States enacted the Homestead Act, which provided that every American citizen above the age of 21, with a mere registration fee of 10 U.S. dollars, could acquire no more than 160 acres (about 64.75 hectares) of land in the west. Lured by the land, the white people swarmed into the Indian areas and started a massacre that resulted in the death of thousands of Indians.

Leaders of the U.S. government at that time openly claimed that the skin of Indians could be peeled off to make tall boots,that Indians must be annihilated or driven to places that no one would go, that Indians had to be wiped out swiftly, and that only dead Indians are good Indians. American soldiers saw the slaughter of Indians as natural, even an honor, and would not rest until they were all killed. Similar hate rhetoric and atrocities abound, and are well documented in many Native American extermination monographs.

2. Bloody massacres and atrocities

Since the colonists set foot in North America, they had systematically and extensively hunted American bison, cutting off the source of food and basic livelihood of the Indians, and causing their death from starvation in large numbers.

Statistics reveal that since its independence in 1776, the U.S. government has launched over 1,500 attacks on Indian tribes, slaughtering the Indians, taking their lands, and committing countless crimes. In 1814, the U.S. government decreed that it would award 50 to 100 dollars for each Indian skull surrendered. The American Historian Frederick Turner acknowledged in The Significance of the Frontier in American History, released in 1893, that each frontier was won by a series of wars against the Indians.

The California Gold Rush also brought about the California Massacre. Peter Burnett, the first governor of California, proposed a war of extermination against Native Americans, triggering rising calls for the extermination of Indians in the state. In California in the 1850s and 60s, an Indian skull or scalp was worth 5 dollars, while the average daily wage was 25 cents. From 1846 to 1873, the Indian population in California dropped to 30,000 from 150,000. Countless Indians died as a result of the atrocities. Some of the major massacres include:

◆In 1811, American troops defeated the famous Indian chief Tecumseh and his army in the Battle of Tippecanoe, burned the Indian capital Prophetstown and committed brutal massacres.

◆From November 1813 to January 1814, the U.S. Army launched the Creek War against the Native Americans, also known as the Battle of Horseshoe Bend. On March 27, 1814, about 3,000 soldiers attacked the Creek Indians at Horseshoe Bend, Mississippi Territory. Over 800 Creek warriors were slaughtered in the fight, and as a result, the military strength of the Creeks was significantly weakened. Under the Treaty of Fort Jackson signed on August 9 of the same year, the Creeks ceded more than 23 million acres of land to the U.S. federal government.

◆On November 29, 1864, pastor John Chivington massacred Indians at Sand Creek in southeastern Colorado, due to the opposition of a few Indians to the signing of a land grant agreement. It was one of the most notorious massacres of Native Americans. Maria Montoya, a professor of history at New York University, said in an interview that Chivington’s soldiers scalped women and children, beheaded them, and paraded them through the streets upon their return to Denver.

James Anaya, former UN special rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples,submitted his report after a country visit to the United States in 2012. According to the accounts of the descendants of the victims of the Sand Creek Massacre, in 1864, around 700 armed U.S. soldiers raided and shot at Cheyenne and Arapaho people living on the Sand Creek Indian Reservation in Colorado. Media reports showed that the massacre resulted in the deaths of between 70 and 163 among the 200-plus tribal members. Two-thirds of the dead were women or children, and no one was held responsible for the massacre. The U.S. government had reached a compensation agreement with tribal descendants, which has not been delivered even to this day.

◆On December 29, 1890, near the Wounded Knee Creek in South Dakota, U.S. troops fired at the Indians, killing and injuring more than 350 people according to the U.S. Congressional Record. After the Wounded Knee Massacre, armed Indian resistance was largely suppressed. About 20 U.S. soldiers were awarded the Medal of Honor.

◆In 1930, the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs began sterilizing Indian women through the Indian Health Service program. Sterilization was conducted in the name of protecting the health of Indian women, and in some cases, even performed without the women’s knowledge. Statistics suggest that in early 1970s, more than 42% of Indian women of childbearing age were sterilized. This resulted in the near extinction for many small tribes. By 1976, approximately 70,000 Indian women had been forcibly sterilized.

3. Westward expansion and forced migration

In its early days, the United States regarded Indian tribes as sovereign entities and dealt with them on land, trade, justice and other issues largely through negotiated treaties, and occasionally through war. By 1840, the United States had concluded more than 200 treaties with various tribes, most of which were unequal treaties that were reached under U.S. military and political pressure and through deception and coercion, and were binding on the Indian tribes only. The treaties were used as a primary tool to take advantage of Indian tribes.

In 1830, the United States passed the Indian Removal Act, which marked the institutionalization of forced relocation of Indians in the country. The Act legally deprived Indian tribes of the right to live in the eastern United States, forcing some 100,000 Indians to move to the west of the Mississippi River from their ancestral lands in the south. The migration began in the summer heat and continued through the winter with subzero temperatures. Trudging 16 miles each day, thousands died along the way as a result of hunger, cold, exhaustion, or disease and plague. The Indian population was decimated, and the forced migration became a “Trail of Blood and Tears”. Tribes that refused to move were left to military suppression, forcible eviction and even massacre by the U.S. government.

In 1839, before Texas joined the United States, the government demanded that Indians remove immediately or face the entire destruction of their possessions and the extermination of their tribe. Large numbers of Cherokees who refused to comply were shot and killed.

In 1863, the U.S. military carried out a “scorched earth” policy to forcibly remove the Navajo tribe, burning houses and crops, slaughtering livestock and vandalizing properties. Under the Army’s watch, Navajos had to walk several hundred kilometers to a reservation in eastern New Mexico. Pregnant women and seniors who fell behind were shot on the spot.

In the mid-19th century, nearly all American Indians were driven to the west of the Mississippi River, and forced by the U.S. government to live in Native American reservations.

As was written in the Cambridge Economic History of the United States, as a result of the U.S. government’s forcible expulsion of the last Indians in the east, only a very small number of Indians who were individual citizens of the nation, or those individual Indians who went into hiding during the forceful expulsion, remained in the region.

Sadly, to whitewash this part of history, U.S. historians often glorify the Westward Expansion as the American people’s pursuit of economic development in the western frontier, claiming that it accelerated the improvement of American democracy, boosted economic prosperity, and contributed to the formation and development of the American national spirit. They make no mention of the brutal massacre of Native Americans.

In fact, it was after the Westward Expansion that the budding civilization of the Americas was destroyed, and the Indians, as one of the several major human races, faced complete extinction.

4. Forced assimilation and cultural extinction

To defend the unjust deeds of the U.S. government, some American scholars in the 19th century trumpeted the dichotomy of “civilization versus barbarism” and portrayed Native Americans as a savage, evil, and inferior group. Francis Parkman, a famous 19th-century American historian, even claimed that the American Indian “will not learn the arts of civilization, and he and his forest must perish together.”

George Bancroft, Parkman’s contemporary and another well-known American historian, also claimed that compared with the white people, Native Americans were “inferior in reason and moral qualities”, adding that “nor is this inferiority simply attached to the individual; it is connected with organization, and is the characteristic of the race.” Such an attempt to justify colonial plundering by demeaning Indians is nothing but racially discriminative.

In the 1870s and ’80s, the U.S. government adopted a more aggressive policy of “forced assimilation” to obliterate the social fabric and culture of Indian tribes. The core objective of the strategy was to destroy the original group affiliation as well as the ethnic and tribal identity of the Indians, and transform them into individual Americans with American citizenship, civic consciousness and identification with mainstream American values. Four measures were taken to this end.

First, fully depriving Indian tribes of their right to self-governance. American Indians had lived in tribal units over the years, and tribes had been their source of strength and spiritual support. The U.S. government forcibly abolished the tribal system and cast individual Indians into a white society with completely different traditions. Unable to find a job or make a living, the Indians became economically destitute, politically deprived and socially discriminated against. They experienced great mental pain and a deep existential and cultural crisis. In the 19th century, the thriving Cherokee tribes enjoyed a material life almost comparable to that of frontier whites. Nevertheless, with their right to self-governance and their tribal system gradually abolished by the U.S. government, the Cherokee community quickly declined and became the poorest group among the indigenous people.

Second, trying to destroy Indian reservations through land distribution and ultimately disintegrate their tribes. The Dawes Act passed in 1887 authorized the U.S. president to dissolve Indian reservations, abolish the tribal land ownership in the original reservations, and allocate land directly to Indians living inside and outside the reservations, forming a de facto land privatization system. The abolition of tribal land ownership disintegrated the American Indian communities, and seriously undermined tribal authority. As the highest form of tribal unity, the traditional ritual “Sun Dance” was regarded as “heresy” and thus banned. Most of the land in the original reservations was transferred to the white people through auction; the Indians who were less prepared for farming lost their newly acquired land as a result of swindling among other reasons, and their lives deteriorated by the day.

Third, taking steps to fully impose American citizenship on the Indians. Native Americans who were identified as mixed-race had to give up their tribal status, and others were “de-tribalized”, which greatly damaged the Indian identity.

Fourth, eradicating the Indians’ sense of community and tribal identity by adopting measures on education, language, culture and religion and a series of social policies. Beginning with the Civilization Fund Act of 1819, the United States established or funded boarding schools across the country and forced Indian children to attend. According to a report by the National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition, there have been altogether 367 boarding schools throughout the United States. By 1925, 60,889 Indian children had been forced to attend boarding schools. In 1926, 83% of Indian children were enrolled. The total number of students enrolled still remains unclear to this day. Guided by the idea of “Kill the Indian, Save the Man”, the United States banned Indian children from speaking their native language, wearing their traditional clothes, or carrying out traditional activities, thus erasing their language, culture and identity in an act of cultural genocide. Indian children suffered immensely at school, and some died from starvation, disease and abuse. This was followed by a policy of “forced foster care” — children were forcibly placed in the care of whites, which was a continuation of the assimilation policy and denial of cultural identity. These practices were not banned until 1978, when the Indian Child Welfare Act was passed. In passing the Act, it was acknowledged in the Congress that a large number of Indian children had been removed to non-Indian families and institutions without permission, resulting in the breakup of Indian families.

As renowned historians said,with the forced assimilation, one of the most despicable things in American history reached its peak. This was perhaps the most unfortunate chapter for Indians.

II. American Indians remain in serious survival and development crisis

The U.S. government’s genocide of Indians has led to a precipitous drop in the population of Indian communities, deterioration of their living conditions, lack of social security, low economic status, threats to their safety, and plummeted political influence.

1. Sharp decline of population

Before the arrival of white settlers in 1492, there were 5 million Indians, yet by 1800 the number plummeted to 600,000. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the number of Native Americans in 1900 was only 237,000, the lowest in history. Among them, more than a dozen tribes, such as the Pequot, Mohegan, and Massachusetts, were completely extinct.

Between 1800 and 1900, the American Indians lost more than half of their population, and their proportion in the total U.S. population dropped from 10.15% to 0.31%. Throughout the 19th century, while the U.S. population grew by 20-30% every 10 years, the Indian population experienced a precipitous decline. Currently, the Indian and Alaska Native population accounts for only 1.3% of the total U.S. population.

2. Deteriorating living conditions

Indians were pushed from the east to the barren west, and most of the Indian reservations were located in remote areas unfit for agriculture, much less for investment in industrial development. Most of the tribes, with scattered reservations of varying sizes, were unable to obtain adequate land for development and were therefore subject to severe development restraints.

There are currently about 310 Native American reservations in the United States, accounting for about 2.3% of the U.S. territory, and not all federally recognized tribes have their own reservations. These reservations are mostly located in remote and barren areas with poor living conditions and inadequate access to water and other vital resources, where 60% of the road system are dirt or gravel roads. On the surface, Indians are no longer the subject of “extermination”, but just “forgotten”, “invisible” and “discriminated against”; yet in reality, they are simply left there for self-extermination.

The U.S. government has also systematically used Indian reservations as toxic or nuclear waste dumps through the means of deception and coercion, subjecting them to long-term exposure to uranium and other radioactive materials. As a result, the cancer incidence and fatality rates in the communities concerned is significantly higher than in other parts of the country. Indian communities have effectively become the “garbage cans” in the development process of the United States.

For instance, in the Navajo Nation reservation, the largest Indian tribe in the United States，about a quarter of women and some infants have large amounts of radioactive substances in their bodies. During the 40-plus years prior to 2009, the U.S. government had reportedly conducted a total of 928 nuclear tests in the area inhabited by the Shoshone tribe of American Indians, producing approximately 620,000 tons of radioactive fallout, nearly 48 times the amount of radioactive fallout from the 1945 atomic bombing in Hiroshima, Japan.

3. Lack of social security

According to a report released by the Indian Health Service, life expectancy of American Indians is 5.5 years lower than that of average Americans, and the incidence of diabetes, chronic liver disease and alcohol addiction are 3.2 times, 4.6 times and 6.6 times as much as the U.S. average respectively. Academic studies show that among all ethnic groups in the United States, Indians have the shortest life expectancy and the highest infant mortality rate; the incidence of drug and alcohol abuse among Indian adolescents is 13.3 times and 1.4 times higher than the national average, and the suicide rate 1.9 times that of the national average. These phenomena are closely related to insufficient government investment of public health resources, underlying health inequities, and the overall underdevelopment of minority communities.

The U.S. government provides limited educational and medical assistance to Indians. 99% of such assistance has gone to reservation residents, but 70% of the Indians live in cities and therefore cannot be covered. Apart from the Indian Health Service, many Indians have no access to health insurance and are often subject to discrimination and language barriers in non-Indian health services and non-tribal health facilities.

The underprivileged status of Indians in health care was further exposed amid the COVID-19 pandemic. U.S. CDC statistics show that as of August 18, 2020, the COVID-19 incidence and case-fatality rates among Indians were 2.8 times and 1.4 times, respectively, that of white Americans. A report produced by the UN Special Rapporteur on the right to adequate housing, pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 43/14, points out that Native Americans and African Americans are disproportionately affected by COVID-19, with a hospitalization rate five times that of non-Hispanic white Americans. The COVID-19 infection rate in Navajo Nation, the largest Indian reservation in the United States, even surpassed that of New York at one point, reaching the highest in the country.

In terms of education, the conditions of Indian reservations are much poorer than those of white American communities. According to the 2013-2017 statistics of the U.S. Census Bureau, only 14.3% of American Indians held a bachelor’s degree or higher, in contrast to 15.2% for Hispanics, 20.6% for African Americans and 34.5% for white Americans. Many Indian reservations are struggling with dilapidated schools and shattered education systems.

The New York Times reported that only 60% of American Indian students in the Wind River Reservation finished high school, while 80% of white students in Wyoming graduated from high school; the dropout rate in the reservation is 40%, more than twice the state average in Wyoming; and American Indian teens in the reservation are twice more likely to commit suicide compared with their peers in the country.

4. Poor economic and security conditions

Many reservations in the barren land of the Midwest have been grappling with economic stagnation and become the poorest areas in the country. The poverty rate of some reservations has even surpassed 85%. According to statistics of the U.S. Census Bureau in 2018, the poverty rate of American Indians, at 25.4%, was the highest among all ethnic minorities, compared with 20.8% for African Americans, 17.6% for Hispanics, and 8.1% for white Americans. The median income of American Indian families was only 60% that of white families.

In a visit to the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota, The Atlantic revealed that the local unemployment rate was as high as 80%. Most of the Indians in the reservation lived below the federal poverty line, and many families had no access to tap water and electricity. As the food relief provided by the federal government was generally high in sugar and calorie, the local diabetes incidence rate was eight times higher than the national average, and average life expectancy was only about 50 years.

Poor economic conditions have led to serious law-and-order issues. In the Pine Ridge Reservation, unemployed youngsters often turn to gang culture in search of identity and belonging,while alcoholism, fighting and drug abuse are commonplace in the local communities. According to a research by the U.S. National Institute of Justice, more than 1.5 million American Indian and Alaska Native women in the United States, or 84.3% of the group’s total population, had suffered from violence in their lifetime. In addition, many lawbreakers took advantage of the loopholes in local laws to conduct criminal activities, leading to further deterioration of the security conditions in the reservations.

5. Disadvantaged political status

In mainstream American politics, the Indians and other Native Americans are not choosing to be “silent”. Rather, they have been “silenced” by the system and “systematically erased”. American Indians have a relatively small population and do not have a strong interest in politics. With a lower turnout rate in elections than that of other ethnic groups, their interests and demands are often ignored by politicians. As a result, American Indians have been reduced to second-class citizens in the United States, and they are often called the “invisible minority” or the “vanishing race” in the country. It was not until 1924 that the American Indians were conditionally granted U.S. citizenship and not until 1965 that they were given the right to vote.

In June 2020, the Native American Rights Fund and other institutions conducted a study on the barriers to political participation faced by Native American voters, with the participation of civil societies, legal experts, and scholars from around the country. The results showed that only 66% of the 4.7 million eligible Native American voters were registered, and more than 1.5 million eligible Native American voters could not meaningfully exercise their right to vote due to political barriers. According to the results, Native American voters face 11 pervasive obstacles to political participation, including limited hours of government offices, lack of funding for elections, and discrimination. In the current U.S. Congress, only four members are American Indians, accounting for about 0.74% of the members of Congress in both houses. The political engagement and influence of the Native Americans are disproportionately lower than other groups of the American population.

Native American communities have long suffered neglect and discrimination. Many U.S. government statistical programs either leave them aside completely or simply classify them as “others”. Shannon Keller O’Loughlin, Chief Executive and Attorney of the Association on American Indian Affairs, said that the greatest aspiration of Native Americans is to attain social recognition. Native Americans have diverse cultures and languages, but are often seen not as an ethnic group, but as a political stratum with limited autonomy based on treaties with the federal government. The Brookings Institution recently published an article saying that the U.S. monthly employment report ignores American Indians. The economic well-being of this group receives little attention and is largely left out of the discussion. There are nearly 200 American Indian tribes in California, only half of which are recognized by the federal government. Although the Biden administration appointed the first American Indian cabinet minister, the political participation rate and political influence of Indians are still way too low compared to their share of the American population.

According to a poll conducted by the Harvard T.H Chan School of Public Health, more than one third of Native Americans have experienced neglect, violence, humiliation and discrimination in the workplace, and American Indians living in Indian populated areas are more likely to be subject to discrimination when dealing with the police, at work and during voting. According to the U.S. Department of the Interior, American Indians are twice as likely to be jailed for minor crimes as other ethnic groups. The incarceration rate of Indian men is four times that of white men, and the rate of Indian women is six times that of white women.

The Atlantic commented that from the expulsion, slaughter and forced assimilation back in history to the current widespread poverty and neglect, the American Indians, once the owner of this continent, now have a very weak voice in American society. American Indian writer Rebecca Nagel pointed out sharply that being made invisible is a new type of racial discrimination against American Indians and other indigenous peoples. The Los Angeles Times commented that the unjust treatment of Native Americans is deeply embedded in the social structure and legal system of the United States.

6. Endangered culture

From the 1870s to the late 1920s, the U.S. government forcibly implemented the system of American Indian boarding schools in Native American areas to impose English and Christian education on Indian children. There were even cases of Indian children being kidnapped and forced to attend schools in many places. The system of American Indian boarding schools imposed on Native Americans, as part of the history of the United States, caused irreparable damage, especially to the youths and children. Many Native Americans of the younger generation found themselves unable to gain a foothold in mainstream society and felt difficult to preserve and promote their own traditional culture, which leaves them bewildered and anguished about their own culture and identity.

In these boarding schools, American Indian children’s braids, a symbol of courage, were cut off, and their traditional clothing burned. They were strictly prohibited from speaking their mother tongue and violators would be beaten hard. In these schools, military-style management was imposed on Native American children who suffered from not only corporal punishment by mentors, but also sexual abuse. Quite a few American Indian children fell ill and even died due to harsh education methods, forced way of living, homesickness and malnutrition.

The U.S. government had also enacted laws prohibiting Native Americans from performing religious rituals which have been passed down through the generations, and those involved in such activities would be arrested and imprisoned. Since the 20th century, with the rise of the Civil Rights Movement in the United States, the protection of Native Americans’ traditional culture and history has improved to some extent. However, due to the serious damage that has already been inflicted, what is left now are mostly cultural relics preserved by later generations using the English language instead.

Rebecca Nagle believes that information about Native Americans has been systematically removed from mainstream media and popular culture. According to a report by National Indian Education Association, 87% of state-level U.S. history textbooks do not mention the post-1900 history of indigenous people. According to the Smithsonian Institution, things taught about Native Americans in American schools are full of inaccurate information and fail to present the real picture of the sufferings of indigenous people. Rick Santorum, a former Republican senator from Pennsylvania, said publicly at the Young America’s Foundation that “We birthed a nation from nothing. I mean, there was nothing here ... but candidly, there isn’t much Native American culture in American culture.” His remarks dismissed and negated the influence of indigenous people in American culture.

Ⅲ. Domestic criticism long ignored by the U.S. government over the “genocide” of American Indians

First, the academic community has a shared view on this issue. Since the 1970s, American academics have begun to use the term “genocide” to denounce U.S. policies toward American Indians. In the 1990s, American Holocaust: The Conquest of the New World by David E. Stannard, a professor at the University of Hawaii, and A Little Matter of Genocide by Ward L. Churchill, a former professor at the University of Colorado, sent shock waves across the academic community. Bloo","The results showed that only 66% of the 4.7 million eligible Native American voters were registered, and more than 1.5 million eligible Native American voters could not meaningfully exercise their right to vote due to political barriers.

244,244,https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-inner-core-superionic-matter-weird-solid-liquid,Weird ‘superionic’ matter could make up Earth’s inner core,"A quirky material that behaves like a mishmash of liquid and solid could be hidden deep in the Earth.

Computer simulations described in two studies suggest that the material in Earth’s inner core, which includes iron and other, lighter elements, may be in a “superionic” state. That means that while the iron stays put, as in a solid, the lighter elements flow like a liquid.

The research gives a potential peek at the inner workings of an enigmatic, inaccessible realm of the planet. According to conventional scientific wisdom, Earth’s core consists of a liquid outer core surrounding a solid inner core (SN: 1/28/19). But beyond knowing that the inner core is rich in iron, scientists don’t know exactly which other elements are present, and in what quantities.

“The inner core is very difficult to scrutinize simply because it’s so deep beneath our feet,” says geophysicist Hrvoje Tkalčić of Australian National University in Canberra.

Seismic waves stirred up by earthquakes can plow through the inner core, providing clues to what’s inside. But measurements of these waves have left researchers puzzled. The velocity of one type of wave, called a shear wave, is lower than expected for solid iron or for many types of iron alloys — mixtures of iron with other materials. “That is a mystery about the inner core,” says geophysicist Yu He of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Guiyang.

In one new study, He and colleagues simulated a group of 64 iron atoms, along with various types of lighter elements — hydrogen, carbon and oxygen — under pressures and temperatures expected for the inner core. In a normal solid, atoms arrange themselves in an orderly grid, holding fast to their positions. In a superionic material, some of the atoms arrange neatly, as in a solid, while others are liquid-like free spirits that slip right through the solid lattice. In the simulation, the researchers found, the lighter elements moved about while the iron stayed in place.

That superionic status slowed shear waves, the researchers report February 9 in Nature, suggesting the weird phase of matter could explain the unexpected shear wave velocity measured in the inner core.

Shear waves, also known as secondary or S waves, jiggle the Earth perpendicular to their direction of travel, like the undulations that move along a jump rope that’s wiggled up and down (SNS: 1/12/18). Other waves, called primary or P waves, compress and expand the Earth in a direction parallel to their travel, like an accordion being squeezed.

To really explain the inner core, scientists must find a combination of elements that keeps with everything scientists know about the inner core, including its S wave velocity, P wave velocity and its density. “You have to match all three things, otherwise it doesn’t work,” says mineral physicist John Brodholt of University College London.

In a study published in August 2021 in Earth and Planetary Science Letters, Brodholt and colleagues did just that. A simulation of iron, silicon and hydrogen atoms reproduced the inner core’s known characteristics. In the simulation, the material was also superionic: The iron and silicon stayed in position while the hydrogen flowed like a liquid.

But Brodholt notes that their result is just one possible explanation for the inner core’s properties. Brodholt and his colleagues have previously found other combinations of elements that could explain the inner core without going superionic, he says, leaving unresolved the question of what lurks in Earth’s deepest depths.

Another puzzle of Earth’s heart is the fact that the inner core’s structure seems to change over time. This has previously been interpreted as evidence that the inner core rotates at a different rate than the rest of the Earth. But He and colleagues suggest that it could instead result from the motions of liquid-like light elements swirling inside the inner core and changing the distribution of elements over time. “This paper sort of offers an explanation for both of these phenomena” — the slow shear wave velocity and the shifting structure — says Tkalčić, who was not involved with either new study.

One thing missing is laboratory experiments showing how these combinations of elements behave under inner core conditions, says geophysicist Daniele Antonangeli of Sorbonne University in Paris, who was not involved with the new research. Such tests could help confirm whether the simulations are correct.

Previous experiments have found evidence that water ice can go superionic, perhaps under conditions found inside Uranus or Neptune (SN: 2/5/18). But researchers can’t yet probe the behavior of superionic materials under the conditions thought to exist inside Earth’s core. So scientists will have to keep pushing the tests to further extremes, Antonangeli says. “The experimentalist that is within me craves seeing experimental validation of this.”","Computer simulations described in two studies suggest that the material in Earth’s inner core, which includes iron and other, lighter elements, may be in a “superionic” state.

245,245,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/pfizer-covid-vaccine-kids-fda-authorization-postponed-rcna15730,Pfizer postpones FDA request for Covid vaccine for kids under 5,"Pfizer-BioNTech is postponing its rolling application to the Food and Drug Administration to expand the use of its two-dose Covid-19 vaccine for children ages 6 months to 4 years.

The move means that vaccines for this age group will not be available in the coming weeks, a setback for parents eager to vaccinate their young children.

Pfizer said on Friday that it will wait for its data on a three-dose series of the vaccine, because it believes three doses ""may provide a higher level of protection in this age group."" Data on the third dose is expected in early April, the company said.

Pfizer said in December that two doses didn’t generate a strong enough immune response in its trial of children ages 2 to 4. For young children, Pfizer’s vaccine has a dosage of 3 micrograms. For children ages 5 to 11, the dosage is higher, at 10 micrograms.

Still, the company asked the FDA this month to authorize these first two doses, with a plan to submit additional data in the coming weeks on a third dose. The full vaccination series would be three doses.

The FDA was expected to publish an analysis of the Pfizer data Friday, ahead of an advisory committee meeting next week. The FDA said Friday the meeting has been postponed.

Two people familiar with the FDA’s plans said there had already been a lot of pushback on the agency from outside experts who had concerns that Pfizer’s data wasn’t sufficient. The experts felt, one of the people said, that their concerns were “falling on deaf ears” within the agency.

Federal regulators had initially wanted to begin reviewing the data on two doses of the vaccine while Pfizer continued to gather data on a three-dose regimen.

Regulators believed two doses would provide enough — though less than ideal — protection against the omicron variant of the coronavirus as pediatric cases surged.

However, Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said Friday that after regulators reviewed the company’s two-dose data, they decided they needed to see the three-dose data before considering authorization.

Parents should be ""reassured,"" Marks said, adding the agency takes its ""responsibility for reviewing these vaccines very seriously because we're parents as well,"" he said.

On Tuesday, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla told CNBC the chances are “very high” the FDA would authorize the vaccine for young children.

“I think that they will be pleased with the data and they will approve,” Bourla told CNBC’s Meg Tirrell, while noting that the regulatory process still has to play out.

Pfizer's request for authorization for two doses was an unusual request, given that the first two shots didn't work and there is no guarantee that adding a third dose will be sufficient.

John Moore, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Weill Cornell Medical College, said Pfizer had to make a decision about which dose to study in the clinical trials.

""They have to make the best guess about what dosage to use in young children and they got it wrong, they underdosed,"" he said.

246,246,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/family-doctor-gp-healthcare-healthier-sg-2551331,Singapore residents to be invited to enrol with a family doctor as first line of care,"SINGAPORE: Residents here will be invited to enrol with a general practitioner (GP) or polyclinic doctor of their choice as their first line of care from next year, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Wednesday (Mar 9).

The GPs and polyclinic doctors, also called family physicians, will support these individuals throughout their life for different health needs to ensure continuity of care, MOH said in a press release.

Speaking during his ministry’s Committee of Supply debate, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said that MOH will probably start with people in their 40s and above.

“That is when chronic illnesses may start to set in. We will have to build up the participation base progressively,” Mr Ong said.

Residents will be enrolled based on where they live. Currently, close to nine in 10 residents visit a family physician or hospital near their home.

However, people can choose doctors far away from their home, MOH said, giving the example of those who continue to visit doctors from their childhood.

Even after enrolment, people can make changes when the need arises, for instance, when they move to a new house.

The initiative is a major part of a new strategy called Healthier SG which outlines a “major reform of the healthcare sector”, including the integration of GPs into the public healthcare ecosystem and focus on preventive care.

“Studies have shown that people who go to only one family doctor consistently are generally healthier and have fewer hospitalisation and emergency department visits,” Mr Ong said.

This is because the doctor and the care team know them well and can better detect early signs of any problems timely and accurately, he added.

Only three in five Singaporeans currently have a regular doctor, he noted.

The rest tend to doctor-hop, for instance, to one doctor for hypertension medicine and another doctor for a medical certificate for cough and cold, Mr Ong said.

“There is no one family doctor who knows our overall health condition and family health history well enough, to be able to see the link between different care episodes,” he said.

“We can leverage GPs to attend to more patients, not for coughs and colds, but devoting time to provide preventive care.”","SINGAPORE: Residents here will be invited to enrol with a general practitioner (GP) or polyclinic doctor of their choice as their first line of care from next year, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Wednesday (Mar 9).

Over the years, many diets have been proposed for keeping healthy or reducing the risk of specific diseases, but few of them have stood up to rigorous scientific scrutiny. One exception, however, appears to be the Mediterranean diet. Increasingly, studies are showing that there are significant health benefits for people who follow this eating plan. Not only has research shown that it reduces cardiovascular disease, but it may also benefit cognition, decrease diabetes risk, reduce the risk of some cancers, and alleviate symptoms of multiple sclerosis.

What is the Mediterranean diet? The Mediterranean diet is an umbrella term referring to diets based on the historic eating habits of people who live around the Mediterranean Sea. According to the American Heart Association , which recommends this type of diet for cardiovascular health, its key features are: high intake of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, beans, and legumes

low-fat or fat-free dairy products, fish, poultry, non-tropical vegetable oils, and nuts

limited added sugars, sugary beverages, sodium, highly processed foods, refined carbohydrates, saturated fats, and fatty or processed meats. The Harvard School of Public Health adds to these recommendations, emphasizing the importance of healthy fats — olive oil, avocados, nuts, and oily fish. It advises that people should eat red meat only occasionally, but get their protein from fish or seafood at least twice a week and eat small quantities of poultry, eggs, and dairy most days. Although water should be a person’s main drink, people may also drink one or two small glasses of red wine each day, as per the traditional Mediterranean diet. Researchers add, however, that a healthy diet should also be paired up with some form of enjoyable physical activity every day. Dr. Scott Kaiser, a geriatrician, and director of Geriatric Cognitive Health for the Pacific Neuroscience Institute at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA, noted: “Research supports the benefits of adopting healthy lifestyle habits and indicates the critical importance this can play in shaping our future individual and collective health. […] Start with including lots of fresh vegetables — especially green leafy vegetables — and then enjoy fresh fruits— like berries — and other antioxidant-rich foods, along with fish, olive oil, and other foods rich in brain-healthy omega-3s.”

Why Mediterranean diets are healthy Mediterranean diets have long been associated with benefits to cardiovascular health. In the mid-20th century, the Seven Countries study showed that dietary patterns in the Mediterranean and in Japan in the 1960s were associated with low rates of coronary heart disease and all-cause mortality. Since then, research has shown that this type of diet not only benefits cardiovascular health, but it also reduces the risk of many other health conditions. And recently, evidence has been increasing for the wide-ranging health benefits of following a Mediterranean diet. But what makes Mediterranean diets so healthy, exactly? “The Mediterranean diet is characterized by high fruit and vegetables, high fiber, high levels of ‘good fats,’ moderate intakes of fish and meat, low amounts of high processed foods and sugary treat foods,” noted Dr. Eamon Laird, a visiting research fellow at Trinity College, Dublin, in Ireland. “These food components give high amounts of fiber, good fats, antioxidants, polyphenols, vitamins and minerals — choline, vitamin C, potassium, B-vitamins, vitamin D from fish, etc. — [and] proteins which give health benefits throughout a large number of organ and tissue systems,” he explained.

Mediterranean diet and CVD Lots of research has investigated the effect of a Mediterranean diet on the risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). A meta-analysis of several studies published in March 2023, with a pooled sample of more than 700,000 female participants, has found that, by adhering closely to a Mediterranean diet, women reduced their risk of CVD by 24%, and their risk of death from any cause by 23%. According to Dr. Laird, “[w]omen are also much more likely to stick with the diet compared to men, which could explain why we see more of the health benefits in women.” The meta-analysis seems to confirm the findings of previous research. For example, in 2015, another meta-analysis had found that the Mediterranean diet could be a major factor in preventing CVD. And it was the complete diet, rather than any particular aspect, that seemed to have this effect, as Dr. Joanna Hodges, an assistant teaching professor of nutritional sciences at Pennsylvania State University, told MNT. “[The study] concludes that no specific component of the Mediterranean diet has been shown to be as beneficial as the whole diet [in CVD prevention],” she told us.

Mediterranean diet and cognitive health There is also increasing evidence that the diet may enhance cognitive function. A study published in March 2023 that used UK Biobank data has just reported that individuals with a higher adherence to a Mediterranean diet had up to 23% lower risk for dementia compared with those who had lower adherence to a Mediterranean diet. The study, which used data from more than 60,000 people, concluded that the Mediterranean diet lowered dementia risk even in those with a genetic predisposition for dementia. The authors conclude that adopting a diet high in healthy, plant-based foods may be a strategy for reducing dementia risk. Another study, also published in March 2023, which looked at postmortem Alzheimer’s pathology, found that those who had followed a Mediterranean or MIND diet, particularly one rich in leafy greens, had a much lower beta-amyloid load. Beta-amyloid is thought to be responsible for many of the symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. The diet may also be beneficial for people with multiple sclerosis (MS). A preliminary study to be presented at the American Academy of Neurology’s 75th Annual Meeting in April 2023, found that people with MS who followed a Mediterranean diet had a 20% lower risk of cognitive impairment than those who followed it the least.

Mediterranean diet and cancer The diet has been found to both reduce the risk of some cancers and improve the efficacy of some cancer treatments. A 2019 review found that high adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with a lower rate of several cancers, including breast, colorectal, and prostate cancers. This study concluded that the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of components of the diet “prevent and counteract DNA damages and slow down the development of various forms of cancer.” For prostate cancer, recent research has shown that eating a diet high in colorful fruits and vegetables both reduces the risk of developing prostate cancer and speeds recovery in those who undergo radiation therapy for the disease. The studies, from South Australia, found that diets high in lycopene and selenium reduced the risk. Tomatoes, melons, papayas, grapes, peaches, watermelons, and cranberries are rich in lycopene, and white meat, fish, shellfish, eggs, and nuts contain high concentrations of selenium. All of these are recommended in the Mediterranean diet. And it is not only prostate cancer patients whose treatment may be more effective on a Mediterranean diet. A recent study presented at UEG Week 2022 found that the diet was significantly associated with an improved response to immunotherapy drugs in people with advanced melanoma.

How it works Although the exact mechanism by which the Mediterranean diet benefits health is unclear, there is increasing evidence that the diet can have five main effects : lowering lipids

protecting against oxidative stress, inflammation, and platelet aggregation

modifying hormones and growth factors involved in cancer pathogenesis

restricting specific amino acids

influencing the gut microbiome to produce metabolites that benefit metabolic health. Dr. Laird explained to MNT how some components of the diet benefit health: “Omega-3 fatty acids, phytosterols, resveratrol , vitamins, and polyphenols may contribute to lower levels of inflammation ( CRP , inflammatory cytokines ), and may improve endothelial function. By reducing levels of inflammation, improving blood flow, improving insulin sensitivity, and improving lipid metabolism, by default you are also reducing some of the major risk factors for CVD, cognitive decline, cancers, and diabetes.” Studies have found that it is best to take in these nutrients in their natural form as part of a healthy diet, such as the Mediterranean diet. Although they can be obtained through supplements, there may be side effects to taking excessive amounts.","Share on Pinterest Several recent studies suggest the Mediterranean diet can help keep several diseases and chronic conditions at bay.

250,250,https://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/urgent-action-climate-change-needed-secure-liveable-future-un-report-w-rcna17764,"Urgent action on climate change needed ‘to secure a liveable future,’ U.N. report warns","Climate change is no longer a far-off threat — it’s an ongoing disaster that is already endangering humans and natural environments around the world, according to an urgent new report from the United Nations that says the world is running out of time to stave off the most devastating consequences of global warming.

The report, released Monday by the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, outlines the increasing risk that climate change poses to human health, infrastructure, the stability of food and water resources and the biodiversity of the planet’s ecosystems.

The assessment, produced by 270 scientists from 67 countries who make up the IPCC’s so-called Working Group II, represents broad consensus within the research community about how global warming is affecting people and the environment — and the potential consequences of inaction.

“The scientific evidence is unequivocal: climate change is a threat to human wellbeing and the health of the planet,” Hans-Otto Pörtner, a climatologist and co-chair of the IPCC’s Working Group II, said in a statement. “Any further delay in concerted global action will miss a brief and rapidly closing window to secure a liveable future.”

The report found humanity will have to contend with multiple climate hazards over the coming decades if global warming exceeds 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit). Human-caused climate change has already contributed to the planet’s warming about 1.1 degrees Celsius (2 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels.

The effect of climate change on the availability of food and water is particularly worrisome. Heat waves, droughts and floods — all of which are aggravated by climate change — have already exposed millions of people around the world to acute food and water insecurity, according to the report.

“Overall, the picture is stark for food systems,” one of the authors of the report, Rachel Bezner Kerr, a professor of global development at Cornell University, said Sunday in a news briefing. “No one is left unaffected by climate change.”

Although climate change is expected to hit every region of the planet, the assessment found that people in Africa, Asia, South America and Central America are particularly vulnerable and at greater risk of negative consequences, including death. Residents of the Arctic and small island countries similarly shoulder an unequal burden of climate impacts, according to the report.

Bezner Kerr said taking aggressive action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and slow the pace of climate change will help reduce the more dire consequences of global warming, adding that “every increased amount of warming will increase the risk of severe impacts.”

The IPCC report also highlighted the mounting threat of global warming to human health, including the impact of climate change on people’s mental well-being — a first for the IPCC. Emerging research has shown, for instance, that increased exposure to heat waves, wildfires and other extreme weather events can take a toll on mental health.

Among the dire warnings addressed in the new assessment is that the hardest-hit people and ecosystems are also the ones least able to cope, including lower-income populations and low-lying coastal regions that are at risk from rising sea levels.

Many of the risks worsened by climate change are interwoven with issues already faced in those communities, such as rising social inequality, the unsustainable use of natural resources, losses and damages from disasters and other extreme weather events and ongoing repercussions from the Covid-19 pandemic.

“Our assessment clearly shows that tackling all these different challenges involves everyone — governments, the private sector, civil society — working together to prioritize risk reduction, as well as equity and justice, in decision-making and investment,” Working Group II co-chair Debra Roberts, the head of the Sustainable and Resilient City Initiatives Unit in eThekwini Municipality in Durban, South Africa, said in a statement.

The cost of inaction, on the other hand, could be devastating, according to the report. In addition to threats to humans, climate change is causing irreversible impacts on certain species and ecosystems, said an author of the report, Camille Parmesan, an adjunct professor of geological sciences at the University of Texas at Austin.

“It’s very, very clear that wild species and natural systems are already being pushed right up against hard limits,” Parmesan said. “That’s why we’re seeing species going extinct. That’s why we’re seeing the most sensitive ecosystems — the mountaintops, the High Arctic — having massive changes.”

John Kerry, the U.S. special presidential envoy for climate, said the IPCC assessment paints a “dire picture” of how humanity is already being affected by global warming and outlines the risks of ignoring climate science.

“We have seen the increase in climate-fueled extreme events, and the damage that is left behind — lives lost and livelihoods ruined,” Kerry said in a statement. “The question at this point is not whether we can altogether avoid the crisis — it is whether we can avoid the worst consequences.”

The IPCC, established in the late 1980s, consists of thousands of scientists across 195 member governments who pore over the most recent published and peer-reviewed research on global warming and compile the findings into a report on the current state of the climate.

The new report is part of the IPCC’s latest summary on climate change, called the Sixth Assessment Report, or AR6. The full assessment consists of four sections: the Working Group I report on the science of climate change, which was released last year; the Working Group II report on the vulnerabilities and socioeconomic impacts; the upcoming Working Group III report on possible ways to mitigate climate change, which will be released in April; and the Synthesis Report, which reviews the findings from all of the working groups and integrates relevant information for policymakers.","The report, released Monday by the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, outlines the increasing risk that climate change poses to human health, infrastructure, the stability of food and water resources and the biodiversity of the planet’s ecosystems.

SETL has partnered with New York-based Digital Asset to create a new protocol which can be used by regulated institutions to launch interoperable tokens.



The new protocol, modelled on Citi’s Regulated Liability Network (RLN) initiative, will be developed and operated to enable banks, central banks and other regulated institutions to create tokens for their customers.



Each token will represent a promise from the issuer to the holder of the token. Transferring tokens between banks will be handled by the network which will mint, burn and transfer tokens to achieve real-time settlement between the customers of any regulated institution.



The joint initiative will be ready for testing later this year. SETL and Digital Asset have invited interested institutions to open a partition on its prototype network to test use-cases and to familiarise themselves with the new protocol.



Philippe Morel, CEO of SETL, comments: “There is real momentum behind the RLN model and we are excited to join forces with the Digital Asset team to fulfil the promise of blockchain and DLT for banks and their customers everywhere. This approach will be easy for organisations to embrace and will provide an equally simple model for Central Bank Digital Currency, bank and e-money coins, as well as any kind of tokenised liability such as bonds, loans and shares.”



Yuval Rooz, CEO of Digital Asset, says: “We have always taken pride in enabling our clients to innovate and this is no exception. Interoperability is a major goal for us and by working with SETL we will produce a world class network with the ability to connect and communicate across all existing clients’ solutions to serve the regulated community.”

IQ-EQ Launchpad will aim to expand inclusivity for the wider asset management industry and foster a self-sustaining network of women in senior leadership roles.



The Launchpad suite of services is designed to help women overcome the specific challenges they face launching their first funds, and was prompted by a recognition of the limited opportunities for women in the industry, says IQ-EQ.



Funds with over 50 per cent women ownership or a woman founder will be eligible to receive preferential service terms, tailored fund administration solutions, capacity building and access to a global network.



The project will be overseen and promoted by Serge Krancenblum, group executive chairman and leader of IQ-EQ’s diversity and inclusion strategy. Justin Partington, group head of funds, will be the project sponsor.



Atlantica Ventures, an African venture capital fund which provides early-stage funding and support to startups in Africa, is the first company to sign up to the programme.



Commenting on the initiative, Krancenblum, says: “Only 15 per cent of all private equity or venture capital firms are gender-balanced, let alone women-led. As a leading member of the fund ecosystem we believe that we can play an important role in addressing the gender imbalance within the asset management industry. We have leveraged our business model and contacts to put together a comprehensive support package that will help first-time women fund managers to succeed.”



Emma Crabtree, group chief commercial officer at IQ-EQ, comments: “This is an exciting and vital step that we are taking. Gender diversity in fund management will achieve not just better outcomes for women, but also for investors and the industry at large. Having recently joined the business it has been so encouraging to see this and other initiatives being organised.”

After all, he was in Primary 5 when he last participated in the Young Scientist Badge scheme – a flagship programme under the Science Centre Singapore that aims to cultivate an interest in science among primary school students.

Students accomplish a list of tasks to obtain badges representing various science disciplines, from mathematics to meteorology.

Mr Looi, now 49, recalled the flyer promoting a badge that wasn’t around during his time: The Young Sustainability Champion badge.

As he was working in a sustainability-related role at the time, he thought that signing up his daughter, Shavonne, who was then eight, to obtain the badge would be a “good way” to introduce her to sustainability.

It did more than that. It unlocked Shavonne's interest in science, leading her to collect 14 more badges. One was the Young Energy Saver badge.

“One of the tasks (under that badge) was to find the electrical appliances that pick up the most electricity. She didn't care (about energy consumption) as a kid, and our place is quite old, we don’t have the energy labels. But because of the task, I brought her out to Best Denki,” said Mr Looi.

“I think one of the tasks was to learn to read the energy labels as well … so she went to look at all the different appliances with the energy label. Then she realised: ‘Oh, okay, air-con (consumes) quite a lot (of energy).’ It started to give (her) a lot of awareness.”","Students accomplish a list of tasks to obtain badges representing various science disciplines, from mathematics to meteorology.

Nearly a year after New Brunswick health officials raised the alarm about a mysterious brain disease afflicting the province’s residents, an expert committee has determined there is no evidence of such a disease.

“The committee has concluded that no such syndrome exists,” Health Minister Dorothy Shephard told a news conference Thursday.

Last March, provincial health officials alerted doctors, nurses and pharmacists about a cluster of residents with an unknown and potentially new neurological syndrome with symptoms similar to those of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, but CJD was ruled out in the New Brunswick cases.

“It most likely is a new disease. We haven’t seen this anywhere else,” chief medical officer of health Dr. Jennifer Russell said at the time. The cluster of 48 patients reported symptoms such as rapidly progressing dementia, muscle spasms and atrophy.

But after questions were raised about the existence of a new syndrome, Shephard appointed a committee of six neurologists from the province, along with co-chairs from the two regional health authorities and a medical officer of health, to conduct a clinical review. Shephard noted last October that 46 of the 48 cases were diagnosed by a single neurologist.

In their report released Thursday, the committee rules out a common illness among the 48. Although some of the patients had unusual symptoms, the committee wrote, “there is no evidence of a cluster of neurological syndrome of unknown cause.”

Instead, the committee found possible alternative diagnoses for 41 of the patients, including Alzheimer’s disease, various forms of dementia, post-concussion syndrome and cancer. Ten of the 48 patients have died and six of them had autopsies completed. “These diagnoses included such conditions as Alzheimer’s disease, Lewy body disease, or cancer,” the report says.

The committee said it initially had difficulty getting the information it needed to complete its review.

“Despite multiple attempts, (Public Health New Brunswick) was not able to obtain the needed information from the main referring neurologist,” they wrote. “Compounding this, in New Brunswick individual medical records are contained within various systems that are set up to protect the privacy rights and personal and medical information of its citizens.” They say special approvals had to be sought to get the files.

Shephard said it’s important now to ensure the patients are getting proper treatment. “The focus now must turn to providing these individuals with the followup assessment and care that they need for what are most certainly serious illnesses,” she said.

Families of the 48 patients met virtually with Shephard ahead of the report’s publication. Many of the patients had recently received letters from the committee to say they don’t have an unknown neurological condition and should contact their doctor for more details.

In a statement after the meeting, patients and families questioned the committee’s conclusions and accused the government of abandoning scientific rigour “in exchange for political expediency.” They said the committee did no additional testing.

“Our lives and the lives of our loved ones will not be railroaded by a slipshod investigation that offers no answers to our pain and suffering,” the statement said.

Steve Ellis, whose father Roger is one of the original 48 cases, told reporters Thursday that he was disgusted by the meeting with the minister and the public briefing.

“They have chosen to close their incomplete investigation but we are not going to stop asking for a proper scientific investigation,” he said. Ellis said the families are considering a crowdfunding effort to raise money to fund their own study.

Ellis said the families are aware of up to 100 more patients who have presented to a specialized clinic in Moncton – known as the MIND clinic – with similar symptoms. While Shephard said Thursday she was unaware of such cases, she did confirm that the clinic is now seeing more than 200 patients from across the province.

The committee recommended that the clinic continue to provide support to patients identified in the cluster. It also said it could not determine if the main referring neurologist sought second opinions before referring individuals to the cluster.

“As such, it is the recommendation of the committee that any future cases being considered for a novel syndrome or disease be reviewed by a second specialist,” the report says. “Should the two physicians not be able to reach a consensus for identifying a patient as potentially having a novel condition, the case would be presented at a board of specialty doctors for determination.”

Ellis said families have been left in the dark about their loved ones’ conditions.

“None of these letters that families have reviewed with their doctors indicate a definitive diagnosis,” he said. “They use the words suspected, probable, strong, but never say, ‘You have this.”‘

257,257,https://en.hdbuzz.net/320,Huntington’s disease therapeutics conference 2022 - Day 1,"Good morning from sunny Palm Springs! After a 2-year hiatus because of COVID, the HD Therapeutics Conference is back in person this year - the biggest annual gathering of HD researchers! Our Twitter updates are compiled below. Continue to follow live updates for the rest of the conference with the hashtag #HDTC2022.

Day 1 is focused on research updates from some of the top HD labs around the world.

Huntingtin protein building blocks

Prof. Monckton describing his team’s work with South African HD patients.

Dr. Paolo Beuzer (CHDI) and Dr. Vanessa Wheeler (MGH) are introducing the first session of research talks, which will focus on ways to study and potentially manipulate CAG repeats in huntingtin DNA and RNA.

CAG repeats – more complex than they seem

The first speaker of the day is Darren Monckton from the University of Glasgow. The Monckton lab researches the repeats in the DNA sequence in diseases like Huntington’s disease.

While the CAG repeat seems simple because it’s so short, it’s actually quite complicated. The size of the CAG repeat alone doesn’t account for the age that someone will develop HD symptoms. CAG codes for the protein building block glutamine. But other protein letters can also code for glutamine. One of those is CAA, which can also contribute to the polyglutamines in HD. These CAA interruptions can also affect the age at which someone gets symptoms. Having a CAA interruption, which is rare, causes an earlier age of onset compared to HD individuals who only have pure CAG repeats. Changes in the “purity” of the CAG repeat tract i.e. whether it has these interruptions or not, could affect a process called somatic instability which we wrote about here: https://en.hdbuzz.net/291

The EnrollHD database from which these observations are made, is biased with data from lots of European and North American people, but not from other parts of the world. The Monckton lab decided to tackle this by teaming up with a group in South Africa. In this South African population, the Monckton lab saw a very similar distribution of the different types of CAG tracts, with or without these interruptions. However there were some differences in another part of the HTT gene…

After the CAGs, the HTT protein contains letters, CCG, that make up a protein building block called proline. The Monckton lab sequenced how many prolines HD patients in South Africa had and found this area of the protein differs from HD patients with European descent. They used this data to look at how the number of proline repeats and the letters that make up those proline repeats affect age of onset. People with HD whose prolines who had a slightly different spelling had a 10 year earlier onset of HD symptoms. Tracking the way these protein building blocks are spelled can help improve diagnosis or prediction of age at disease onset. Overall, what this means is that other changes in the huntingtin genetic recipe can affect the disease - HD genetics is proving to be much more pesky and complex than it first seems. Understanding these variations which lead to earlier or later symptom onset might help researchers find new ways to make medicines for people with HD - that’s the hope.

The researchers conclude that these other changes in the huntingtin recipe are not affecting somatic instability but perhaps are affecting the message made from the huntingtin recipe. The mRNA message molecule structure might be changing. Interestingly, none of the changes we’ve just described change the huntingtin protein itself. They only change the spelling of the gene or “recipe”. This suggests that it’s not protein-related changes that are affecting disease, but rather changes at the RNA-level. Altering the spelling of the RNA can change the way the molecule folds. No one yet knows what those folding changes mean, but they could be leveraged to develop therapeutics.

Dr. Monckton concludes, even though it all seems so simple - that people with HD have increased CAG repeats - it’s actually very complicated! But research like this gets at how we can take advantage of this complexity to design new drugs.

Examining how HD affects individual cells in the brain

Next up is Steve McCarroll who is affiliated with the Harvard Medical School and Broad Institute. Steve will be telling us about his research on understanding HD at the level of single cells in the brain.

The brain is made up of lots of different cell types that perform specific functions. Dr. McCarroll highlights the need to understand how these many different types of cells are affected by HD. His lab uses specialized techniques to separate out different types of cells and understand their genetics. They are committed to sharing the methodology widely to benefit the entire HD research community.

Dr McCarroll has found a way to speed up his analysis - he combines human brain samples from HD patients together, then separates the data out after. Getting data faster is a big advantage because it allows researchers to get their answers as fast as possible. These types of large scale analyses are made possible through brain donations after a person with HD passes. Brain donations to HD research are a major way the field can get answers about HD in the only organism we care about curing HD in - people.

The McCarroll lab is applying these techniques to understand how the proportion of different kinds of cells in the brain changes as HD symptoms progress. His lab has defined these changes as the disease progresses, which helps us understand the cellular composition of the brain in people with HD. In most people with HD, there is significant loss of cells called medium spiny neurons. Researchers have known this for a while, but Dr McCarroll has also shown there are cellular changes in many other cell types in the brain. The loss of cells is accompanied by changes in which genes turn on and off. Dr. McCarroll has mapped these changes in these genes in each cell type as the disease progresses - wow!

These types of data can identify different genes within specific cells that modify the disease. One of those disease-related modifications is associated with expansion of the CAG repeat as a person with HD ages.

Certain people with HD have an increase in their CAG repeats over time, particularly in the brain. These expansions can increase the age of onset for HD patients. Understanding what causes these expansions could help develop medicines to delay disease onset. Other genes, known as genetic modifiers, affect whether and how much a person’s CAG repeats will expand over time. McCarroll’s lab is looking at these modifiers within individual cells in many people!

Knowing how these processes change at such a small level produces a LOT of data that will give tons of information about how CAG expansion is changing in various cell types and how that affects disease progression. Interestingly, he found these CAG expansions happen to a much greater extent in medium spiny neurons, which are one of the most affected cell types by HD. This could be one of the reasons why this particular cell type is so vulnerable in HD. He’s also defined these changes in different cell types of the brain as well as different areas of the brain. Depending where in the brain a certain cell type is can also affect CAG expansion in that cell type. So it’s not just cell identity, but also cell location that matters! Understanding why both cell type and “neighborhood” in the brain affect CAG expansion will be an important next step towards developing therapies to combat it. This data from the McCarroll lab is hot off the presses and reflects recent breakthroughs in laboratory and analysis techniques. They plan to apply these techniques to more samples from people with various stages of HD.

HD mouse models

The next speaker is Dr. William Yang from the University of California, Los Angeles who will be telling us about his new mouse model, which his lab recently developed. We recently wrote about this new model: https://en.hdbuzz.net/318

No HD mouse model is perfect for studying HD, but different types can capture different aspects of the disease and allow for different types of experiments. For many years the Yang lab has specialized in creating mouse models to answer specific questions about HD. Choosing the right model for specific experiments is critical, since some mouse models only have certain features of HD - like altered gene expression or protein aggregation. The main innovation of the

Yang lab’s new mouse model is that it shows somatic instability, the growth of CAG repeats in certain cells over time. This allows researchers to understand the consequences of expansion to the health and behavior of the mice.

In these mice, the more CAG repeats expand, the more their behavior and brain cell health are affected, confirming for the first time in animals what we have suspected based on data from human blood, spinal fluid, and brain donations.

The lab is now using their new mouse model to better understand how unstable, expanding CAG repeats affect the huntingtin recipe and protein and the harm they may be doing in cells.

Dr. Yang also shared data from a different type of HD mouse model which is allowing them to study how genes get turned on and off over the course of HD. It’s great to see this question approached from multiple angles (along with the McCarroll lab and others). We’re taking a quick break now but will be back shortly with updates from the rest of this morning’s speakers. Stay tuned!

Processing the huntingtin message

Our next speaker is Dr. Gillian Bates from Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London. Dr. Bates will be updating us on how the huntingtin gene is processed and how we can perhaps use this information to develop therapeutics.

The huntingtin gene gets “spliced” to remove small bits of genetic information that sit between the code. The gene then gets put back together before the protein is made. This process is typically used to give cells diversity in the information they can create from a single gene. But this process can go wrong in HD. In HD, the huntingtin gene is used to create a very small fragment of a protein - called “exon 1”. This exon 1 contains the CAG repeats and is very toxic to cells.

Sandrine Humbert talking to us about her research on huntingtin protein during brain development

Dr. Bates looked at the amounts of exon 1 in HD mouse models and in different areas of brains from people with HD. She found that with longer CAG repeats, the splicing process making the exon1 protein happened more frequently. The Bates lab is experimenting with ways to detect and distinguish between different forms and pieces of the huntingtin protein created by splicing. They do this using different combinations of antibodies, a way to detect different parts of the protein. This work suggests the exon 1 fragment is the site of protein aggregation creation. Understanding how this process occurs can give us lots of clues about how to reduce these protein clumps.

The Bates lab specializes in innovative ways to try and see different forms of the protein under a microscope or in an assay, like creating novel mice and treating the tissue with different chemicals. They made a special mouse model where the splicing pattern is altered, and the exon1 fragment of the huntingtin protein should no longer be made. In these mice the lab looked at the levels of toxic protein clumps which are made compared to regular HD mouse models. In the new mouse model there were a lot less clumps suggesting the exon1 fragment is important for making the clumps. Next steps will involve exploring how differences in huntingtin clumping could change mouse behavior and the pattern of communication between brain cells. Sometimes huntingtin clumps show up near the cell’s nucleus - the part of the cell that houses genetic material. The Bates lab used multiple models to show that this only happens with human huntingtin, not mouse huntingtin. These data suggest there’s something unique about human huntingtin that leads to these pathogenic protein clumps. This may be a clue to why humans are the only species to naturally get HD!

Understanding which forms of huntingtin are most toxic and why will help us design drugs to combat its negative effects in (human!) brain cells.

Cellular handling of the huntingtin protein

Next up is Dr. Judith Frydman from Stanford University. She’ll be talking about why CAG repeat expansions can lead to problems with “trash tagging and disposal” systems in brain cells.

While we know the cause of HD, researchers don’t truly know the “normal” function of the huntingtin protein. What they do know is that it participates in a variety of different biological processes - kind of like a swiss army knife of the cell. Because of this, researchers debate if HD is a disease caused by disruption of other genes or a disruption of other proteins. Dr. Frydman’s work argues that HD, at least in part, results from disruption at the protein level.

Dr Frydman’s research focuses on understanding how the huntingtin message molecule, called mRNA, is turned into the protein molecule, through a process called translation. Stresses on cells (things like viral infection, reduced availability of protein building blocks, and changes in how the cell’s machinery works) can alter the way translation occurs. Researchers know that cells from people or animal models with HD have increased amounts of cellular stress. Dr Frydman’s lab have shown in their models, that under these conditions of stress, more huntingtin protein is made. When cells are making the huntingtin protein by translation, they use machinery called ribosomes. Frydman and colleagues show that when cells make mutated huntingtin, the ribosomes collide and cause a traffic jam on the huntingtin message. When the Frydman lab looked at what genes were altered on the message with and without the traffic jam, they found that many of those genes were involved in protein cleanup in cells.

One protein, called eIF5A, is depleted in HD models. eIF5A is important for helping the ribosomes to clear the traffic jams, so if less of this protein is around in HD, there will be more problems making new protein molecules and clearing away the old ones. Together, Dr. Frydman’s work suggests that a whole host of molecular disruptions that result from HD occur at the level of both the RNA message and the huntingtin protein, each contributing to the signs and symptoms of HD we see in patients and in HD models.

Disease effects caused by huntingtin

The second session is hosted by Dr. Balajee Somalinga (CHDI) and Dr. Ali Brivanlou (The Rockefeller University) and it will focus mainly on the huntingtin message and protein and their roles in health and disease.

Early effects caused by huntingtin

The first speaker of this session is Sandrine Humbert from INSERM, who will be talking to us about her research on the role of the huntingtin protein during brain development. The huntingtin protein has lots of jobs in the cell, one of which is to move different molecules around the cell. One of the molecules huntingtin helps transport in nerve cells is BDNF, which is important for supporting the health of brain cells. Both the normal and expanded forms of the huntingtin protein are made by cells in the very early stages of life. The Humbert lab thinks that errors made by the expanded form of the protein in people with HD may be responsible for the symptoms they suffer later in life. The Humbert lab has discovered that huntingtin is important for many functions in nerve cell development, including how these cells are originally formed, their final structure and how they ultimately work and connect with other nerve cells. In HD mouse models which the Humbert lab work on, this development doesn’t happen properly which may account for the neurodegeneration seen later in life for these mice. We wrote about this work previously here: https://en.hdbuzz.net/290

Dr. Humbert hypothesizes that the change in the way the cells in an HD brain connect sets them up to be vulnerable later in life when HD patients would typically develop symptoms.

Her lab’s latest work continues to explore huntingtin’s roles in health and in HD, including how HD affects nerve cell growth, structure, and movement. Creating more stability within the structure of the neurons, similar to supportive scaffolding on a building, seems to have positive effects on their health later on.

In summary, it seems that even though nerve cell development is different in HD models, the nerve cells are very resilient and symptoms can still take decades to present themselves.

Huntingtin in other species

Next up is Dr. Raffaele Iennaco from the University of Milan & Istituto Nazionale di Genetica Molecolare. His work uses stem cells to understand how the structure of the huntingtin exon1 fragment affects function.

Dr. Iennaco works with Dr. Elena Cattaneo’s lab, where he focuses on the use of special forms of stem cells known as “induced pluripotent stem cells” or iPSCs. These cells, derived from HD patients, enable the team to study the very beginning of the Huntingtin protein. This small piece reflects just a tiny bit of the Huntingtin protein - maybe 3% or so of the full protein. But this tiny bit plays an outsized role in Huntingtin’s jobs in the cell - particularly how it moves around the cell.

To better understand this small bit of the Huntingtin protein, Iennaco’s team determined the exact sequence of this region in 209 different animal species! This dramatically increases the numbers of species for which we have this kind of information.

The number of CAG’s across species varies quite a lot - in fish it always seems to be 4 CAGs, in lizards 5, whereas humans without HD have 17-20 CAG repeats. Why different species need different amounts of CAGs is a big mystery that Iennaco is interested in understanding. Other evidence from Iennaco’s work suggests that the huntingtin gene is unable to accept mutations - there are many fewer changes to huntingtin’s genetic code than would be expected by chance. Additional evidence for the importance of the huntingtin gene. In marmosets - go google that for a very cute monkey experience - there are actually two Huntingtin genes! This isn’t the case in any other species studied, but it suggests the power of looking at more than 200 species to find examples of rare genetic events to better understand the Huntingtin gene. Using their stem cells growing in the lab, Iennaco’s team could study the exact link between the length of the CAG repeat region and the ability of those cells to develop into brain cells called neurons. These experiments help us understand the importance of all the genetic diversity identified in their sequencing studies.

Dr.Yang outlines the huge number of mouse models of HD available

Next, Iennaco and team focused on the comparison of mouse and human Huntingtin. Strangely, while they are very similar, the human Huntingtin gene has been found to be more toxic than the mouse version, but we’ve not known why. The team is able to coax their stem cells grown in dishes to begin going through the very earliest phases of brain development. This allows them to study the importance of small changes (in CAG length or across species) and to measure their impact on brain development.

Using a very cool automated system, the team took images of approximately 5,000 different mini-brains in the lab to better understand the impact of tiny changes in Huntingtin’s sequence.

Many of the aspects of new brain cell growth they measured were more impacted by human Huntingtin rather than mouse Huntingtin. This suggests that there’s something about the human sequence that sets it apart, in its ability to be toxic to newly born brain cells. The team has narrowed in on a very specific region of the Huntingtin gene that they think explains why human versions of the HD gene are more toxic than those from mice. This supports the importance of genetic studies like this in animals.

Effects caused by huntingtin in astrocytes

Next up is a talk from Prof. Baljit Khakh, from UCLA. His lab is interested in a specific type of support cell - called an astrocyte - in HD. These aren’t the most vulnerable cells in HD - that’s neurons - but astrocytes job in life is to support neurons. While astrocytes don’t die early in HD, they definitely express the HD gene, and they show a number of changes in their shape and function when they express a mutant copy of the HD gene. Khakh’s lab wants to know whether these changes in astrocytes impact HD. Khakh’s lab began their work by looking at huge data sets generated from the brains of HD patients and animal models showing which genes were turned on and off, to look for hints that astrocytes might be working poorly. This seemed to be the case. There are changes in astrocytes in the brains of HD patients, but do they matter for the progression of HD, or are they just reflecting changes in other cell types?

A very cool Huntingtin-lowering tool called a “zinc finger” can shut down expression of the mutant Huntingtin gene. We’ve written about ZFPs before at Buzz, which you can read about here: https://en.hdbuzz.net/275

The UCLA team was able to develop viruses that deliver these Huntingtin-lowering payloads to different cell types in the brain, including neurons or astrocytes. This enables them to lower the Huntingtin gene in different types of cells. These new viruses very nicely reduce levels of the Huntingtin gene only in the targeted cell type, so the team is able to ask specific questions about the relationship between Huntingtin expression in particular cells, and HD-like symptoms in mice. Shutting down mutant Huntingtin in each cell type rescued many of the changes found in that cell type. When mutant huntingtin is shut down in neurons (the sick cell type in HD), they saw improvements in the astrocytes - the support cells!

This is weird! It suggests that there’s some kind of feedback loop happening between sick support cells and sick neurons in the HD brain. It also shows the power of manipulating specific cell types - things aren’t always as we assume. The team then asked the question - what happens to HD-like symptoms in HD mice if Huntingtin is lowered in astrocytes or neurons using a ZFP? Many of the symptoms they investigated were improved by knocking down the mutant huntingtin gene in neurons, but less so when they knocked it down in astrocytes.

This is important - Khakh loves astrocytes, and wanted to understand if they drive HD symptoms. They did a very good set of experiments and find that astrocytes are changed, but that changes in neurons remain the most important factor, in light of their results.

Processing the huntingtin message

Next up is Jose Lucas from Center for Molecular Biology Severo Ochoa (CBMSO) who will be speaking about how the huntingtin message is processed and how this differs in people with HD.

The process by which gene messages are processed is called splicing. This topic has cropped up in a few earlier talks that also looked at this process, and splicing is thought to create the toxic exon1 fragment of huntingtin. Splicing goes wrong in various other diseases, so understanding the similarities in this process between diseases could help answer questions about HD and the symptoms we see in patients such as loss of nerve cells. Lucas and colleagues looked to see which genes are affected by changes in the splicing process in HD. If a gene’s message is spliced incorrectly, this will often mean that less of the full protein product of that message will be made. Scientists in the Lucas lab showed that if they switched on a gene called RBFOX1 artificially, they could improve the symptoms in a HD mouse model by helping correct the splicing mistakes. Maybe this idea could be used to help make new medicines to treat HD?

Gene messages are also processed to remove a “tail” in their genetic code sequence which is made up of lots of the letter A repeating over and over. It turns out that in HD models, lots of messages keep their tails longer than they should, which will affect how they are turned into their protein products. One of the most affected proteins discovered in this research led the scientists to find out that people with HD have less of a vitamin called thiamine. They confirmed this by measuring the thiamine levels in the spinal fluid, showing reduced levels. The scientists are now pursuing the answers to two different questions in the clinic: Could thiamine levels be used as a biomarker for progression of HD? And can thiamine treatment improve symptoms in people with HD?

While these are commonly available vitamins the Lucas group is looking at, tightly controlled clinical trials are required for conclusive answers. Hopefully we will have updates for you soon on how this possible treatment might be working in people with HD.

Controling huntingtin protein degradation

Wrapping up the talks for today, Dr. Michael Rapé from Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of California, Berkeley will discuss his work on how huntingtin is degraded in the cell and how it might be used to treat HD. The Rapé lab is looking for small molecules that can be used to target the huntingtin protein so the cell’s machinery will break it down and remove it, a process known as protein degradation.

There are certain proteins in the cell that tag other proteins for degradation. So if you can control this process, you could control which proteins the cell degrades. This would be great for a disease like HD where we want to reduce or get rid of a harmful protein! One challenge with therapeutics for brain diseases is getting past the blood-brain barrier - the selective barrier that protects the brain from harmful things in the blood. The drugs the Rapé lab are developing are small compared to ASOs (like those developed by Roche and Wave) but are still big compared to most drug molecules.

Luckily scientists have shown that small molecule degraders can pass from the bloodstream into the brain which is great news for researchers looking to make degraders to treat diseases like HD.

Our cells make lots of different proteins, called E3 ligases, which are used to “tag the trash” in the cell and target it for degradation. If we could find an E3 that tags the huntingtin protein, we could harness it to develop a degrader molecule. The Rapé lab developed a screen that would allow them to identify E3 ligases that would be good targets. They identified an E3 ligase called RNF126 which seems to have all of the desired characteristics for developing of the huntingtin degrader molecule, harnessing RNF126. Next they tested if RNF126 could specifically degrade the huntingtin protein. They found that when expression of RNF126 was increased, it led to degradation of harmful huntingtin in cells!

But these experiments were done with just a fragment of harmful, expanded huntingtin. What happens when the same experiment is done with full-length huntingtin protein with an expanded CAG repeat? The results replicated! Together, these data suggest that they were able to find this needle in a haystack - the perfect enzyme that binds to huntingtin to naturally allow for its degradation in cells to prevent protein aggregation that causes disease.

The next steps are to move RNF126 forward in drug development to try and identify a compound called a molecular glue which forces RNF126 to help degrade huntingtin protein. We’ll be anxiously waiting to see what the next steps are for this exciting molecule!

Stay tuned for more updates!

Her heart was racing, too. Campbell decided to lie down, hoping rest would help. But when she woke up the following morning, she didn’t feel much better.

“I was still short of breath and fatigued, so I drove to urgent care, where they determined my resting heart rate was in the high 100s,” Campbell says. (A normal resting heart rate is 60 to 100 beats per minute, according to the American Heart Association, or AHA.) “I thought, ‘I’m young. This isn’t that serious,’” Campbell, who was 24 at the time, says. But the staff at urgent care felt otherwise and instructed her to go to the hospital.

Once at the hospital, a medical team whisked Campbell by wheelchair to a back room. In a flurry, Campbell was connected to cardiac monitors and given medication to slow her heart rate.

Doctors told Campbell she had supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), a condition in which electrical signals involving the heart’s upper chambers fire abnormally, causing a fast heart rate. Campbell took in this news, and carried on with her life not thinking much of it. But the following year, Campbell met with her cardiologist and learned she had dilated cardiomyopathy, a disease of the heart’s ventricles and atria, the lower and upper chambers of the heart, respectively. That’s when she realized that she had heart disease.

Dilated cardiomyopathy is a heart condition that affects as many as one in 2500 Americans, according to the AHA. The disease is three times more common in Black Americans, compared with white Americans. It often involves the left ventricle, the heart's main pumping chamber, where the heart muscle begins to stretch and becomes thinner, notes the AHA. Consequently, the inside of the chamber enlarges. Doctors might not notice the condition until it impairs the pumping function of the heart. It’s the most common cause of heart failure.

A Family History of Heart Disease Emerges

When Campbell was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy, her doctor ordered genetic testing to see if she had an inherited form of the disorder. Her tests came back negative, which was reassuring.

Meanwhile, Campbell began taking medications to improve her heart function and reduce her blood pressure. Over the next several years, however, Campbell had two more SVT episodes, which resulted in a diagnosis of congestive heart failure. More medications and higher doses of her current medications were added to her treatment plan.

Because Campbell’s heart condition could lead to cardiac arrest and death, her doctor also recommended an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) at that time. But the thought of wearing an implantable device seemed overwhelming, so Campbell decided against it.

It wasn’t until her sister, Shemia, passed away at age 31 a year later from several contributing health factors, including heart disease, that Campbell decided to get the implant.

After Shemia’s death, Campbell started asking her family about heart disease. Even though her mother and father were heart disease–free, she discovered that her great grandmother, grandmother, and several aunts had heart conditions.

Having a family history of premature heart disease is common. According to a study published in the Journal of the American Heart Association in July 2019, it’s estimated that 27.8 million people over 20 in the United States who are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease can be identified by family history.

“Knowing your family medical history is really important for all diseases,” says Jennifer Mieres, MD, professor of cardiology at the Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra Northwell in Hempstead, New York, and coauthor of Heart Smart for Women. “Family history is a key component that can help you plan to manage your future health. Everyone, as part of their partnership with their medical team, needs to discuss their family medical history with their doctor.”

In addition to family history, Dr. Mieres also stresses the importance of being aware of other risk factors for heart disease, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and being a smoker. Half of all American have at least one of these three big risk factors for heart disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

“All told, heart disease should be a concern for everyone, even if you have a clean family history of it,” Mieres says.

How an ICD Saved Campbell’s Life

Although heart disease was still on Campbell’s radar, she didn’t think much of it after her ICD. “I was more stress free because I wasn’t worried, knowing I had the ICD,” she says. “Life was normal.” But three years later, in June 2021, Campbell was home at the time and remembers feeling dizzy and lightheaded. “The next thing I knew, I was getting up off the floor,” she says. Campbell drove to the hospital emergency department, where she learned her heart had gone into ventricular fibrillation (vfib). This life-threatening heart rhythm abnormality can cause cardiac arrest and is very serious, according to the AHA. With vfib, the heart’s lower chambers quiver instead of contract normally, leading to cardiac arrest.

“My ICD shocked me and brought my heart back into its regular rhythm,” Campbell says.

This year, Campbell, 34, was named a national ambassador for the American Heart Association’s Go Red for Women campaign. Together with a team of women with cardiac-related issues, Campbell works to raise awareness of heart disease by sharing her story.

The former 911 operator also recently turned a stress relieving hobby — baking decorative cookies — into an entrepreneurial venture. She’s Happy Treats is an online and storefront bakery that Campbell operates from her hometown in Milwaukee, where she specializes in decorative cookies for all occasions.

Campbell says that she is living a full life today, and encourages others facing health challenges to do the same. “Don’t think it’s the end of the world just because you have an illness,” she says. “It's one more reason why you should put more effort into living.”","That’s when she realized that she had heart disease.

In 2022, 373 people were, including 32 infected with bacteria that were resistant to the five antibiotics commonly used against shigella, said Rachel Jervis, manager of the foodborne, enteric and waterborne diseases program at the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.

There’s likely some underreporting, though people are more likely to seek care for shigellosis than for other infections, given its relatively long course and that it’s not uncommon to see bleeding, she said.

Shigellosis causes prolonged diarrhea, abdominal cramping and fever. Most people recover without any specific treatment, or with intravenous fluids to prevent dehydration. People who have compromised immune systems or who are older have a higher risk of severe illness, though, and antibiotics may be necessary for them, Jervis said.

“Having drug-resistant shigella means doctors have fewer tools in their toolbox,” she said.

Nationwide, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 239 people have been infected with extensively drug-resistant, or XDR, shigella strains since 2015, with 90% of those cases reported between 2020 and 2022. Data from the current year isn’t available yet.

Colorado had the second-highest total, behind California, with the 32 recorded in 2022 and four in previous years. The state’s public health lab sequences every shigella case for antibiotic resistance, while some states only test a portion of the samples they receive, Jervis said.

“What we have is real and it’s happening, but it’s difficult to compare to what’s happening in other states,” she said.

Right now, there’s no protocol for treating people who become severely ill with the most drug-resistant strain, according to the CDC. Two types of antibiotics are available in the United States and might work, but haven’t been extensively studied against XDR shigella.

The CDC also raised concerns that the drug-resistant shigella could swap genes with bacteria that have a higher fatality rate, so that antibiotics no longer work against the illnesses they cause.

The United States sees about 450,000 shigella infections and 5,400 hospitalizations in a typical year, according to CDC estimates. Shigellosis is most common in children under 5, but kids accounted for only about 5% of XDR infections. Most of the resistant infections were in adult men who have sex with men, people with HIV, those who recently traveled overseas and people who are homeless.

The bacteria is spread when trace amounts of feces get into the mouth, Jervis said. That can happen when people touch an infected person’s hands, if not thoroughly washed, and then eat or touch their mouths; by touching objects an infected person touched; by changing diapers or providing toileting assistance to an infected person; by eating food prepared by someone who was sick; by swimming in water after an infected person did; and by sexual contact.

In some cases, the state was able to find a specific mode of transmission, including sex, but in others, there were too many possibilities, she said.

“When people are sexual partners, they’re sharing a lot of other contact,” she said.

The CDC recommends that people who had any strain of shigella abstain from sex, not prepare food for others and avoid water recreation for two weeks after their diarrhea stops. It also advises them to use condoms or another barrier method and to carefully wash body parts and intimate toys after resuming sex.

In August, the state’s public health lab found four shigella cases that were nearly identical genetically, all in men in the Denver area, Jervis said on a CDC-hosted call to educate health care providers in February. Bacteria pick up mutations over time, so when their genetic material is highly similar, that suggests people were infected in the same event, or that one of the people infected the others.

The CDC reported the Colorado cases were part of a multi-state outbreak in early September. Altogether, the state found 17 cases linked to the cluster in people who were infected between July and December, Jervis said. Eight people were hospitalized, but no one died.

Of those 17 people, 11 lived in Denver, with the others spread along the Front Range. Fourteen were men, and 10 reported they had male sexual partners. They also were more likely to report being homeless, using multiple substances and having compromised immune systems than the general population.

In October, the state health department sent a notice to providers advising them to request testing to find out if their patients’ shigella infection is still susceptible to antibiotics. It also reminded them that they’re required to report shigella cases and that juvenile patients shouldn’t return to school or child care until cleared by public health officials. Whether adults can return to work depends on their job, with people working in food service or health care needing to stay home longer.

So far this year, there are fewer shigellosis cases, but it’s not clear how much of that is due to the disease’s tendency to peak in the summer, Jervis said. People who have persistent diarrhea should get tested, so they know if they need to take additional precautions to avoid infecting others, she said.

“It’s really important to seek medical care if your symptoms aren’t resolving,” she said.

In new satellite imagery obtained by CBS News, the yacht can be seen docked in a port in Kaliningrad, near Russia's nuclear weapons operations.

Experts say Putin's luxury vessel has become a symbol not only of his vast hidden wealth, but also of how challenging that money has been to find.

""He's a KGB agent, so he's crafty. He knows how to hide when he needs to,"" said John Smith, former director of the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, which administers and enforces all foreign sanctions.

Putin's purported yacht ""Graceful"" docked in Kaliningrad, Russia. Satellite image ©2022 Maxar Technologies.

Data from MarineTraffic, a global intelligence group, shows Putin's alleged yacht, the Graceful, left Germany two weeks before the invasion of Ukraine.

Putin's government salary is said to be about $140,000, but that doesn't begin to explain the mansions, million-dollar watch collection and over-the-top yacht.

""It would be fair to say he's among the richest men in the world,"" Smith said.

Though he sells himself as a man of the people, his wealth is estimated to be more than $100 billion.

Putin's critics allege he also has a cliffside palace that includes an amphitheater and a personal tunnel to the beach that doubles as a security bunker.

""Of course, he doesn't acknowledge it as being his own,"" Smith said. ""It doesn't fit with the public persona that he's trying to create to actually acknowledge it.""

Putin relies on his oligarch friends to shield his fortune from sanctions, Smith said.

""So if he asked them to do something, they do it in terms of hiding assets, squirreling them in different parts of the globe, they will do what he needs,"" he said.

Those who have tried to expose Putin's fortune have done so at great personal risk.

Putin critic Boris Nemtsov was assassinated on a bridge in the shadow of the Kremlin in 2015. Sergei Magnitsky died in 2009 under questionable circumstances in prison after he exposed $230 million in fraud by Putin's friends. Putin publicly condemned Nemtsov's murder and claimed Magnitsky died of a heart attack.

His most recent No. 1 critic, Alexei Navalny, who helped expose Putin's lavish palace, emerged as a political rival and found himself repeatedly jailed. He nearly died after being poisoned two years ago, though Putin has denied responsibility for the poisoning.

""Putin's wealth is one of the most dangerous topics,"" said Russian journalist Roman Badanin, who spent two decades investigating Putin's financial web.

Badanin said Russian authorities sought to intimidate and silence his reporting team. Six months ago, he reached his breaking point.

""I fled the country. My apartment was searched twice. I have like three criminal charges against me back in Russia,"" he said.

In his State of the Union address, President Biden said the U.S. and its allies are waging economic war on Putin and Russian oligarchs.

""We are joining with our European allies to find and seize your yachts, your luxury apartments and your private jets,"" Biden said.

On Wednesday, the Justice Department announced the formation of a new task force that would target Russian oligarchs.

""Russia is not a transparent economy,"" Smith said. ""The U.S. and our allies have decent information on some of [Putin's] assets, I think a lot will remain a mystery for a long time in the future.""

The biggest financial hit for Putin would be sanctions on the energy sector, which Smith says the Russian president has used to build up his wealth for years. So far, Washington and the Europeans have been hesitant to do that.","Data from MarineTraffic, a global intelligence group, shows Putin's alleged yacht, the Graceful, left Germany two weeks before the invasion of Ukraine.

NOTICE PAPER 963 OF 2022

FOR WRITTEN ANSWER

Date: For Parliament Sitting on 15 February 2022

Name and Constituency of Member of Parliament

Mr Don Wee, MP, Chua Chu Kang GRC

Question:

To ask the Prime Minister whether MAS has any plans to regulate activities in relation to non-fungible tokens

Answer by Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Senior Minister and Minister in charge of MAS:

1 Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are a form of digital token, where each token has distinct and unique features that are verified and secured by blockchain technology. NFTs are still a relatively new development in the technology space. While NFTs can be used to represent any underlying asset, they have for now been mainly used to tokenise digital art and other collectibles.

2 MAS does not and cannot possibly regulate all things or products that people choose to invest their money in. We consider the substance of an asset when assessing whether a product or activity should come under MAS’ regulatory remit. MAS does not currently regulate NFTs given the nature of their underlying assets, such as the few examples earlier. This is also the stance taken by most other leading jurisdictions.

3 More fundamentally, with regard to digital tokens such as NFTs, MAS takes a tech-neutral stance and “looks through” to the underlying characteristics of the token to determine if it is to be regulated by MAS. Should an NFT have the characteristics of a capital markets product under the Securities and Futures Act (SFA), it will be subject to MAS’ regulatory requirements. For example, should an NFT be structured to represent rights to a portfolio of listed shares, it will like other collective investment schemes be subject to prospectus requirements, licensing and business conduct requirements1.

4 MAS would like to remind consumers that investments in digital tokens, including NFTs, are not suitable for retail investors. We have on several occasions put out advisories urging consumers to exercise extreme caution when investing in them. For NFTs in particular, their perceived uniqueness, combined with speculative demand, has served to inflate prices. This potentially puts investors at risk of outsized losses should speculative fervour abate. Further, there are significant legal complexities and risks involved in NFTs. For example, a holder of an NFT with an underlying asset of a digital image should clarify his right of ownership and the legal framework that governs his rights.

5 MAS continues to monitor developments in the digital token space, including NFTs.

Hazard associated with lice species

Current issues

Lice (Phthiraptera) are a very diverse group of insects, exclusively adapted to parasitism. Several thousand species have been described to date [1]. Their body is flattened dorso-ventrally, they are wingless, relatively small in size (0.4−10 mm in length) and have a hemimetabolic (incomplete metamorphosis) life cycle, comprising adults (males and females), eggs (known as nits) and three nymphal stages [2,3]. Lice generally have a high host-specificity, and within a host species there is sometimes also a specificity to certain body regions. They are widely distributed across the globe. Lice can be divided into two main groups: sucking lice (Anoplura) and chewing lice (Mallophaga). All active stages of lice are parasitic in warm-blooded vertebrates (birds and mammals) [3]. The two groups differ in their feeding habits, with Mallophaga feeding on skin and skin products and Anoplura generally feeding on blood. The groups can be easily differentiated morphologically. Anoplura are an important pest and disease vector affecting both public and veterinary health. Mallophaga are important pest species for animals, but not for humans.

Invasive species/global dispersion

Most lice with public health and veterinary relevance have a global distribution, as they are associated with hosts that are also widely dispersed. Their global distribution is mediated by humans via tourism, transport, and the trade of pets and livestock. A particularly interesting louse is Heterodoxus spiniger which was originally a parasite of marsupials in Australia, later switched to dingoes, and from these moved to domestic dogs. The species is now spread worldwide in various carnivores, including domestic dogs [3].

Ecological plasticity

All active stages of lice are obligatory parasites, but with a relatively high host-specificity.

Biting and disease risk

Only those sucking lice with humans as their host species are of relevance to public health. Apart from causing nuisance, human body lice are also important vectors of diseases.

Anoplura

Anoplura are important parasites of both humans and animals. In humans, louse infestation is known as pediculosis if caused by head or body lice, and as pthiriasis if caused by pubic lice. Pediculosis is a contagious parasitic infestation, transmitted from human-to-human by close contact or, in body lice, via infested clothes or bed linen. The most common louse infestation in humans is pediculosis capitis (caused by Pediculus humanus capitis), particularly affecting school children between three and 11 years, and clinically manifesting as scalp pruritus [4]. It is estimated that head lice infest more than 100 million people worldwide [5]. Pediculosis corporis (caused by Pediculus humanus humanus) is a major public health concern, mainly occurring in crowded human communities, such as refugee camps or shelters for homeless, where hygiene is poor and clothes or linen are not washed regularly [4]. At homeless shelters in Europe, the prevalence of body lice can reach over 20% [6]. The clinical signs of body lice infestation include intense pruritus and cutaneous rash, associated with allergy to the bites. In chronic infestations, the skin becomes thickened [5]. Pubic lice, Pthirus pubis, cause pubic pruritus.

Due to their blood feeding behaviour, body lice can transmit a great variety of diseases, such as epidemic typhus (caused by Rickettsia prowazekii), louse-borne relapsing fever (caused by Borrelia recurrentis), or trench fever (caused by Bartonella quintana) [3]. Head lice and pubic lice are not known as vectors of pathogens, but head lice can be involved in mechanical transmission of opportunistic bacteria.

In animals, the presence of sucking lice can cause irritation through the permanent blood feeding. Salivary components induce severe itching which causes skin lesions due to intensive pruritus. Although the amount of blood consumed by each louse is negligible (less than 0.1 mg/meal), high intensity infestations can induce anaemia, mainly in young animals. Other clinical signs may include one or more of the following: alopecia, squamous dermatitis, skin thickening and more or less severe pruritus. At farms with heavily infested animals economic losses can also be incurred as a result of decreased milk and meat production. Due to the direct contact of salivary antigens with the host’s blood, there is a significant immune response to sucking lice, which protects the host after multiple exposures. This is probably the reason why sucking lice are more common in young animals than in adults, at least as regards domestic animals. Various types of hypersensitivity are also known to occur in sucking lice infestations [2]. In domestic animals, sucking lice can also transmit some diseases (see ‘Epidemiology and transmission of pathogens’).

Mallophaga

There are no Mallophaga species that are known parasites of humans. Moreover, as chewing lice are highly host-specific, the species, which are parasitic for animals, will never infest humans, even temporarily. In animals, most of the cases of chewing lice infestation are asymptomatic as the host has various defence mechanisms. These include grooming, moulting, hair or feather loss. Hibernation and hormonal changes of the host can also reduce the load of chewing lice. In some hosts, lice have their own predators, such as fungi or bacteria. In animals with concurrent conditions (weak, inability to stand up, etc.), lack of grooming is associated with high louse densities. The intensity of infestations may also be high in very young or very old animals [3]. Heavy infestations with chewing lice generally induce itching and pruritus, associated with localised alopecia and excoriations [2]. In heavily infested animals, economic loss can be incurred (e.g. decreased milk production and growth or losses associated with inferior hides in the leather industry). Infested sheep tend to rub against hard surfaces and display significant fleece loss [3]. In dogs and cats, skin debris is visible in the fur and pruritus is common. In guinea pigs, the infestations are common when animals are held in large groups (i.e. in pet shops) and can cause severe stress. In poultry, the symptoms are dependent on the phylogenetic louse group. Most members of Amblycera (a group of chewing lice) are able to destroy the quills of feathers. Members of Ischnocera chew parts of the feathers, causing partial feather damage. As in mammals, chewing lice that infest birds can cause mild to moderate pruritus [2]. Due to intense grooming, lice can indirectly cause digestive problems in the host resulting from the formation of hair balls, mainly in cats and calves [3]. Despite limited contact with the host’s blood, there is evidence suggesting the presence of an immune response to chewing lice. Studies in sheep provide evidence of the presence of specific antibodies, T-cell responses and type I and III hypersensitivity reactions which complicate the skin lesions [2]. Chewing lice do not play an important role in pathogen transmission. However, some species (i.e. the chewing lice of carnivores) act as an intermediate host for Dipylidium caninum which is transmitted to dogs and cats via ingestion. Some chewing lice infesting birds are able to transmit avian filariases [2,3].

Geographical distribution

Brief history of spread and European distribution

All lice are co-distributed with their specific host, meaning that species that are parasitic in domestic animals and humans have a global distribution. Their spread probably occurred simultaneously with the colonisation of continents by early humans and their domesticated animals.

Future expansion

It is unlikely that lice will change their geographical distribution in the future, except in situations when infested domestic animals are introduced into lice-free areas (e.g. remote islands).

Morphological characters and similar species

Anoplura

The sucking lice (Anoplura; Greek: ‘anoplos’ = unarmed; ‘ura’ = tail) are ectoparasites of placental mammals, with a worldwide distribution. As opposed to chewing lice, their main feeding behaviour is hematophagous and, as a result, they induce a different pathology and can be important vectors for several medically important pathogens. Sucking lice are less biodiverse than chewing lice as they currently include around 550 species, grouped into 50 genera and 15 families. Of these, only a few are parasitic in humans and domestic animals (Table 1). Most of the general morphological features of sucking lice are similar to those of chewing lice. A notable difference from chewing lice is that the head of a sucking lice is slender and narrower than the thorax. Sucking lice also lack maxillary palps. The mouthparts are adapted for blood feeding and are only visible during feeding. All three thoracic segments are fused, and the thorax appears as one single segment [3]. The antennae are clearly visible and have three to five segments [2].

There is an ongoing debate on the taxonomic status of the human head louse and body louse. They are currently considered to be two subspecies of the same species. A study on the sequence variation of two intergenic spacers in human head and body lice showed that the two subspecies cannot be genetically differentiated and sequence types vary on a bio-geographical basis [7]. However, regardless of their taxonomic status, it is clear that head lice and body lice are different in terms of their relevance to public health.

Mallophaga

The chewing lice (Mallophaga; Greek: ‘mallos’ = wool; ‘phagein’ = eat) are ectoparasites of birds and mammals (marsupial and placental), with a worldwide distribution. They are quite a biodiverse group, with more than 2 600 known species. No species of chewing lice are known to feed on humans. Most of the species are parasitic in wildlife but several are also known from domestic animals and are divided into two main groups of veterinary importance: Amblycera and Ischnocera (Table 2). In both groups the body is flattened dorso-ventrally and the head is generally wider than the first segment of the thorax. The main difference between the two groups of chewing lice is in the morphology of the antennae (four segments in Amblycera, located in a groove lateral to the head; three-to-five segments in Ischnocera, free from the head and clearly visible) and of the maxillary palps (present in Amblycera, absent in Ischnocera) [2,3]. The thorax is usually segmented into two or three parts. The abdomen (which has 11 segments) is elongated and is protected by sclerotised plates which confer a certain rigidity to the body, even when the abdomen is distended. The adult females possess gonopods on the caudal part of the abdomen and these are used to control and glue the eggs to the hair or feathers of the host [3]. As in other hemimetabolic insects, immature stages (nymphs) resemble adults, but are smaller and lack genital structure.

Development and life cycle

The life cycle of sucking and chewing lice is generally similar. Reproduction is sexual and occurs on the host. However, there are a few species which are parthenogenetic, such as B. bovis. Males usually make up around 1−5% of the total adult population on a host. The female lice lay around 0.2−10 eggs per day, which they glue to the hair or feathers. The eggs of the lice are known as nits. The first nymphal stage emerges following an incubation period of 4−15 days. Each of the three nymphal stages, which have the same feeding behaviour as the adults, develop to the next stage in around three to eight days, separated by moulting. The lifespan of adult lice is around 35 days (Figure 1). Although all lice are permanent parasites, some species of chewing lice can survive off-host for several days [3].

Common signs of drug addiction include:

Struggling to control substance use (amount, length of time using, and frequency)

A desire to quit without being able to follow through

Cravings

Withdrawal

There are many misconceptions surrounding drug addiction and those who struggle with it. It is important to remember that addiction is not a moral failing or due to a lack of willpower or discipline. Addiction is a disease and is not a fault of the person experiencing it. There is help available for those who need it.

Read on to learn more about drug addiction, including how it changes the brain, causes, and how to get help for you or a loved one.

The Disease Model of Addiction

The disease model of addiction uses biological, neurological, and genetic reasoning to explain the development of addictive behaviors. This approach further supports that addiction is a disease of the brain.

That said, the disease model of addiction does have its limitations because of its exclusion of environmental, psychological, and social factors. Drug addiction is a multifaceted illness and multiple angles must be considered when discussing and addressing the condition.

How Does Addiction Change the Brain?

To understand how addiction changes the brain, it is important to know how drugs impact the brain.

Drugs primarily affect what's known as the reward center of the brain. The reward center is made up of various structures and pathways that are activated when you experience something enjoyable or rewarding. The brain releases the neurotransmitter dopamine, a chemical responsible for feelings of pleasure.

Over time, drug addiction can physically alter the brain. In fact, brain imaging studies of people who have substance use disorder show these physical changes in the brain, including structures vital to judgment, decision-making, learning and memory, and behavioral control.

Is Addiction Chronic?

Addiction is defined as a chronic, progressive disease. This means that it is often lifelong and not curable, and a relapse is possible, although many people can go on to manage addiction with proper treatment and support.

Is Addiction a Choice?

The first time trying a substance is a choice, a conscious decision you make. But becoming addicted to the substance is not a choice, it is what happens over time. Drug addiction is not a moral failing or the result of low willpower. Addiction is a disease, and a serious one. Nearly 841,000 people have died since 1999 from a drug overdose.



What Causes Drug Addiction?

Drug addiction is caused by a variety of factors, including someone's genetic makeup, the environment they find themselves in, and developmental experiences. Psychological factors, such as having a mental health illness, also contribute.



Genetics

Genetics plays the largest role in the chance of someone developing a substance use disorder. Genetics accounts for 40%–70% of the risk if a parent or close relative has an addiction.

Environment

In addition to one's genetic makeup, the environment they inhabit can further contribute to the chance they develop a drug addiction. For example, children who grow up around parents or others who struggle with drug addiction are more likely to develop a drug addiction than others without this influence.



Getting Help

Whether you or a loved one is struggling with addiction, there are effective treatment programs such as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and Narcotics Anonymous. Therapy and self-care strategies can also help.

Therapy

Different therapies that may help with addiction include:



Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): Through this form of talk therapy (psychotherapy) a mental health professional will help identify patterns and track thoughts or feelings that may have led to the addiction, and provide step-by-step guidance and healthy coping skills.

Other forms of talk therapy: Psychotherapy uses different types of communication to assess, diagnose, and treat behavior patterns and emotional concerns.



Self-Care Strategies

Taking care of your own emotional, physical, and mental health is important. Try to incorporate the following each day:

Regular exercise

Meditation

Healthy diet

Enough sleep



You're Not Alone If you or a loved one are struggling with substance use or addiction, contact the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helpline at 800-662-4357 for information on support and treatment facilities in your area.

Summary

Drug addiction is a chronic, progressive brain disease. It is caused by a multitude of factors including one's genetics, development, psychology, and environment. There are many effective treatments available including therapy and group programs.

A Word From Verywell

Struggling with drug addiction is not easy. It is not a choice, a moral failing, or the result of a lack of willpower. There is help available. Talk to a loved one or your healthcare provider if you think you may be struggling with drug addiction.

Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disease wherein dopaminergic neurons progressively die in the brainstem. Tremor and difficulties in walking are the most commonly recognizable symptoms for people suffering from Parkinson. Although there is no permanent cure for it, a study from the University of Copenhagen has shown a ray of hope for the treatment of Parkinson's.

The study was published in 'Nature Communications'.

People are primarily treated with medicine, but in some cases, doctors use Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS). In DBS, the surgeon places a thin metal wire in the brain, which can be used to send electrical pulses. DBS is effective in treating tremors, but alleviating difficulties in walking and freezing remain a challenge.

ALSO READ: Heart attack survivors less likely to develop Parkinson's disease: Study

The study, conducted in mice, demonstrate that DBS treatment of walking problems in Parkinson could be optimized by targeting specific neurons in the brainstem - possibly benefiting some of the more than 7 to 10 million people suffering from the disease worldwide.

Based on previous animal studies of motor circuits, which are responsible for the planning, control, and execution of voluntary movements, scientists have hypothesized that freezing of walking in Parkinson could be alleviated. That would require DBS to stimulate neurons in the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN), which is located in the brainstem. The PPN was thought to send signals from the brain to the spinal cord leading to body movements.

Over time, nearly a quarter of the patients have so much trouble walking that they often end up freezing on the spot and falling, and many become housebound.

""However, initial results from clinical trials with DBS of the PPN had very variable effect on movement recovery, particularly in patients who experience freezing of walking. It has therefore been debated where within the brainstem an optimal stimulation should be. Our study brings new knowledge to the table regarding the best area for DBS in order to alleviate this particular symptom,"" said corresponding author Professor Ole Kiehn at the Department of Neuroscience.

Previous results from the group showed that stimulation of so-called excitatory neurons in the PPN could initiate locomotion in normal mice. It raised the possibility that these nerve cells could indeed be used to treat movement symptoms in mice with features of Parkinson's disease.

""We use a technology to target specific group of cells in the PPN in order to close in on what areas are the best to stimulate if we want to alleviate these particular symptoms. The result shows that the motor improvement is optimal if we stimulate what we call excitatory neurons in the caudal area of the PPN,"" explained Ole Kiehn.

""We believe that clinical trials with brainstem DBS are the right strategy to facilitate patients to walk properly again. But the variable clinical results occur because DBS would require higher precision to target the particular group of neurons in the caudal PPN. It is a very delicate area because if we were to stimulate excitatory neurons in other areas than the caudal PPN, it would cause complete immobilization instead.""

In Parkinson's disease, nerve cells that produce dopamine progressively die. Since the 1960s, doctors have relied on medication to replace the missing dopamine, but it is notoriously difficult to fully control symptoms as the disease progresses.

""In many people, the movement symptoms do not respond well to medical treatment in the later stages of this disease, so there has been done a lot of research into alternative treatments, including a search for optimal targets for deep brain stimulation,"" explained Postdoc Debora Masini, first author of the new study, which included several different strategies to substantiate their findings.

""When we stimulated these specific neurons in the caudal area of the PPN, the animals were able to walk normally, across longer distances and with normal walking speed, as opposed to before the stimulation, where they would display symptoms of Parkinson's Disease,"" said Debora Masini.

""We systematically compared stimulation of different locations and cell types in a series of complementary experiments. And they all pointed towards the same conclusion. It strongly indicates these excitatory neurons in the caudal PPN are an ideal target for recovery of movement loss,"" she said.

The researchers hoped that the new study could aid clinicians when they pick the exact location for DBS in the brainstem.

""The mice in our study only partially represent the complexity of this disease, but the results have been very telling. Nearly everything we have learned in the beginning on how to treat Parkinson's Disease comes from animal models, including the medication we use nowadays for patients. In this sense, it is a valid approach, and we hope our study can help provide better treatment for human patients,"" said Debora Masini.","Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disease wherein dopaminergic neurons progressively die in the brainstem.

Scientists are concerned because of the rate of new mosquitoes arriving in Florida and the potential for them to transmit mosquito-borne diseases.

A mosquito known only by its scientific name, Culex lactator, is the latest to establish in the Sunshine State, according to a new study published in the Journal of Medical Entomology by faculty at the UF/IFAS Florida Medical Entomology Laboratory (UF/IFAS FMEL).

This species was first discovered in Miami-Dade County in 2018 by UF/IFAS faculty while they hunted for other nonnative mosquitoes. Since then, thriving populations have been recorded in Miami-Dade, Collier, and Lee counties. Scientists are concerned there hasn’t been enough research on the species and their potential disease risk.

“There are about 90 mosquito species living in Florida, and that list is growing as new mosquito species are introduced to the state from elsewhere in the world,” said Lawrence Reeves, lead author of the study and an assistant professor and mosquito biologist at the UF/IFAS research center in Vero Beach.

Mosquitoes are among the most studied insects because they can transmit diseases. However, there are large gaps of knowledge, said Reeves.

“That’s particularly true for species from the tropical forests, where mosquitoes are diverse and understudied,” he said. “Introductions of new mosquito species like this are concerning because many of our greatest mosquito-related challenges are the result of nonnative mosquitoes, and in a case like this, it’s difficult to anticipate what to expect when we know so little about a mosquito species.”

Globally, there are more than 3,600 types of mosquitoes. When a new mosquito is found in Florida, it could be any of these species. Reeves and his team used DNA analysis and other tools to not only discover they had found a new mosquito species, but to identify it as Culex lactator.

Culex lactator is found in Central America and northern South America and is a member of the Culex group of mosquitoes. This group includes important species that transmit the West Nile and St. Louis encephalitis viruses, but it is unclear whether Culex lactator will contribute to the transmission of these viruses in Florida.

Every year, Florida faces challenges from mosquito-transmitted diseases like West Nile virus, eastern equine encephalitis virus, dengue virus, chikungunya virus and others, explained Reeves.

“It’s too early to know whether Culex lactator will exacerbate these challenges, but the implications are often difficult to predict because not all mosquito species are equally capable of transmitting a particular virus or other pathogen,” said Reeves.

Each mosquito-borne virus is transmitted by only certain mosquito species, said Reeves.

“We need to be vigilant for introductions of new mosquito species because each introduction comes with the possibility that the introduced species will facilitate the transmission of a mosquito-transmitted disease,” he said.

The initial specimens of Culex lactator were collected in 2018 from rural sites in southern Miami-Dade County, south of Florida City, followed by additional adult and immature specimens collected through 2022 in the same locations. Each set of mosquitoes were collected from traps set by associate professor Nathan Burkett-Cadena, doctoral student Kristin Sloyer and Reeves while looking for other recently introduced mosquitoes.

In 2022, scientists with the Collier Mosquito Control District and Lee County Mosquito Control District found Culex lactator in their counties, indicating that Culex lactator has likely spread from its initial point of introduction.

Currently, Culex lactator is known to live in Collier County – south and east of Naples – Lee County, west of Fort Myers, and in the Homestead area of Miami-Dade County, though it may have also spread elsewhere in the state, said Reeves.

“Culex lactator is physically similar to mosquito species already known from Florida. It looks like other more common mosquito species,” said Reeves. “Because of that similarity, the presence of Culex lactator in an area can be easy to miss.”

Reeves and his team stress it’s important to monitor for Culex lactator as it is likely to spread within the state into areas that are environmentally suitable.

Florida’s proximity to the tropics and climate conditions make it ideal for nonnative mosquito species. Scientists are concerned about the rate and frequency of new species establishing in Florida. As many as 17 nonnative mosquito species are established in the state. Researchers stress that the detections of nonnative mosquito species are increasingly frequent, with 11 of 17 nonnative species first reported in the past two decades, and six of these 17 detected in only the past five years, said Reeves.

The mosquitoes Aedes aegypti, Aedes albopictus, and Culex quinquefasciatus – among the most important disease vectors in the United States – like Culex lactator, are nonnative species, introduced from the tropics.

“Climate change may improve the chances of tropical mosquito species becoming established once they make it to Florida if the state becomes warmer,” adds Reeves. “Increasing storm frequency and intensity could also blow in more mosquitoes and other species from the Caribbean, Central America, and elsewhere.

The extent to which these medicines will save lives depends on how widely available and affordable they will be.



The first drug, baricitinib, is strongly recommended for patients with severe or critical COVID-19. It is part of a class of drugs called Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors that suppress the overstimulation of the immune system. WHO recommends that it is given with corticosteroids.



Baricitinib is an oral drug, used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. It provides an alternative to other arthritis drugs called Interleukin-6 receptor blockers, recommended by WHO in July 2021.



WHO has also conditionally recommended the use of a monoclonal antibody drug, sotrovimab, for treating mild or moderate COVID-19 in patients who are at high risk of hospitalization. This includes patients who are older, immunocompromised, having underlying conditions like diabetes, hypertension, and obesity, and those unvaccinated.



Sotrovimab is an alternative to casirivimab-imdevimab, a monoclonal antibody cocktail recommended by WHO in September 2021. Studies are ongoing on the effectiveness of monoclonal antibodies against Omicron but early laboratory studies show that sotrovimab retains its activity.



The panel of experts developing the guidelines also looked at two other drugs for severe and critical COVID-19: ruxolitinib and tofacitinib. Given their uncertain effects, WHO made a conditional recommendation against their use.



Today’s recommendations, forming the eighth update of WHO’s living guidelines on therapeutics and COVID-19, are based on evidence from seven trials involving over 4,000 patients with non-severe, severe, and critical COVID-19.



WHO is in discussions with manufacturers to secure global supply capacity and equitable and sustainable access to the newly recommended therapeutics. The Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator (ACT-A) Therapeutics pillar has been engaging with pharmaceutical companies to seek comprehensive access plans for low- and middle-income countries, so that these treatments can be rapidly deployed everywhere, not just in rich countries. The ACT-A is also looking to expand licensing scope to make the products more affordable.

He was close to safety from the war-torn land. But he decided to turn around.

“I have friends,” he said of his fellow Africans in Ukraine. “If by leaving my valuables, I can save more lives, then I’m doing it. Life is more important.”

Osho, who's from Nigeria, returned to Ternopil, in western Ukraine, where he’s remained in a safe zone for the past week. He's helped shelter people in underground bunkers, driven them to borders and provided money through a fundraiser. In all, he said he and a friend have aided some 200 people.

He said he’s relied heavily on Instagram, where people across the country have reached out to ask for money and transportation.

“I navigate people who don’t know how to get out of the war zone,” he told NBC News, adding that he has helped people reach the Ternopil safe zone, “then to the border. I even buy them train tickets and pay for transportation.”

Organizations like the Lviv Center for Urban History, Fight for Right, BOCTOK-SOS and the Urgent Action Fund for Women’s Human Rights are providing everything from food and transportation to shelter for those fleeing the conflict. And Osho is one of several Africans helping in these rescue efforts, often sharing information online using the hashtags #AfricanInUkraine and #BlackInUkraine. Along with Osho, a trio of women, Korrine Sky, Tokunbo Koiki and Patricia Daley, are among those who have stepped up to help Africans stranded in the country or desperately trying to flee. The women formed Black Women for Black Lives, and provide Africans and Caribbeans in the area with information on the safest routes through areas where they might face discrimination while trying to flee.

Ukraine has become a popular choice for African students, who now account for nearly a quarter of the more than 76,000 foreign students in Ukraine, according to the BBC, which cited government data for its report. While the official count of African and Black people in Ukraine has not been updated in 20 years, Reuters reported that there were more than 16,000 African students in the country, citing figures from the education ministry.

Ukraine is also home to about 20,000 Indian students, who have also reported discrimination and hostility in trying to escape since the invasion, according to the BBC, which referred to government data.

Russia invaded Ukraine more than a week ago, by land, air and sea, following weeks of tension, sending thousands to various borders to evacuate the country. African citizens living in Ukraine have reported incidents of racist discrimination and abuse at the border, which can include beatings, being denied entry to trains or being left stranded in border towns.

“There was a gap in the access Black people and brown people were getting. There was no one offering their homes to Black people, no one offering to pick up the Black individuals,” Daley told NBC News. “There was a tremendous amount of people offering help and support, but I feel like it was limited to Ukrainian nationals alone. And we know what that means. It’s excluding a group of people. There was a need to support Black people because they weren’t getting the support or access. There was a gap and we bridged it.”

Representatives from several African governments — Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya and Gabon — have condemned the reports, and the African Union said earlier this week that it was disturbed by the news. Filippo Grandi, the U.N. high commissioner for refugees, acknowledged at a Tuesday news conference the discrimination some non-Ukrainians had faced at the border. He said that unfair treatment wasn't the result of state policies.

Sky, Koiki and Daley have never met in person, but the network of aid they have set up for Black people in need in Ukraine could reach thousands. The women started the Black in Ukraine group chat on Telegram, a messaging app, which has made it possible for more than 4,500 Black people in the country to communicate and coordinate with one another for such necessities as shelter and transportation. After raising at least $40,000 in a pair of PayPal fundraisers, the group launched a GoFundMe campaign, encouraging people around the world to donate to help Black people still in Ukraine as well as those who have escaped.

Black Women for Black Lives began with Sky, 26, who was a second- year medical student in Dnieper. She, her husband and two others frantically grabbed whatever they could and left to find safety when Russia began its attack on the country. Sky, who is Zimbabwean, described her harrowing journey from Dnieper to her home in England. Sky said that what should have been a nine-hour journey to Lviv to board a train to a border town on the outskirts of Ukraine ended up taking 24 hours because of traffic and Ukrainian officials stopping the group nearly 10 times to check their documents.

The four were initially headed to the Polish border but had heard from peers that Black people at the border village of Medyka had faced severe racism. So Sky and the group decided to seek refuge in Romania, but treatment there was no better. Sky said just before they could cross the border into Romania, she and her fellow Africans were told to leave the line. They were then told to go to a separate line, where she said they stood for at least nine hours.

“It clicked at that point that it was segregation. I realized there was a nonwhite queue and a white queue,” Sky said. “The language is, ‘It’s because you’re not Ukrainian.’ But that basically means, ‘It’s because you’re not white.’ ""

Sky documented her journey on her Twitter feed while sharing information and resources for other Black people in the area. Sky and Daley said taxi drivers would hike prices for those fleeing, charging hundreds for transportation to border towns. During her own journey, Sky launched the group chat and encouraged Black travelers to stay in groups or use the group chat to find a companion in various areas.

Once in Lviv, she increased her efforts and, seeing her tweets, Daley and Koiki decided to join Sky’s efforts. Daley said she was thankful for Sky, who focused on helping Black students even when she was not safe herself. It is this community and group effort that has been key for Black students either fleeing or still in Ukraine.

The three said they have assisted more than 500 people, helping them to locate shelter and accommodations in Ukraine, cross the border safely and find refuge once out of the country.

“We created a document (that) the students were able to refer to, to find where the borders were, which borders were safe,” and at which borders Black people had experienced racism, Daley said. “It became a guide that included a list of accommodations, a list of drivers, contacts for when students were crossing over. We found very quickly that once the students had gotten to the border and crossed over, there was no one there to support them. This guide gave them assistance with that.”

The World Health Organization maintains that BA.2 is not a ""variant of concern,"" meaning there is no current evidence to suggest this new subvariant will worsen COVID-19 transmission, illness severity, or efficacy of vaccines and public health efforts like masking and social distancing.

BA.2 numbers around the world are rising, with at least 40 countries reporting cases to a global variant tracking database, but the subvariant has spread rapidly in Denmark and the UK, with almost half of recent cases in Denmark attributed to BA.2.

The subvariant has already been detected in several U.S. states, with Washington State confirming two cases Monday.

While over 8,000 BA.2 cases have been identified since November 2021, it is unclear where BA.2 originated. Even though the first sequences were submitted from the Philippines, numerous cases have since been detected in various places, from Europe to South Asia.

Given the rising numbers, health care organizations, like the WHO, are asking scientists to watch and study the new subvariant separately from omicron, to see if it behaves differently.

""It is the nature of viruses to evolve and mutate, so it's to be expected that we will continue to see new variants emerge as the pandemic goes on,"" said Dr. Meera Chand, the COVID-19 incident director at the UK Health Security Agency, in prepared remarks. ""So far, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether BA.2 causes more severe illness than Omicron BA.1, but data is limited.""

The evolution of COVID-19 subvariants is not new. The delta variant also had several subvariants, but scientists referred to all of them as delta. BA.2, however, has earned its own designation due to rising numbers across several nations.

Although it's been called the ""stealth"" omicron variant, the new subvariant, ""can absolutely be detected through traditional surveillance mechanisms whether through rapid testing or PCR,"" said Dr. John Brownstein, chief innovation officer at Harvard University's Boston Children's Hospital and ABC Medical Correspondent.

Conventional COVID-19 tests can show a positive or a negative result, but they can't determine specific variants. For that, scientists need to do additional genetic sequencing. Conveniently, the omicron variant has a particular genetic signature that allows scientists to quickly and easily determine if the sample is omicron or not.

The new BA.2 subvariant does not have that feature, meaning scientists can no longer use this shortcut -- though they can still identify the subvariant using genetic sequencing technology. Because of this, the BA.2 subvariant has sometimes been referred to as the ""stealth"" variant. But for the general public, conventional COVID-19 tests will still work to detect the new subvariant.

Ultimately, while scientists and public health officials are urging continued research and surveillance, experts say there is little reason to worry.

""BA.2 is important from a public health perspective, but it doesn't fundamentally change at this moment, how we think about the impact in the population,"" Brownstein said. ""A lot more work needs to be done to understand severity, breakthrough infections, and immunizations before you can make any statement about clinical relevance.""

""While it's important to understand that in the family of omicron, there is a sub-lineage that is potentially more transmissible, it's not necessarily a cause for panic,"" Brownstein added.

After 106 years, scientists announced last week that the vessel had finally been found.

A team of undersea explorers located the wreck roughly 10,000 feet deep at the bottom of the icy Weddell Sea, just east of the Antarctic Peninsula. As soon as the ships’ rediscovery was announced, scientists jumped at the opportunity to see what life forms have made their home on Endurance.

“The ship is cool, but look at those things living on it,” says Huw Griffiths, a marine biogeographer at the British Antarctic Survey, who was not part of the discovery expedition, to Vox’s Benji Jones.

Undersea cameras revealed the ship’s diverse collection of sea life, including sea stars, sponges, anemones, and sea squirts. Scientists also spotted a deep-sea squat lobster, which has never before been recorded in the area, per Jonathan Amos for BBC.

The 144-foot wooden ship was last seen in 1915 when Shackleton, an Irish-British explorer, was on his quest to reach the South Pole. After Endurance became trapped by sea ice, Shackleton and his team of more than two dozen men waited ten months for the ice the thaw. In the spring, the moving blocks of ice crushed the ship, which then slipped below the surface. Shackleton and his crew were then forced to travel in small boats for an 800-mile journey across the Southern Ocean to the island of South Georgia. All of the crew survived the harrowing expedition.

Despite its age, the sunken vessel has remained in near-pristine condition. The ship provides a rare opportunity to study sea creatures that make their home on hard surfaces. Because the wreck is protected under the terms of the Antarctic Treaty, it is a historic monument.

“There’s been lots of work in the Weddell Sea but mostly on soft bottoms,” says Louise Allcock, a zoologist at the National University of Ireland Galway, to Sabrina Imbler the New York Times. “There is a chance there are new species, if only because of a lack of looking.”

Because no sunlight can reach Endurance's depth, most of the creatures living on and around the ship are filter feeders like sponges and sea stars, which pull edible particles out of the ocean. The footage also revealed a ghostly-white animal that scientists believe is a deep-sea squat lobster. The crab-like animal could be from the genus Munidopsis, which is known to have over 200 species, Griffiths told BBC. A fossil of one species was found on the western side of the Antarctic Peninsula in 2006, but this specimen would be a first for eastern region of the peninsula, Griffiths notes.

In the footage, Griffiths points out stalked animals that are probably glass sponges, and a bright yellow sea-lily, a stalked type of crinoid. Another star of the show was a large white anemone perched behind the wheel of Endurance, looking ready to captain the ship.

“The old crew got off alive, and this is who’s moved in,” Griffiths says to the Times. “Who knows where that sea anemone is taking it?”","During Ernest Shackleton's 1915 Antarctic expedition, his ship Endurance was crushed by ice.

Since the escalation of aggression towards Ukraine that started on 24 February 2022, and as of 7 March 2022, over 1.7 million people have fled to Poland, Hungary, Moldova, Romania, and Slovakia, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR).

Countries hosting displaced populations should ensure that those arriving from Ukraine due to the crisis have access to healthcare services in a similar manner as the local population. This will address continuity of care and prevention of complications due to medical preconditions and will aid early treatment of acute conditions. Additionally, it will help in the early detection of diseases that may cause outbreaks.

This should be an integral part of the overall provision of healthcare to those fleeing Ukraine, as should the diagnosis and treatment of chronic disease and mental and psychosiocal health.

Many of the people currently fleeing Ukraine are expected to not be fully vaccinated against COVID-19. In addition, uptake for childhood vaccinations is reportedly suboptimal in Ukraine.

Ensuring continuity of routine vaccinations and addressing gaps in prior vaccination histories is an essential element of public health support for displaced people. In this context, ensuring vaccination coverage against poliomyelitis, measles and COVID-19 should be a priority.

In addition, ECDC recommends that public health authorities in receiving countries increase awareness so their community healthcare providers can detect and report infectious diseases, including those previously mentioned. This should be an integral part of the overall provision of healthcare to the population fleeing the crisis while facilitating the public health response.

Receiving countries should consider enhancing surveillance for vaccine-preventable and other communicable diseases. Furthermore, it is important to consider establishing syndromic surveillance systems within reception centres and, if possible, in the community.

Healthcare providers should be aware that multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) are frequently connected to war wounds and require early diagnosis and treatment.

This operational document focuses on the infectious disease vulnerabilities of those fleeing Ukraine and the associated requirements for infection prevention and control. However, infectious diseases are just some of the risks to the health and well-being of the displaced people and the measures described in ECDC’s document should be part of a generalised health approach in support of those who have been displaced.

In addressing the challenges posed by those arriving from Ukraine, ECDC is engaged in bilateral and multilateral dialogues with concerned countries as well as EU and international bodies to regularly assess needs, plan and implement specific ECDC support.","ECDC published Operational Considerations for the prevention and control of infectious diseases in the context of Russia’s aggression towards Ukraine on 8 March.

Coronation Street is working closely with the MND Association on this storyline which will explore the challenges faced by Paul and those around him in the coming months, the LiverpoolEcho reports.

What is motor neurone disease (MND)?

Motor neurone disease is an uncommon condition that affects the brain and nerves, according to the NHS. It causes weakness and gets worse over time. There is currently no cure for the disease but treatments that make living with the condition easier are available.

Some people with MND live with it for many years but it can significantly shorten life expectancy and sadly leads to death. It usually affects people in their 60s and 70s but can affect adults of all ages.

It is caused by a problem with cells in the brain and nerves, called motor neurones. The cells gradually stop working over time and it is not known why this happens. Moving around, swallowing and breathing get increasingly difficult for people with MND and some need feeding tubes or air through a face mask.

Having a relative with MND can sometimes mean a person is more likely to get it, a relative with a related condition called frontotemporal dementia may also increase the likelihood of getting MND, however it does not run in families in most cases.

What are the symptoms of MND?

You may not notice the symptoms of MND at first and they tend to develop gradually. Early symptoms can include:

weakness in your ankle or leg – you might trip, or find it harder to climb stairs

slurred speech, which may develop into difficulty swallowing some foods

a weak grip – you might drop things, or find it hard to open jars or do up buttons

muscle cramps and twitches

weight loss – your arms or leg muscles may have become thinner over time

difficulty stopping yourself from crying or laughing in inappropriate situations

It can be difficult to diagnose in the early stages and several other conditions can cause the same symptoms. Tests to rule out other causes include blood tests, brain and spin scans, tests to measure the electrical activity in your muscles and nerves and also a lumbar puncture (spinal tap).

What are the treatments?

There is no cure, but treatments include:

highly specialised clinics, typically involving a specialist nurse and occupational therapy to help make everyday tasks easier

physiotherapy and exercises to maintain strength and reduce stiffness

advice from a speech and language therapist

advice from a dietitian about diet and eating

a medicine called riluzole that can slightly slow down the progression of the condition

medicines to relieve muscle stiffness and help with saliva problems

emotional support for you and your carer

282,282,https://scitechdaily.com/eating-vegetables-does-not-protect-against-heart-disease/,Eating Vegetables Does NOT Protect Against Heart Disease,"Large-scale study finds that eating vegetables does not protect against cardiovascular disease.

Previous positive studies may not have sufficiently corrected for confounding socioeconomic and lifestyle factors, suggests new analysis.

A sufficient intake of vegetables is important for maintaining a balanced diet and avoiding a wide range of diseases. But might a diet rich in vegetables also lower the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD)? Unfortunately, researchers from the Nuffield Department of Population Health at the University of Oxford, the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and the University of Bristol found no evidence for this.

That the consumption of vegetables might lower the risk of CVD might at first sight seem plausible, as their ingredients such as carotenoids and alpha-tocopherol have properties that could protect against CVD. But so far, the evidence from previous studies for an overall effect of vegetable consumption on CVD has been inconsistent.

Now, new results from a powerful, large-scale new study in Frontiers in Nutrition shows that a higher consumption of cooked or uncooked vegetables is unlikely to affect the risk of CVD. They also explain how confounding factors might have explained previous spurious, positive findings.

“The UK Biobank is a large-scale prospective study on how genetics and environment contribute to the development of the most common and life-threatening diseases. Here we make use of the UK Biobank’s large sample size, long-term follow-up, and detailed information on social and lifestyle factors, to assess reliably the association of vegetable intake with the risk of subsequent CVD,” said Prof Naomi Allen, UK Biobank’s chief scientist and co-author on the study.

The UK Biobank, follows the health half a million adults in the UK by linking to their healthcare records. Upon their enrollment in 2006-2010, these volunteers were interviewed about their diet, lifestyle, medical and reproductive history, and other factors.

The researchers used the responses at enrollment of 399,586 participants (of whom 4.5% went on to develop CVD) to questions about their daily average consumption of uncooked versus cooked vegetables. They analyzed the association with the risk of hospitalization or death from myocardial infarction, stroke, or major CVD. They controlled for a wide range of possible confounding factors, including socioeconomic status, physical activity, and other dietary factors.

Crucially, the researchers also assessed the potential role of ‘residual confounding’, that is, whether unknown additional factors or inaccurate measurement of known factors might lead to a spurious statistical association between CVD risk and vegetable consumption.

The mean daily intake of total vegetables, raw vegetables, and cooked vegetables was 5.0, 2.3, and 2.8 heaped tablespoons per person. The risk of dying from CVD was about 15% lower for those with the highest intake compared to the lowest vegetable intake. However, this apparent effect was substantially weakened when possible socio-economic, nutritional, and health- and medicine-related confounding factors were taken into account. Controlling for these factors reduced the predictive statistical power of vegetable intake on CVD by over 80%, suggesting that more precise measures of these confounders would have completed explained any residual effect of vegetable intake.

Dr. Qi Feng, a researcher at the Nuffield Department of Population Health at the University of Oxford, and the study’s lead author, said: “Our large study did not find evidence for a protective effect of vegetable intake on the occurrence of CVD. Instead, our analyses show that the seemingly protective effect of vegetable intake against CVD risk is very likely to be accounted for by bias from residual confounding factors, related to differences in socioeconomic situation and lifestyle.”

Feng et al. suggest that future studies should further assess whether particular types of vegetables or their method of preparation might affect the risk of CVD.

Last author Dr. Ben Lacey, Associate Professor in the department at the University of Oxford, concluded: “This is an important study with implications for understanding the dietary causes of CVD and the burden of CVD normally attributed to low vegetable intake. However, eating a balanced diet and maintaining a healthy weight remains an important part of maintaining good health and reducing risk of major diseases, including some cancers. It is widely recommended that at least five portions of a variety of fruits and vegetables should be eaten every day.”

283,283,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/how-does-caffeine-reduce-heart-disease-risk,Caffeine and heart disease: What is the link?,"Share on Pinterest Scientists are beginning to understand why caffeine protects against heart disease. Roland Beerli/Getty Images A recent study uncovered how caffeine reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease.

Researchers found that caffeine lowers blood proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) levels, which, in turn, lowers “bad” cholesterol, or low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol.

High levels of LDL cholesterol contribute to the development of coronary heart disease.

Researchers are developing new caffeine derivatives as potential therapies to treat cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular disease, also known as heart disease , affects the body’s heart and blood vessels. An estimated 18.2 million adults aged 20 years and older have coronary artery disease in the United States. About 361,000 people in the U.S. died in 2019 from coronary heart disease, with 20% of deaths occurring in adults under 65 years. Coronary heart disease occurs when fatty deposits or plaques consisting of cholesterol, calcium, and fibrin — a substance that causes blood clotting — accumulate in blood vessels. Plaque buildup, or atherosclerosis, in arteries causes narrowing, which may cause a partial or total blockage, leading to heart attack, stroke, or tissue death in the extremities, which people know as gangrene. Scientists currently believe that high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking, and high cholesterol may cause damage to the arteries’ inner lining. Elevated LDL cholesterol levels contribute to atherosclerosis, while high levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), or “good” cholesterol, may be protective. HDL carries LDL away from the arteries, transporting it from the blood to the liver, where the LDL cholesterol is broken down and eliminated from the body. High LDL or low HDL levels alongside elevated triglycerides — the most common type of fat in the body that stores excess energy — increase the risk for heart attack and stroke risk.

Cholesterol regulation Sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2) regulates LDL cholesterol levels in the body. When cholesterol and calcium levels in a cell decrease, it activates SREBP2. This protein then moves to the cell nucleus and activates genes that influence cholesterol production. These gene regulators of cholesterol production include: 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme-A (HMG-CoA) reductase , which controls the rate of cholesterol production

, which controls the rate of cholesterol production LDL receptors , which transport LDL cholesterol from the blood into cells

, which transport LDL cholesterol from the blood into cells PCSK9, which controls the number of LDLRs Dr. Robert Greenfield, MD, an Emeritus Lipid Consultant at MemorialCare Heart & Vascular Institute at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA, spoke with Medical News Today. He explained that PCSK9 protects the liver from getting too much cholesterol. “The liver has the ability to create receptors on its surface — let’s call them ‘parking spots’ for LDL or ‘bad’ cholesterol.” He continued, “When an LDL molecule decides to park in the parking spot, the liver is then able to absorb that cholesterol […] into the liver cell to make bile, vitamin D, and other substances. To avoid too much LDL from entering the liver, and too many parking spots being available, it also manufactures this molecule called PCSK9.” Dr. Greenfield added, “PCSK9 goes out to the parking spots or LDLRs that are on the surface of the liver, and actually [destroys] them, so the amount of LDLRs are kept in check.”

Current cholesterol treatments Medical professionals treat high cholesterol with lifestyle changes, such as a nutritious diet and exercise alone or in combination with medications . These medications reduce high cholesterol through various mechanisms. Statins are the gold standard of treatment and block cholesterol production in the liver by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase. Other medication classes are available to treat high cholesterol in those who do not respond to statins or have intolerable side effects. These other drugs include: adenosine triphosphate-citrate lyase inhibitors , which block the production of cholesterol

, which block the production of cholesterol bile acid sequestrants, which increase the elimination of cholesterol from the intestine

ezetimibe, which limits cholesterol absorption in the intestine

niacin , which decreases the production of cholesterol in the liver

, which decreases the production of cholesterol in the liver fibrates and omega-3 fatty acid ethyl esters, which lower triglycerides

PCSK9 inhibitors, which block the PCSK9 protein Dr. Matthew J. Budoff, a professor of medicine and program director of cardiac computed tomography at David Geffen School of Medicine at University of California, Los Angeles, in an American Journal of Managed Care Peer Exchange, explains: “PCSK9 is a protein developed in the liver. It ‘kills’ the LDL receptors on the liver. […] The LDL floats in our bloodstream [and] does not get taken up by the liver, [which causes] our LDL levels to stay elevated.” He adds, “If you block PCSK9, […] we lower that protein [and] end up with many more LDL receptors, and the liver can then lower LDL. It’s pretty remarkable and consistent that the PCSK9 inhibitors lower LDL by an additional 50% to 60% LDL.” Statins lower LDL to a lesser degree, by about 30–50%. However, PCSK9 inhibitors are injectable medications that are expensive. Despite the availability of different treatment options, some people have difficulties reaching cholesterol goals because of side effects or the lack of access due to medication costs. Therefore, finding new, more cost-effective ways to influence cholesterol levels is an urgent necessity.","Share on Pinterest Scientists are beginning to understand why caffeine protects against heart disease.

However, next generation technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), cryptocurrencies, and the metaverse (virtual or semi-virtual worlds) are already creating a new set of challenges for societies as well as new opportunities to connect, inform, and entertain.

After a period where digital advertising revenue has leaked away to giant platforms, publishers have an opportunity to secure better results this year. Tighter privacy rules limiting third-party data, along with concerns about misinformation, have already started to swing the tide back towards trusted brands, but advertising remains a competitive and challenging business, and not every publisher will thrive.

On the business side, many traditional news organisations remain relentlessly focused on faster digital transformation as rising newsprint and energy costs look to make print unsustainable in some countries. Charging for online news is the end-destination for many, but expect subscription fatigue to limit progress, especially if economic conditions worsen.

Generational change will also continue to be a key theme, leading to more internal soul-searching in newsrooms over diversity and inclusion, about emerging agendas such as climate change and mental health, and about how journalists should behave in social media.

In many parts of the world, audiences for news media have been falling throughout 2021 – not an ideal situation at a time when accurate and reliable information has been so critical to people’s health and security. A key challenge for the news media this year is to re-engage those who have turned away from news – as well as to build deeper relationships with more regular news consumers.

2022 will be a year of careful consolidation for a news industry that has been both disrupted and galvanised by the drawn-out COVID-19 crisis. Both journalists and audiences have, to some degree, been ‘burnt out’ by the relentless intensity of the news agenda, alongside increasingly polarised debates about politics, identity, and culture. This could be the year when journalism takes a breath, focuses on the basics, and comes back stronger.

1. The business of journalism is looking up for some

One of the biggest surprises in this year’s survey is the growth in revenue reported by many publishers. Well over half our sample (59%), which includes both subscription and advertising focused publishers from more than 50 countries, say that overall revenues have increased, with only 8% reporting that things had got worse. This is despite the continuing COVID-19 pandemic and the further erosion of traditional revenue sources such as print.

In many ways this is testament to the adaptability of an industry that has accelerated new digital revenue streams such as subscription, e-commerce, and digital events over the past 18 months – and also started to bring in substantial licensing revenue from tech platforms on top. For all publishers, a key element in this has been a strong bounce back in digital advertising, as consumers moved their spending online during the ongoing pandemic. Digital advertising grew at its fastest rate ever (30% year on year) in 2021 according to GroupM and now accounts for around two-thirds (64%) of all advertising spend.

It is worth remembering that many publishers not represented in our survey still rely on traditional and declining revenue sources such as print and even broadcast. And for those without a clear digital path ahead of them, the outlook remains extremely challenging.

At the same time, overall consumption of online news has fallen significantly in some countries, including the UK and the United States, following the dramas of the Trump era, according to industry data. The relentless and depressing nature of the news has been a factor, with many consumers looking to social media and streaming services for entertainment and distraction.

In our own survey, covering a wide range of countries, we find a more mixed picture. Although the majority (54%) report static or declining traffic to online news sites, more than four in ten (44%) say their traffic has gone up.

Overall, the majority of publishers (73%) say are optimistic about the year ahead. Even if traffic is down in some cases, journalists feel that their role is more valued by audiences and the business side in particular is on a more solid footing.

Journalism is no longer being taken for granted. The industry is explaining itself better and money is flowing proportionately to economic growth.

David Walmsley, Editor-in-Chief, Globe and Mail , Canada

Levels of confidence in journalism more generally (60%) are a bit lower, especially in countries where there is political polarisation, economic weakness, and where journalists themselves are under attack:

The power of governments against free press or journalism is growing in Latin America (especially Mexico). The president can say whatever, even if he is openly lying, press debunking or explaining the lie has little effect [by comparison].



Senior journalist, Mexico

We’ll come back to the pressures on journalists later in this report.

1.1 Subscription and membership models mature

A key part of publisher confidence has been the continued growth of subscription and membership models through the COVID-19 pandemic. The New York Times now has 8.4 million subscriptions, of which 7.6 million are digital, putting it on track to hit its 10 million target by 2025.For many of these early-movers, digital revenue now outstrips print and many upmarket titles can see a path to a sustainable future. But so too can a number of smaller digital-born publishers with significant reader revenues, such as Dennik N in Slovakia, El Diario in Spain, Malaysiakini in Malaysia, Zetland in Denmark, and the Daily Maverick in South Africa.

The opportunity for growth at the company level is there for us. We see the path and prospects clearly now with sustainable revenue model in place.

Styli Charalambous, CEO, Daily Maverick, South Africa

Subscription remains the number one priority (79%) for commercial publishers in 2022, according to our survey, ahead of display advertising (73%) and native advertising (59%), events (40%) and funding from platforms (29%), which has grown significantly over the last year.

The jury is still out on whether subscription models will work for all. Alternatives are being pursued by publications such as BuzzFeed and Vox, working across a range of brands to give them more scale. These brands still see a future with a mix of models – from advertising, to e-commerce, and even reader payment too. Once again, our survey shows there is no one-size-fits-all model. Advertising continues to be the main focus for many, and commercial publishers cite, on average, three or four different revenue streams as being important or very important to them this year.

Free at the point of consumption models will also be important in ensuring that news is not just for elites. Almost half of news leaders (47%) worry that subscription models may be pushing journalism towards super-serving richer and more educated audiences and leaving others behind. Many leaders of PSBs and others committed to open journalism are amongst those who disagree with this statement, but our own research shows that even these organisations are struggling to build connections with younger and less educated groups online.

What will happen this year?

Open access initiatives: Expect more deals for those from disadvantaged backgrounds as a way of countering critiques about growing information inequality. The Daily Maverick in South Africa offers a ‘pay what you can afford’ membership and El Diario in Spain allows people to pay nothing at all. In Portugal, lottery funding has been used to fund 20,000 free digital news subscriptions for eight media outlets. The weekly magazine Visão gave some of these funded free subscriptions to older people attending the University of the 3rd Age while Público targeted unemployed people as part of its allocation, and Correio da Manhã decided to help older people living in care homes. Others, like Politiken in Denmark, are looking to extend schemes offering free access for students to educational institutions.

Countering subscription fatigue via product extensions and bundling: This will be a key focus for many publishers looking to hang on to new subscribers gained during COVID. Cut-price offers and differential pricing will be one likely response, especially if the economy cuts up rough, but others are looking to develop new premium products to encourage tie-in. The New York Times has led the field with the success of its crosswords and cooking apps. Now it has moved its product review site, Wirecutter, behind a paywall and has also started offering previously free newsletters from star writers like Kara Swisher only to subscribers. Other publishers are looking to bundle paid podcasts and audio books.

1.2 The creator economy and the battle for talent

Over the last few years, we have seen the coming together of two powerful ideas. The first is that online journalism needs to be paid for and the second that journalists may need to behave more like social influencers as they build relationships and communities.

These ideas are embodied in new platforms like Substack, which along with new product offerings from giant tech companies have enabled individual writers, vloggers, and podcasters to make significant amounts of money, injecting new life into the so-called ‘creator economy’. In November Substack announced that it had hit the milestone of 1 million paid subscriptions, with top writers earning six-figure sums from its newsletter focused platform. Both Facebook (Bulletin) and Twitter (Revue) have launched their own competitors to Substack, along with a range of other features to incentivise creators. Twitter, for example, in September 2021 launched a Super Follows subscription feature (think bonus tweets) that helps creators earn money from their most engaged fans. Facebook introduced fan subscriptions and stars, both mechanisms that provide financial rewards for the most engaging content. Meanwhile podcast platforms are enabling similar features with a subscription or donation offer on top of a free service. These developments are setting up new dynamics around who gets attention and what content may be prioritised in years to come.

Twitter Super Follows feature, Facebook Stars, and newsletter and podcast subscriptions

What will happen this year?

Mainstream media poaches back: If last year’s trend was star writers setting up on their own, this year we may see more movement in the opposite direction. Not all writers have found it easy to grow an audience quickly on their own and traditional companies are looking to hoover up talent as a way of feeding subscription pipelines. The Atlantic, for example, is launching a suite of new newsletters including writers like Charlie Warzel, who previously operated his Galaxy Brain brand on Substack. Writers can continue to earn money independently from podcasts and personal appearances and existing followers get a year’s free access to The Atlantic, after which they will need to subscribe.

Journalism collectives as a halfway house: This year we may see more companies that try to mix the infrastructure of a traditional news organisations with the freedom and financial rewards they can find on their own.

Puck is a start-up founded by a former editor of Vanity Fair Jon Kelly, who has brought together a set of writers to cover Silicon Valley, Hollywood, Washington, and Wall Street. ‘There is an elite group of journalists who want to have a direct connection with the large audiences they’ve amassed on social channels’, says Kelly. Founding partners own part of the business but also get bonuses based on the subscriptions and ad sales they generate. For an annual fee, consumers get access to emails across a range of subjects but can also pay a premium for events and personal access to writers.

Connecting writers pay to subscriptions: This is likely to become an increasingly contentious issue this year as media companies rely more on star talent to generate revenue from readers. Puck has an algorithm that works out how to reward those driving most revenue but transparency and fairness will be tested. Casey Newton, one of the current Substack stars, thinks that publishers will eventually need to offer shared revenue on newsletters or video sponsorships or podcast ads: ‘I expect lots of thrashing from journalists who think they have the right to experiment with Super Follows and other creator monetisation tools and publishers who want to shut them down.’

All this activity is creating more and more content, but the big question is whether there are enough people with sufficient interest to pay for all but the star writers and podcasters.

1.3 Make or break year for digital media brands

It wasn’t that long ago that BuzzFeed and a few other digital native brands, such as Vox and Vice, looked like the future of the news business. Sky-high valuations were fuelled by a generation of writers comfortable with digital culture, who invented a set of formats that matched rising consumer enthusiasm for social consumption.

But this open access, ad-supported model has taken a knock following various Facebook algorithm changes, compounded by the shock of coronavirus. Some of the stars of digital media have defected back to old media companies and many venture capitalists (VCs) are looking to get their money back. The original disrupters are now caught in a battle with resurgent legacy media for general readers and with platforms for advertising dollars.

What will happen this year?

Digital natives go for scale: BuzzFeed founder Jonah Peretti has argued for years that digital publishers should consolidate to give them more leverage with advertisers and compete with the ad dominance of Facebook and Google. BuzzFeed’s move to go public, completed in December 2021, provided the cash to acquire digital lifestyle publisher Complex, following last year’s purchase of HuffPost. Now all eyes will be on Vice, Vox, and Bustle as they contemplate similar moves. Vox bought New York Magazine and its websites in 2019 and has just acquired Group Nine (owner of multiple brands including NowThis and PopSugar). By year end we can expect more M&A activity but perhaps not the mega-merger that was predicted some years ago.

Traditional media look to acquisition to fuel growth: The biggest players will be looking for digital brands that can add value to their subscription bundles and bring different types of audience. Axel Springer purchased Politico last year for around $1bn and the New York Times has agreed to buy subscription-based sports site The Athletic, in a deal valued at around $550 million. The Athletic has built built more than 1 million subscribers based on deep reporting in multiple sporting niches.

Local start-ups fuelled by new models: At a local level, we can expect to see the growth of low-cost reader-focused start-ups this year, built on newsletter platforms like Substack, which help take out technology and infrastructure costs.

The Manchester Mill, which launched during the height of COVID lockdowns, has generated almost 1,000 paying subscriptions at £7 a month in the last year for a mix of slow journalism delivered mainly by newsletter. A certain amount of free content gives it a much wider readership and there is now an offshoot in print. Super users engage with the editorial team on a Facebook group providing ideas for stories. And there is a podcast too.

A sister title, the Sheffield Tribune has gained around 300 subscribers and a third, The Post, has just launched covering Liverpool.

Meanwhile in the United States, Axios has plans to expand its newsletter-led model to 25 cities by mid 2022 ­– with 100 soon after. Axios reporters will break local news, hold local officials accountable and offer tips for navigating local areas and hopes that this reader-supported (membership) model can eventually reach ‘every community in America’.

2. Audience strategies and publisher innovation

Following the shock of COVID, the key mood in our survey this year seems to be around consolidation when it comes to product development. Although some media companies are focusing on advertising and others on subscription, the success of both models ultimately depends on deeper engagement with audiences via websites, apps, newsletters, and podcasts.

In terms of audience-facing innovation, most effort this year will go into podcasts and other digital audio (80%), followed by building and revamping newsletters (70%) and developing digital video formats (63%). By contrast, ‘shiny new things’, involving technology that has not yet reached maturity, such as applications for voice (14%) and the metaverse (8%) appear to be largely on the backburner.

2.1 Audio everywhere

Growing consumption of digital audio has been a trend for a few years, driven by a combination of smartphones, better headphones, and investment in podcasts from platforms like Spotify, Google, and Amazon. But in the last year we’ve seen the rapid development of a much wider range of digital formats such as audio articles, flash briefings, and audio messages, along with live formats such as social audio.

The rise (and fall) of Clubhouse, known as the first ‘airpods social network’, has been well documented but almost all the major platforms, such as Twitter (Spaces), Facebook (Live Audio Rooms), Reddit (Talk), quickly produced clones to allow users to create impromptu discussion and events. The jury remains out on how compelling audiences will find these features when the hype dies down.

More widely, the platforms are investing in tools to allow consumers to create and edit their own short audio stories – effectively delivering another layer of the creator economy. Facebook/Meta are building ‘soundbites’, a new creative, short-form audio format that will appear across all their products – a sort of TikTok for audio.

Audio is going to be a first-class medium. Every once in a while, a new medium comes along that can be adopted into a lot of different areas.

Meanwhile audio messaging and communication is gaining traction and finding a new home in a range of apps from cooking to dating. Short audio messages attached to dating profiles within Hinge have added a sense of personality beyond photos and bios – and many have gone viral.

Implications for journalism

Platform investments in audio are opening up the medium to anyone with a smartphone and a story to tell, but this is likely to create a set of familiar problems for publishers. More content means more competition for attention and it may be harder for professional content to stand out. On the other hand, it may also stimulate listening overall, enabling more opportunities for consumption and connection. For platforms, there will be new content moderation challenges in a medium even harder to monitor than written text.

In our conversations around trends and predictions, it is clear that many publishers believe that audio offers better opportunities for both engagement and monetisation than they can get through similar investments in text or video. At least in the United States, podcast CPMs have been buoyant through the pandemic with the New York Times making $36m from podcast ads according to their 2020 results. Equally important though is the value in marketing and attracting new audiences. Tortoise Media, which has pivoted heavily towards audio, ended the year with the No. 1 podcast on the Apple Podcast charts in the United States, Sweet Bobby, introducing many more people to the brand, including much-sought-after younger listeners.

What will happen this year in audio?

More publishers look to become audio destinations of their own: With audio becoming more central, the battle is on between competing platforms and publishers to control the full customer experience. The New York Times is planning to launch a listening product this year which will include article narrations from Audm including stories from rival publications, and shows from Serial Productions, both of which it bought in 2020. It is also likely to include the 25-year archive from public radio programme This American Life. It is also possible that it will feature a long-expected afternoon version of The Daily, the hit podcast that has more than 20 million listeners monthly. In developing the app, the Times has spent identified key ‘moments’ where consumers may be open to audio-only experiences – and its analysis shows that the current offer (in blue) is only scratching the surface.

The new NYT audio app started with identifying moments in the ‘Audio Day’ that could be filled by great content of different lengths

The new app may end up part of the Times subscription bundle, or at least in a premium layer within it. This is another key reason why audio is seen as strategically important. It can deliver reach, loyalty, and revenue in equal measure. Schibsted is also building free and premium audio products in Nordic countries, following the acquisition of Swedish platform PodMe, and says that audio, which includes podcasts, books, and short-form content, is now a core part of its overall strategy.

Elsewhere, some public broadcasters have been considering whether to host podcast content from other publishers and are withholding their best content from the big tech platforms for a period of time.

Second coming for paid podcast platforms: Paid features from Apple and Spotify will open up the market this year for individual creators and publishers alike this year. Unlike Apple, Spotify is not taking a cut for the first two years in a bid to encourage the best talent. Options include offering a mix of free and paid content, including bonus episodes for super fans. Independent podcast platforms are also quietly creating alternatives, especially in smaller markets. Podimo has 100,000+ paying subscribers for high-quality local language content in countries like Denmark, Norway, Germany, and Spain, and has secured funding for further expansion of a model where it shares membership fees with those creating the content. But with publishers joining platforms looking for the best exclusive content expect the price to go up this year, especially for the biggest stars.

2.2 Get set for another pivot to video

The first pivot to video was partly driven by new social media formats like Facebook Live, but quickly faded after the platforms lost interest. Now live video is booming again, partly fuelled by COVID news conferences and dramatic events like the storming of the US Capitol, while short-form video has been revitalised by the creativity and dynamic growth of TikTok.

Publishers are stepping up investment, with NBC, as one example, adding 200 new positions and several new hours of programming for its NBC News NOW service which also feeds the Peacock streaming service. It has also invested heavily in short-form video reaching tens of millions of Gen-Z viewers with its Stay Tuned programming on Snapchat.

Meanwhile TikTok now reaches more than a billion people around the world, according to the company. Users have been captivated by its mix of music, humour (and news) driven by a powerful ‘For You’ feed generated by an algorithm that learns what you like. In turn this success has led Facebook and YouTube to step up development of their own copycat formats (Reels and Shorts), further fuelling creation and promotion of this content.

Our own Digital News Report found that TikTok now reaches a quarter (24%) of under-35s, with 7% using the platform for news – even more in parts of Asia and South America. But our research also found that, when it comes to news, it is mainly influencers and celebrities that people are paying attention to – raising questions about how and whether journalists and news brands should engage on this platform.

Why does this matter for journalism?

Publishers are increasingly worried about how to attract younger audiences and many see native video formats as part of the answer. The Swedish Public Broadcaster SVT is now the number one destination for a quarter (26%) of Swedes aged between 20 and 29 years old – up from just 9% in 2017. Much of that change is due to investment in a range of mobile-friendly online video formats that get to the point quickly or address non-traditional subjects. Other public broadcasters like Germany’s ARD have been experimenting with creating more bespoke video content for third-party platforms like TikTok and Instagram.

In our survey, we can see a clear change in direction in terms of the third-party platforms being prioritised this year. Publishers say they will be putting much more effort into Instagram (net score of +54), TikTok (+44), and YouTube (+43), all networks that lead with visual and video content, and less effort into general purpose networks like Twitter (-5) and Facebook (-8).

What will happen this year in video?

Influencers build mass audiences via networks like Twitch: Ibai Llanos, a Spanish influencer with 7 million followers on the gaming platform Twitch, secured the first interview with footballer Lionel Messi after his transfer to Paris Saint Germain, outcompeting traditional broadcast journalists. More than 300,000 people watched the original broadcast, with more accessing on demand. Llanos is an example of a new generation of entrepreneurial stars who are creating and monetising their communities across a number of platforms. Politicians are also looking to interact on a platform that is especially popular with e-sports fans and young men.

News on TikTok remains a battleground: Publishers looking to crack the code of TikTok’s bite-sized videos are being shown the way by a Spanish start-up. Ac2ality has built up around 3 million followers on TikTok for a service that includes a one-minute round-up of top stories. That’s more followers than the Washington Post and the BBC combined. With more news on TikTok, expect more false and misleading information too. The Institute for Strategic Dialogue recently tracked vaccine misinformation on the platform and found that just over 100 posts had got more than 20 million views thanks to TikTok’s powerful algorithm and unique audio features designed for virality. Some outside observers continue to worry that the Chinese-owned platform will take a different approach to content moderation on politically sensitive topics than its US-owned competitors.

One start-up looking to counter misinformation on TikTok and other social-platforms is the News Movement, founded by former executives from Dow Jones and the BBC. The service aims to deliver trustworthy and objective information in 2022 to mass audiences on social media, with accessible video explainers as well as text. The News Movement is staffed by young journalists and will operate across TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, Facebook and Twitter.

Ac2ality and The News Movement deliver news on TikTok



Social shopping takes off: Expect to find news mixed with more online shopping this year as Instagram, TikTok, and Snap lean into e-commerce. Whether it’s sportswear or make up, consumers are increasingly browsing, discovering, and buying items on social media platforms and the sector is expected to grow in the US alone from $36bn in annual sales to $50bn by 2023, according to research firm eMarketer. Some publishers are looking to cash in, with NBCUniversal experimenting with a show on Instagram, while TikTok has hosted a two-day live-streamed event in the UK with influencers, music, and a quiz. Meanwhile, Snap is investing in augmented reality technology to help users virtually try on items like watches and jewellery.

The big question is whether any of this will work for news publishers. Previous attempts to monetise short-form social video have proved unsuccessful, while e-commerce is most suited to lifestyle brands and breaking news is largely commoditised. Despite this, CNN has taken a brave decision to put its live stream behind a paywall as part of a CNN+ service that will include exclusive on-demand shows. Many other broadcasters will be looking carefully at how that works out in 2022.

2.3 Publishers identify blockers to innovation

Most survey respondents are clear that the main focus this year should be on iterating and improving existing products (67%), rather than investing in new technologies or services (32%). This is partly because publishers have less money available for risky investments but also because most publishers now have a clear path on which they are set. A good starting point is to ensure that existing digital products are as seamless and engaging as those produced by tech platforms. News products have often fallen far short.

In terms of specific initiatives, a number of publishers talked about the need to replace legacy apps, optimise subscription pipelines, and upgrade their data infrastructure. While most are focusing on the core, we also find a small minority of well-funded leading-edge publishers pushing hard for growth, strengthening their business models through brand extensions and acquisitions. The New York Times has found growth with cooking, crosswords, and shopping, and others are looking to adopt similar approaches.

Innovation is becoming a more important part in our growth strategy as we try to go beyond the ‘core’.

Innovation blockers in the year ahead

Publishers recognise that innovation is critical in making sure that they stay relevant as audience behaviours continue to shift. But our survey suggests that, although the strategy is often clear, delivering planned improvements can be a different issue.

Around half (51%) of our sample of publishers say that they don’t have enough money to invest in innovation this year, partly due to budget cuts imposed during COVID. A similar proportion say they are struggling to hire or keep enough technical, design, or data staff to deliver solutions. In our Changing Newsrooms report we found the biggest concerns about talent were around software engineers and data scientists.

Another major barrier to innovation highlighted by the survey includes lack of alignment (41%) between different departments such as editorial, marketing, commercial, and technology. We have previously highlighted how the vertically siloed nature of many media companies makes it particularly difficult to deliver innovation that needs cross-functional teams to work in a common process. ‘We’re now in an age of mature product departments’, says Chris Moran, Head of Editorial Innovation at the Guardian. ‘But we still need to work to find the right balance between the rigour of product methodologies and processes and the specific editorial expertise of a given publisher.’

Moran argues that, if organisations want to innovate the process, they should not start with shiny new technologies like VR or AI: ‘It’s about the right technology applied intelligently in ways that tie to our values and expertise. That way we will build genuinely unique features and products that differentiate us from platforms and their associated problems.’

3. The practice of journalism: hybrid newsrooms, generational change, and new agendas

Almost two years into the pandemic many newsrooms are unrecognisable, some remain largely empty. But journalists are also struggling to cope with burnout from a relentless news cycle which has often impacted their own health, attacks by politicians, harassment on social media, and the isolation that comes with working from home. Behind the scenes much has changed. A new generation of leaders is taking over with a new agenda and more inclusive approach.

3.1 Hybrid working becomes the norm

Assuming that the virus is finally brought under control, this will be the year when hybrid working – with some people in the office and others working remotely – becomes the norm. Our Changing Newsrooms report in November found that news organisations are pressing ahead with plans to redesign offices, upgrade technology, reduce desk space/office space, and renegotiate contracts with employees to","The relentless and depressing nature of the news has been a factor, with many consumers looking to social media and streaming services for entertainment and distraction.

286,286,https://fabrydiseasenews.com/news/4dmts-4d-310-gene-therapy-safe-effective-interim-data/,Interim Data on Fabry Disease 4D-310 Gene Therapy Shows Promise,"Experimental gene therapy 4D-310 continues to be generally safe and has effectively increased enzyme alpha-galactosidase (Gal A) blood levels in the first three patients enrolled in 4D Molecular Therapeutics’s clinical trial.

These results were announced in the presentation “An Open-label, Phase 1/2 Trial of Gene Therapy 4D-310 in Adult Males with Fabry Disease” at the 18th Annual WORLDSymposium annual meeting, held in February in San Diego.

“The evidence of AGA clinical activity and tolerability of 4D-310, as well as the initial encouraging effects on cardiac endpoints, strengthen our belief that 4D-310 represents a promising therapeutic approach for a broad range of patients with Fabry disease,” Raphael Schiffmann, MD, senior vice president of 4D Molecular Therapeutics (4DMT), said in a press release.

The safety, tolerability, and effects of 4D-310 are currently being investigated in the Phase 1/2 (NCT04519749) study, which intends to recruit 18 adult men with Fabry disease. It is recruiting patients, 18 or older, at several locations in the U.S. More information can be found here.

In Fabry disease, the production of Gal A, a protein that breaks down fatty molecules, is prevented by mutations in the GLA gene. This leads to the buildup of toxic metabolites, mainly globotriaosylceramide (Gb3), in vital organs, such as the heart and kidney, as well as in blood vessels.

Enzyme replacement therapies (ERT), which deliver a lab-made version of Gal A into the bloodstream, are a treatment option for Fabry patients. However, these intravenous (into-the-vein) infusions can impact their quality of life. While ERT reduces kidney pathology, its benefits for cardiac symptoms — the leading cause of death and disability in Fabry patients — are not clear.

4D-310 uses a modified and harmless adeno-associated virus (AAV) to deliver a healthy version of the GLA gene to cells. Designed through 4DMT’s Therapeutic Vector Evolution platform, the therapy has a unique dual mechanism of action that restores Gal A levels in the tissues affected in Fabry disease.

Along with promoting high and stable blood Gal A levels that can be taken up by cells in the vicinity, 4D-310 also delivers the working GLA copy directly to target tissue cells, potentially avoiding being blocked by circulating antibodies against Gal A that some patients develop after ERT.

“The dual mechanism-of-action design of 4D-310 opens the potential to treat target tissues through cross-correction from high and sustained blood [Gal A] activity, as well as through direct transduction and AGA expression in target tissues such as the heart, kidney and blood vessels,” Schiffmann said.

The main goal of 4DMT’s trial is to assess the safety and tolerability of 4D-310. Secondary goals include evaluating changes in Gal A activity and lyso-Gb3, a form of Gb3, over time. Participants will be observed for up to one year after a single infusion.

In its first part, participants are receiving a single infusion of three escalating doses of the therapy: 1×1013, 3×1013, and 3×1012 vector genomes (vg) per kg of body weight. The goal is to determine the optimal dose to evaluate in a larger and new group of patients in the dose-expansion phase.

The new data concern the first three men treated with the lowest dose (1×1013 vg/kg), with a data cut-off date of Jan. 13, and a follow-up period ranging from 13 to 37 weeks, post-dosing.

Gal A enzyme activity was within, or significantly above, the normal range in all three patients after 4D-310 infusion, despite all having antibodies against Gal A before treatment.

While all the patients had been previously treated with ERT, patients 1 and 3 stopped after 4D-310 infusion and their mean Gal A activity levels remained stable and significantly above the normal range at week 20 and 37 — 98.8 to 139.7 nanomole per hour per milliliter (nmol/hr/mL).

Because patient 2 was already off ERT before 4D-310 treatment, Gal A activity increased into the normal range. Although his lyso-Gb3 levels were high, they significantly decreased (by more than 50%) within the first four weeks after treatment.

The accumulation of harmful glycolipids in the heart was visualized using MRI and left ventricular contractility, a measure of heart function, was determined using echocardiography. Patient 1 showed a reduction in glycolipid accumulation and improvements in left ventricular contractility. Endpoint results for patients 2 and 3 were not available as of the data cutoff.

All three patients, responding to a Kansas City cardiomyopathy questionnaire, said their heart-related quality of life improved after 4D-310 infusion.

“These updated data highlight encouraging trends toward stability of high levels of blood [Gal A] activity following discontinuation of ERT. In addition, the initial effects on cardiac endpoints suggest the design of 4D-310 has potential for benefit in the heart,” said Jerry Vockley, PhD, a principal investigator of the trial.

According to researchers, 4D-310 continues to show a manageable safety profile with no reported serious adverse reactions. No evidence of significant toxicity has been found in the heart or liver as of the data cutoff. However, patient 2 had a single episode of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) which fully resolved.

“These clinical data suggest that 4D-310 is well tolerated over time and has the potential to effectively treat a broad range of patients with Fabry disease,” Vockley added.","These results were announced in the presentation “An Open-label, Phase 1/2 Trial of Gene Therapy 4D-310 in Adult Males with Fabry Disease” at the 18th Annual WORLDSymposium annual meeting, held in February in San Diego.
The safety, tolerability, and effects of 4D-310 are currently being investigated in the Phase 1/2 (NCT04519749) study, which intends to recruit 18 adult men with Fabry disease.
In Fabry disease, the production of Gal A, a protein that breaks down fatty molecules, is prevented by mutations in the GLA gene.
While ERT reduces kidney pathology, its benefits for cardiac symptoms — the leading cause of death and disability in Fabry patients — are not clear.

Hours later, doctors amputated his legs and fingers","Hours after eating leftovers from a restaurant, a 19-year-old was admitted to the hospital with multiple organ failure and later had both his legs and all his fingers amputated.

The Massachusetts college student had eaten rice, chicken and lo mein from a restaurant. Soon after, he felt abdominal pain and his skin turned a shade of purple, according to a report by The New England Journal of Medicine.

The teenager was admitted to a hospital for ""shock, multiple organ failure, and rash,” and his condition quickly declined. He experienced abnormal breathing, high blood pressure and vomiting. The student had been healthy overall with regular drinking and smoking habits, the report said.

After further tests, he was diagnosed with meningococcal purpura fulminan disease, which caused his stiff neck, nausea, respiratory collapse, shock and organ failure, according to the report. Purpura fulminan is a rare complication that comes with septic shock, which the college student experience, according to the report.

The condition is caused by bacteria and brings symptoms such as sudden fever and vomiting. The Centers for Disease and Control Prevention warns it can “lead to death in as little as a few hours.”

Over the course of his hospital stay, his condition worsened and he developed necrosis, the death of tissue and cells. At that point, doctors had to amputate his legs and fingers, according to the report. He also needed a pacemaker for 13 days to treat his cardiac dysfunction.

Experts have warned against the dangers of improperly storing leftover rice because items such as rice and pasta contain a bacterium called Bacillus cereus. The bacteria produces a toxin when heated and left out too long, according to the CDC. In 2008, a teenager died in his sleep after eating leftover pasta that wasn't refrigerated overnight, a case that was reported in the Journal of Clinical Microbiology.

The medical team learned that although the Massachusetts student had received a first dose of the meningococcal vaccine, he never received the recommended booster. His roommate also ate the leftover food and vomited but didn't have life-threatening reactions.

290,290,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/feb/26/credit-card-fraud-scammers-guess-attacks,Scammers guessed my credit card number – and they could guess yours too,"I am no stranger to credit card fraud: in the past I have had my card cloned and had the details stolen from a hack on a retailer. But I thought a card I had never used would be safe from the threat of crime. I was wrong.

Even if you lock your credit card in a safe the moment it arrives, you can still fall victim to charges made by criminals. But how can criminals steal your card details if you’ve never even used them?

At 10pm on a quiet Thursday night in January, I got a text from my bank, Halifax, saying my credit card had been used at Domino’s Pizza for an order costing £30.67.

After 30 minutes on hold on an extremely busy Halifax line the customer service rep asked why I had called. “Fraud,” I said. “Domino’s?” he replied. Clearly, I wasn’t the only one paying for someone else’s takeaway.

In fact, the UK appears to have been in the grip of a takeway fraud boom. Recently a colleague’s card details were used to order £300 worth of takeways in the Andover area all over a single weekend.

This week, thousands of First Direct customers found their cards had been used to order chicken dinners in Nando’s. Mention to friends or family that your card was used by fraudsters to buy takeaways, and you will soon learn that you not alone.

In my case, Halifax froze my card to prevent further charges, and the next morning the card was cancelled and the charges marked to be refunded. Three days later a replacement card arrived on the doormat. Having activated it, I stashed it safely in a drawer. The next day I checked my statement to make sure the pizzas had been refunded – only to find to my horror seven fresh fraudulent charges totalling £465 – all on my new card. These weren’t at Domino’s but an unfamiliar sportswear company in the Midlands.

Given I had only activated the card 16 hours prior, hadn’t used it, entered the new number into Apple Pay or any other service, it hadn’t left the house and no one else had access to it, how on earth had someone already spent money on it?

I am not the only person to have found myself asking this question recently – this week, the Guardian Money reader Phoebe Maddrell got in touch to say that her debit card details had been used for fraudulent transactions even though she had never used it – either online or in person.

In my case, Halifax’s fraud investigations team said I had fallen victim to what is called a “guess attack”, where an organised criminal gang work out the card number and the expiry date. They didn’t need to have stolen the card number in a hack or physical theft, and were able to use it as soon as it was activated.

Looking at a bank card’s 16-digit card number and four-digit expiry date, you might be forgiven for thinking that the combination would be too complex to simply guess. Unfortunately, it is very much not the case.

“The first thing to realise is that you are not guessing the full 16 numbers at random,” says Jake Moore, a global cybersecurity adviser at Eset. “The first six digits of a credit card number signify the card network and the issuing bank, while the final digit is the Luhn algorithm checksum.”

That means they only have to guess seven numbers, while that final Luhn digit helps verify whether the rest of the card number is valid. The checksum was originally designed to help spot manual input errors, such as mistyped numbers or transposed sequences, but it can also be used by criminals to verify a number could be real.

“There are websites out there that have Luhn verifiers which help find these numbers in little or no time at all, making the chances of locating a card in use relatively high,” Moore says.

Once a criminal gang has a potentially valid credit card number it can then try it out to see if it is in use. The card verification value (CVV) – the three digits usually printed on the back of the card in or next to the signature strip – helps prevent this kind of attack by adding further burden on the criminals.

“There are, however, many websites – often located outside the UK – that will accept card payments without any need for a three-digit CVV number or any other proof of identity,” Moore says.

Criminals typically target websites that handle large volumes of low-value transactions

Banks and card companies have sophisticated technologies in place to spot and prevent these sorts of attacks from happening in real time using certain characteristics of each transaction. Reports after the fact help refine the systems so they can stop more like it.

Criminals typically target websites that handle large volumes of low-value transactions, which makes it more difficult to spot fraud from the hundreds of thousands of genuine purchases.

Once an attack is identified additional checks are implemented to block it and prevent further similar frauds but some will pass through at first.

In my case, Domino’s did request the CVV of the first card but that, too, was guessed, allowing two of the transactions through before further transactions were flagged by Halifax’s systems. Takeways appear to be targeted as they regularly process low-value purchases where the card is not present. Criminals use a card’s details to make a series of rapid purchases until the card is stopped.

A Halifax spokesperson says: “Through our multilayered fraud detection systems, we never stop fighting to prevent fraud, blocking the vast majority that is attempted. Unfortunately, highly sophisticated criminal gangs also never stop trying to break our defences and some fraud does get through.”

This case has certainly made me reconsider the number of bank cards I hold and why. With every account opened, another card arrives that could result in me being a victim of fraud even if I never use it. Credit card fraud cost the UK £574.2m in 2020, according to data from UK Finance, including £376.5m of e-commerce fraud. While banks refunded 98% of customers and prevented an additional £983m of fraud in the year, there is always a risk it could happen to you.

What can you do to protect yourself?

Protecting yourself against a guess attack is difficult but there are things you can do to prevent the damage they cause.

Never approve a transaction you weren’t expecting. Measures to comply with the new strong customer authentication regulations are being phased in before the March 2022 deadline. These will typically require customers to verify some transactions via a one-time passcode sent by SMS or banking app prompt for about one in four online transactions.

Most card issuers allow you to freeze or temporarily deactivate all or parts of the card’s functions. These include blocking transactions outside the UK, online or over the phone, in person or contactless payments. Freezes do not stop recurring transactions, direct debits or transactions where the retailers do not ask the bank for verification, such as public transport.

Report fraud to your bank immediately you spot it. Moore says: “I always advise people to check their bank statements regularly, even daily, to spot any discrepancies. If card details are stolen and slip through the net a small number of times, these cards become very valuable indeed and can be used multiple times, even for years on end, without raising suspicions.”

‘I am concerned that something strange is going on’

Phoebe Maddrell from Herefordshire was one of thousands of First Direct’s customers hit by fraudulent spending at the fast food chain Nando’s.

She received a message on the morning of 17 February querying a £42 payment from the debit card linked to her account. She saw it when she woke up, and responded to say she hadn’t made the payment.

“I then logged into my internet banking and saw that there were multiple transactions via Apple that I didn’t recognise,” she says.

“I started the account last June for saving. I’ve never taken the card out of the house; it’s never been used at a retailer.”

Maddrell contacted the bank straight away and was told that the Nando’s transaction had been blocked, and that the card would be cancelled and the Apple payments not charged to her account. However, later that day the Apple payments went through.

“I really am concerned that something strange is going on,” she says. “There is no way that the fraudsters could have obtained the card details from anywhere. Unless somehow these were breached when the card was sent to me in the post.”

Maddrell’s bank would not shed any light on how the fraud had occurred, saying it could not do so for security reasons, but said there had not been a data breach.

It says Maddrell will be repaid in full and will not need to speak to the fraud team.

A First Direct spokesperson said: “We are aware of some low-value unauthorised retail transactions appearing on a small number of our customers’ cards.

“We want to reassure impacted customers that they will not be left out of pocket and apologise for any inconvenience caused.

“We take our customers’ security very seriously and will be reaching out to affected customers in the coming days.

“We would advise customers to regularly check their statements and get in touch if they notice any suspicious activity.”

Maddrell has complained to the Information Commissioner’s Office about her case, and to the financial ombudsman about First Direct’s unwillingness to explain how the fraud happened, and because she was unable to reach the fraud team at first and told there was a four-week wait for a callback.

291,291,https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/03/1113702,"Social media poses ‘existential threat’ to traditional, trustworthy news: UNESCO","In the past five years, both news audiences and advertising revenues have moved in huge numbers to internet platforms, with only two companies - Google and Meta (formerly known as Facebook) – soaking up half of all global digital advertising spending.

The United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) analysed media development trends from 2016 to 2021 and found that global newspaper advertising revenue has fallen by half during the five year period.

Social media feast, news famine

The report indicates that news outlets often struggle to get clicks from readers that determine advertising revenue, and many find themselves “squeezed out” by the proliferation of new voices in the online space and algorithms of digital intermediaries.

“The digital ecosystem has unleashed a flood of competing content and turned large internet companies into the new gatekeepers”, the study explains.

Moreover, with social media users nearly doubling from 2.3 billion in 2016, to 4.2 billion in 2021, there has been greater access to more content and more voices - but not necessarily with the distinctive added value of journalistic content, the study says.

Source: UNESCO Share of global advertising expenditure by medium over time.

COVID-19 pandemic

The COVID-19 pandemic has only made the trend worse by exacerbating the decline of advertising revenue, job losses and newsroom closures, the report finds.

In a pandemic, journalism is a life-saving frontline service. However, false content related to COVID-19 spread rapidly on social media, while journalistic job cuts created a ‘significant vacuum’ in the information landscape, particularly in low and middle-income countries.

“In September of 2020, over one million posts circulated on Twitter with inaccurate, unreliable, or misleading information related to the pandemic, according to the COVID-19 Infodemics Observatory, an initiative of the Fondazione Bruno Kessler”, UNESCO details.

Meanwhile, a survey among 1,400 journalists found that at least two-thirds of them now feel less secure in their jobs, because of the economic pressures of the pandemic.

Journalists are still under attack

Besides the economic and misinformation/disinformation hurdles journalists face, in the past five years, they have also continued to be targeted around the world.

From 2016 to the end of 2021, UNESCO recorded the killings of 455 journalists, who were either targeted as a result of their work, or while on the job. Almost nine out of ten killings remain unresolved, shining light on a general impunity for these crimes around the world.

According to the report, there have also been increasing threats to the safety of journalists not only from governments and criminal groups but also from private lobbies and from some members of the public who feel increasingly emboldened to launch slurs and attacks online.

In fact, a surge in online violence against journalists is another new and evolving trend, and one which disproportionately affects women journalists all around the world.

A 2021 UNESCO paper found that more than seven out of ten of women journalists surveyed had experienced online violence and a fifth reported being victims of offline violence in connection with online threats.

Worrying imprisonments

At the same time, attacks against journalists covering protests, demonstrations and riots are “worryingly common” while imprisonment of journalists has reached record highs.

In many countries, laws do not protect journalists against these threats, and in some, they actually increase the risk of them.

According to the report, since 2016, 44 countries have adopted or amended new laws that contain vague language or threaten disproportionate punishments for actions like spreading so-called fake news, alleged rumours, or “cyber-libel”, leading to self-censorship.

Meanwhile, in 160 countries charges of defamation are still a criminal offence. When defamation law is criminal, rather than civil, it can be used as grounds for arrest or detention, effectively muzzling journalists, UNESCO warns.

The report cites data from the Committee to Protect Journalists showing that 293 journalists were imprisoned in 2021, the highest yearly total in three decades.

Recommendations

In light of the worrying trends, UNESCO urged governments to take policy-driven action in three key areas to protect independent media and journalists’ safety.

Supporting the economic viability of independent news media while respecting the professional autonomy of journalists. Governments can, for example, offer tax benefits to independent news outlets in a fair and transparent manner, and without compromising editorial independence.

Since January, at least 10 victims have fallen prey to such scams, with total losses amounting to at least $95,000.

In one instance, scammers pretended to sell jade on TikTok live streams.

After victims agreed to buy the jade, the scammers provided a bank account number for the victims’ payments. The scammers would then claim they did not receive the payment, or would become uncontactable.

In another instance, victims would “invest” in raw jade stones, where the return on investment depended on the value of cut jade stones.

Investors transferred money to the scammers’ bank accounts in advance. Over TikTok live streams, the scammers would then cut the raw jade stones to determine their value.

For high-quality stones, the scammers would “purchase” these back at a higher price from the victims who had made investments. They would also promise to refund the victims if the jade stones were of poor quality or no value.

The victims would realise these were scams after they failed to receive refunds or returns on their investment, or when the scammers became uncontactable.

In their statement, the police also issued advice on how to protect oneself against being scammed. The public is advised to:

1. Add the ScamShield App and set security features. For example, enable the two-factor or multifactor authentication for bank, social media and Singpass accounts. Set transaction limits for Internet banking transactions including PayNow.

2. Check for scam signs with official sources. Visit www.scamalert.sg or call the anti-scam helpline on 1800-722-6688.

Purchase items only from authorised sellers or reputable sources, and beware of time-sensitive deals due to limited stocks. Avoid making upfront payments to bank accounts belonging to unknown individuals, and avoid making advance payments or direct bank transfers to sellers. Always verify sellers’ profiles through customer reviews and ratings.

3. Tell the authorities, family, and friends about this scam, so they do not fall for it. Report the fraudulent pages to TikTok.

294,294,https://bmcgastroenterol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12876-022-02178-0,Efficacy of sigmoidoscopy for evaluating disease activity in patients with ulcerative colitis - BMC Gastroenterology,"In the present study, we confirmed high concordance of MES and UCEIS between the rectosigmoid area and the entire colon. In patients with ulcerative colitis, endoscopic assessment is a very important indicator for evaluating not only the severity of worsening symptoms but also mucosal healing as a long-term treatment target [14,15,16]. Our results suggest that sigmoidoscopy is sufficient as a follow-up test to evaluate disease activity after the diagnosis of ulcerative colitis.

The merits of sigmoidoscopy are that it is safe, cost-effective, has a short procedure time, and does not require sedation. However, there are concerns about whether sigmoidoscopy can represent the disease activity of the entire colon. First, atypical distributions such as rectal sparing and skipped lesions were identified in 12.6% of initial colonoscopies in patients with ulcerative colitis [17]. Second, more severe endoscopic findings were often found in the proximal region during follow-up colonoscopy after treatment in clinical practice. To date, there is no consensus on whether sigmoidoscopy alone can represent the disease activity of the entire colon. In the previous two studies, retrospective analysis of colonoscopy images of patients with ulcerative colitis confirmed the endoscopic evaluation of the rectosigmoid area, which can be confirmed by sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy, and contradictory results were reported. According to Kato et al. [8] 27% (147/545) of patients with ulcerative colitis had maximum inflammation in the descending colon or proximal colon. They insisted that sigmoidoscopy was not sufficient for evaluating patients with ulcerative colitis and that colonoscopy would be necessary, especially in patients experiencing the first attack. However, this study could not determine the extent and severity of the previous disease. As mentioned above, atypical distribution at the time of diagnosis is relatively high; thus, there is a limitation in accurately reflecting it in the evaluation of disease activity. It also did not accurately reflect the definition of actual endoscopic healing (MES = 0 or UCEIS ≤ 1) or active disease (MES ≥ 2 or UCEIS ≥ 5). According to Colombel et al. [9] in only 3.7% (9/239) of cases the detection of active disease and 5.0% (7/139) of cases the assessment of endoscopic healing discordant findings were obsz 0erved between the rectosigmoid area and proximal area. They insisted on a high degree of correlation in the assessment of ulcerative colitis between sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy. However, in this study, only patients undergoing induction treatment were enrolled in the etrolizumab phase 2 study; thus, it is challenging to represent all patients with ulcerative colitis. In addition, since this was a retrospective study and the video was analyzed, the boundary for each segment was ambiguous.

In contrast, our study is a multicenter study involving seven institutions, thereby minimizing patient selection bias, and it reviewed the extent and severity of ulcerative colitis at the time of diagnosis. We analyzed patients with more severe endoscopic findings in the proximal area and confirmed that colonoscopy was required for activity evaluation in patients with extensive colitis and high total Mayo score. In addition, although not statistically significant, fecal calprotectin was confirmed to be high in the group that required a colonoscopy. The reason fecal calprotectin is not statistically significant is thought to be that because it is a fecal examination, patients do not get tested in certain cases. Fecal calprotectin is a non-invasive biomarker that can predict disease activity in ulcerative colitis and has a high concordance with endoscopic findings [18,19,20]. Elevated fecal calprotectin levels suggest more severe inflammation, and colonoscopy may be necessary to confirm more proximal lesions. However, being a retrospective study, our study could not confirm the cut-off value for fecal calprotectin requiring colonoscopy. Therefore, future prospective studies are required.

Since suppository is a topical treatment, it is likely a risk factor for a mismatch between the proximal lesion and sigmoidoscopy. However, in our study, topical therapy did not affect the discrepancy between proximal and rectal colon lesions. This is probably because, in our study, colonoscopy was divided into fractions, and sigmoidoscopy not only examined the rectum but also included the sigmoid colon. In general, the principle of sigmoidoscopy is to check the region below the splenic flexus, that is, even the descending colon. We additionally analyzed the concordance between the left-sided colon (rectum, sigmoid, and descending colon) and the proximal colon (ascending and transverse colon). In only 2.4% of the cases [k(kappa): 0.934, r(Spearman): 0.956, p < 0.001), the proximal colon had a more severe score (Additional file 1: Fig. 1). Therefore, when evaluating disease activity with sigmoidoscopy, a more accurate evaluation would be possible if the descending colon was intubated.

This study has certain limitations. First, this is a retrospective study of colonic images. The colonoscopy images analyzed in this study did not accurately represent the disease activity of the entire colon. However, this study was conducted at a tertiary university hospital in South Korea, which receives endoscopy certification every 3 years. Since all colonoscopies require storing high-resolution images for each segment, it is thought that more accurate data were enrolled. Second, only patients with ulcerative colitis who had undergone colonoscopy were enrolled in our study. Patients with severe inflammation who could not undergo colonoscopy were underestimated, and there was a relatively high probability of selection bias.

In conclusion, our study is the first multicenter study to show that sigmoidoscopy alone is sufficient to confirm disease activity. It is recommended to insert the endoscope up to the descending colon when performing sigmoidoscopy to increase the accuracy. In the case of patients with extensive colitis, colonoscopy should be considered as a test to confirm disease activity.","Our results suggest that sigmoidoscopy is sufficient as a follow-up test to evaluate disease activity after the diagnosis of ulcerative colitis.

295,295,https://healthcare.utah.edu/healthfeed/2022/03/managing-most-common-inherited-heart-disease-of-heart-muscle,Managing the Most Common Inherited Heart Disease of the Heart Muscle,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or HCM, is a genetic disease that causes the heart muscle to become thicker, making it harder for the heart to pump blood. It's a condition that affects one in 200-500 people. HCM often goes undiagnosed but is usually discovered during cardiac testing.

In HCM, the patient will develop heart failure symptoms. Up to two-thirds of patients also develop an obstruction of the outlet of the heart, according to Omar Wever-Pinzon, MD, medical director of the Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Program at University of Utah Health. ""We call that left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, and it too leads to symptoms of heart failure,"" he says. Those symptoms include:

Chest pain

Lightheadedness

Palpitations

Fatigue

Shortness of breath

Fainting

Peripheral edema

Abdominal bloating

With obstructive HCM, chest pain and fainting are more prevalent, while with unobstructive HCM there is more fatigue and fluid retention.

Genetic Testing

Until recently, the only way to screen family members for HCM was through periodic echocardiograms. Today, genetic testing is the standard for families in which a genetic mutation is identified. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy genetics is also fast evolving. If you had genetic testing more than five years ago and suspect HCM, Wever-Pinzon advises you to review the results with your doctor and potentially be tested again because new genes have been added to the panel.

Diagnosis and Prevalence

HCM is diagnosed through cardiac imaging. Normal thickness is 10 millimeters or less, but HCM occurs when the heart wall thickening is 13 to 15 millimeters. ""When the ventricular wall gets to three centimeters or more, that's very concerning as it increases your risk for a dangerous heart rhythm that can lead to sudden death,"" Wever-Pinzon says. This affects one percent of HCM patients.

Clinicians assess several factors to determine risk:

Family history

Fainting without explanation

Heart monitor findings

Heart muscle measurements

Amount of cardiac fibrosis

Heart function status

Presence of an apical aneurism

Wever-Pinzon says a risk factor for sudden death is if the patient has a special kind of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy where they develop an apical aneurysm, or an aneurysm of the tip of the heart.

Treatment and Management

Of the two types of HCM—with and without obstruction—hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy is easier to manage with:

Medications (beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, or disopyramide)

Septal reductive therapies, which involve surgery (septal myectomy)

Catheter-based procedure (alcohol septal ablation)

""Unobstructed HCM requires that we relax the heart, and there are no medications specifically for that,"" Wever-Pinzon clarifies.

That said, in April 2022, the FDA will review a new agent for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy treatment, a group of medications called cardiac myosin inhibitors. ""We're part of those studies,"" which are ""very promising,"" Wever-Pinzon says.

In the meantime, diuretics are prescribed to help reduce excessive fluid that comes with unobstructive HCM, plus medicine to control blood pressure. ""In some patients, we're attempting apical and extended septal myectomies,"" Wever-Pinzon says. ""The option of last resort is a heart transplant.""

Tracking is also critical. An echocardiogram or a cardiac MRI is done initially, followed by an annual EKG. The cardiac MRI or echocardiogram is repeated every three to five years.

Children and the Future

Children are typically born with a normal looking heart, but thickening of the heart muscle can occur in the teenage years. Young athletes that die suddenly with strenuous exertion typically have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, Wever-Pinzon says, which is why HCM patients are advised to avoid competitive sports. ""Recreational and moderate exercise seems to be OK though, as long as it doesn't trigger symptoms,"" he says.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a disease that's managed, but not cured—at least not yet. ""There are studies looking at gene therapy,"" Wever-Pinzon says. ""If they prove successful, that would be something leading to a cure.""","Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or HCM, is a genetic disease that causes the heart muscle to become thicker, making it harder for the heart to pump blood.

296,296,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/1/30/singapore-migrant-workers-covid-curbs,Singapore migrant workers labour under COVID curbs,"While most of the city-state’s residents are able to live their lives much as before, migrant workers still find their freedoms restricted.

Singapore – Nestled between towering rows of public housing blocks and a busy road surrounded by trees, the Choa Chu Kang migrant worker compound is almost hidden in plain sight.

A temporary grey wall conceals the compound, which sits in the northwest of Singapore island, making it almost impossible for anyone in the many passing cars to catch a glimpse of what is inside.

Behind the wall sits a cluster of identical blue-roofed dormitories. Barbed wire topped fences are everywhere, surrounding the buildings and even one of the compound’s basketball courts.

The compound is home to some of the more than 300,000 migrant workers who live and work in Singapore, but even as the island eases some coronavirus restrictions to allow the fully vaccinated to travel again, the people here and in the city-state’s many other worker dormitories have no such freedoms.

“It gives us an inferiority complex because before COVID we could go outside, use transport, do everything, we never thought that we were overseas workers,” said 36-year-old Narayan, who comes from Bangladesh and works in construction.

“Now we cannot go outside and now we remember that we are overseas workers. It is not normal life,” said Narayan, who requested anonymity for fear of losing his job.

For two years, workers like Narayan have been living under strict COVID-19 controls.

The only time they leave their dormitory compounds is to go to work. If they want to visit the recreation centres set up for them nearby, they must use a phone app to apply for an exit pass, which enables them to leave the dorm.

A maximum of 3,000 fully vaccinated workers are allowed out into the wider community each weekday, with double that number able to visit public places on weekends and holidays. Most of the men work six days a week.

‘Not normal life’

Such a controlled existence is in stark contrast to the lives of other Singapore residents for whom life is finally returning to some sort of normality as the country moves towards “living with COVID”.

Narayan, who has been in Singapore for almost 10 years, is growing increasingly frustrated by the restrictions on his life.

“We [the workers] hope the government can think about us. We are human. We cannot stay in the dormitories for so long. Especially for our mental health, it is not normal life.”

When COVID-19 first arrived in Singapore some two years ago, the government managed to keep control of the situation through a meticulous contact tracing system. The country stayed open, with just relatively minor restrictions imposed.

But once cases began to emerge among migrant workers, the virus tore through their cramped accommodation.

“Due to their in-dormitory living conditions which do not allow much room for proper isolation, dormitory-dwelling migrant workers would be more susceptible to infectious diseases,” Michael Cheah, Executive Director of HealthServe, a non-profit group that provides medical care to workers, told Al Jazeera.

Many of the men work as manual labourers in the kind of physically demanding jobs that Singaporeans prefer not to do.

The government does not provide a breakdown of their nationalities, but most come from South Asia.

“When the pandemic hit in the first year, migrant workers had accounted for almost 90 percent of the confirmed cases in Singapore. This led to dormitory lockdowns and prolonged movement restrictions for the disadvantaged group,” said Cheah.

The first full dormitory lockdowns were imposed in April 2020. Workers were instructed to stay in their dorms and warned against mixing with other workers in common areas.

At the time, the island itself was in what the government called a “circuit-breaker” lockdown, but since then, the divide between the workers inside, and the rest of the community outside, has been impossible to ignore.

Migrant workers are almost entirely cut off from the general public. They are transported around Singapore in the back of lorries and are often only seen at the entrances of building sites or preparing to work on the roads late at night.

“I don’t think there is any difference between a person living in a jail and me. I feel isolated because of the COVID rules and I feel very sad about the difference in the lives between me and the rest of the people,” said 30-year-old labourer Mohammed, who also spoke under condition of anonymity.

Mohammed came to Singapore from Bangladesh eight years ago and has spent the last eight months stuck in his room after suffering an accident at his workplace. The only time he is allowed to leave is to see a doctor.

“We are all humans and all have the same rights and COVID has a risk for everyone equally. I would like to ask the lawmakers why they are treating us differently when we are all the same. We are still humans and we all need freedom.”

“Apart from COVID there are other illnesses that are impacting foreign workers who are unable to seek treatment as they are locked up,” he added.

Concerns for future

The continued separation from society has led to mental health struggles for the men.

Singapore’s Yale-NUS college surveyed just more than 1,000 migrant workers during a period of lockdown in 2020, concluding that the movement restrictions had led to increased levels of depression and stress.

“The social isolation has led to a worrying increase in their mental distress – with more workers experiencing symptoms of depression and anxiety over the future, and even suicide risk. This is often on top of workers’ existing challenges related to finances, employment, family and health,” said Cheah.

Al Jazeera contacted Singapore’s Manpower Minister Tan See Leng, who declined an interview request.

In a written statement, the Ministry of Manpower said: “We have kept health outcomes among migrant workers good with very low numbers of mortalities amongst migrant workers staying in dormitories in mid-2020, even before vaccination was available in Singapore, and none since vaccination was rolled out.”

In response to queries about mental health support for the workers, the ministry said it had “implemented a comprehensive support system to meet migrant workers’ mental wellbeing needs” and offered volunteer counselling services in-person as well as through hotlines.

When pressed on the continued restrictions on workers’ lives and when they might be able to enjoy the freedoms they had before the pandemic, the ministry acknowledged it had been a “trying period” for the men.

“We will continue to make adjustments to meet the recreation and social needs of migrant workers while safeguarding their health,” the ministry said.

Before the pandemic struck, the workers took the opportunity of their day off to meet up with their friends in Little India, a central part of Singapore known for its South Asian restaurants and shops.

It was here, in 2013, that a worker was run over by a bus, triggering unrest that shocked the country.

It was Singapore’s first riot for more than 40 years and led to questions over the treatment of migrant workers.

With more than 98 percent of the workers living in dorms now fully vaccinated, some say there is no longer any “rational justification” for the authorities to persist with such tough restrictions.

“It raises the possibility that the government sees COVID-19 as an opportunity to institutionalise far stricter controls over migrant labour in Singapore, well beyond what the disease justifies,” said Alex Au, vice president of Transient Workers Count Too, a non-profit that advocates for equitable treatment for migrant workers.

“Our concern is that it will go well beyond the day when the pandemic becomes history.”","While most of the city-state’s residents are able to live their lives much as before, migrant workers still find their freedoms restricted.

297,297,https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2022/1/27/expats-exit-easy-singapore-as-covid-controls-bite,Expats exit ‘easy’ Singapore as COVID controls bite,"Two years of mask-wearing, social distancing, travel restrictions are making some expats rethink life in the city.

Atar Sandler arrived in Singapore in 2019, seizing the opportunity to live in a buzzing global city that is also a convenient base to jet off to more exotic locales nearby.

But after two years of mask-wearing, socialising only in limited groups and travel restrictions to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, the Israeli human resources professional packed her bags for New York with her husband and children this month.

“It’s been like this for so long. And it doesn’t feel like anything’s going to change here,” said Sandler. “Life is very, very easy here. (But) is it worth it to live such a convenient life without being able to see family, friends, without being able to travel?”

Risk-averse Singapore is trying to balance its approach to living with COVID – aiming to protect people in the densely populated island from the disease while reopening its economy and borders to maintain its reputation as a hub for capital and talent.

Companies and expatriate professionals have long been drawn to the business-friendly country, one of the safest places in the world with a high quality of living, political stability, a skilled workforce, ease of travel and low taxes.

But COVID has prompted soul-searching among many relatively affluent expats in Singapore, where foreign workers make up a fifth of the 5.5 million population.

Some compare its strict COVID rules with more freedom back home or bemoan the inability to travel freely to visit family, while others joined the “great resignation” wave seen around the world.

For Sandler, it was “devastating” that giving birth to her daughter in the middle of the outbreak meant her family did not meet her second child for a year.

Singapore has continued to attract new investment and foreign talent during the pandemic, but a drop in foreigners sent its population down by the most since 1950 – 4.1 percent lower year-on-year as of June 2021.

That is mostly due to fewer numbers of lower-wage workers, typically employed in construction and marine services.

But even the number of employment passholders, or professionals earning at least 4,500 Singaporean dollars ($3,350) a month, fell nearly 14 percent from 193,700 in December 2019 to 166,900 in June 2021.

Expatriate life is, by nature, transient and many left because companies cut costs and jobs. As foreign workers departed, border restrictions meant businesses were unable to bring in replacements from overseas easily.

But for Filipina Nessa Santos, who worked in the city-state for a decade, and her British husband, the pandemic was the push they needed to move from Singapore, a tiny urban island with no hinterland, to the English countryside with their children.

“Even though our jobs were good, it was also very stressful and very demanding,” said Santos. “We didn’t want that kind of lifestyle any more.”

And Chris Anderson, who moved to Singapore in 2019 from Hong Kong, has returned home to the United States to join a tech start-up. He was perturbed by rules last year that restricted foreigners from returning to the city-state despite being residents.

“You leave the country, you’re not a priority to get back in… that’s always at the back of your mind,” Anderson said.

Trickling in from Hong Kong

Still, Singapore has been making it easier for travellers to enter and is looking more attractive to expatriates living in rival financial centre Hong Kong, which has far stiffer rules due to its zero-COVID strategy.

There has been a “trickle” of movement from Hong Kong into Singapore, said Lee Quane, regional director at relocation firm ECA International. He expects expatriate outflows from Singapore to outpace inflows through 2022, citing tighter foreign worker policies and wariness over potential curbs due to virus variants.

The net decline in the non-resident workforce slowed in 2021, with a small net gain in November, the manpower ministry said in a written response to parliamentary questions last week.

Barring unforeseen circumstances, the government, which has stressed the importance of staying open, expects “to hold the course” of calibrated easing in border restrictions.

“The government works hard to ensure that businesses and individuals continue to choose Singapore because of our openness, rule of law, and consistency in policies,” it said.

Companies continue to bring in key talent and receive approvals for work passes, according to Hsien-Hsien Lei, the CEO of the American Chamber of Commerce in Singapore.

“Sure, things aren’t perfect. But, Singapore, from a relative point of view is a great place to live and do business,” said Lei","Two years of mask-wearing, social distancing, travel restrictions are making some expats rethink life in the city.
But COVID has prompted soul-searching among many relatively affluent expats in Singapore, where foreign workers make up a fifth of the 5.5 million population.

An analysis of nearly 600,000 adults in the U.S. found people with bipolar disorder, schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder had up to double the estimated cardiovascular risk levels than those without such illnesses, even at younger ages.

The study focused on adults diagnosed with one of those three serious mental illnesses, who were not hospitalized or living in a mental health treatment center and estimated their 10-year and 30-year cardiovascular risk.

Earlier identification and management of major cardiovascular risk factors — including obesity, smoking, diabetes and high blood pressure — in young adults with a serious mental illness may reduce risk of heart disease and improve outcomes, researchers said.

DALLAS, March 9, 2022 — An analysis of nearly 600,000 adults in the U.S. found that those diagnosed with bipolar disorder, schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder may have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease at younger ages compared to adults not diagnosed with one of those serious mental illnesses, according to new research published today in the Journal of the American Heart Association, an open access, peer-reviewed journal of the American Heart Association.

“Previous research has indicated that people diagnosed with a serious mental illness die 10-20 years earlier than the general population, and their leading cause of death is heart disease,” said study lead author Rebecca C. Rossom, M.D., M.S., a senior research investigator in behavioral health at the Center for Chronic Care Innovation at HealthPartners Institute in Minneapolis, Minnesota. “Our study focused on the contribution of cardiovascular risk factors, such as blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar, body mass index and smoking status, to compare overall heart disease risk for people with and without serious mental illness.”

The researchers believe this is the first study to examine estimated 30-year (lifetime) cardiovascular risk in a large sample of adult outpatients diagnosed with bipolar disorder, schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder - three serious mental illnesses specific to this study. Many previous studies of cardiovascular risk for people with serious mental illness have included only people who were hospitalized, and they tend to have more severe mental illness and frailer health than outpatients, according to Rossom. In contrast, this study, included a large sample of non-hospitalized U.S. adults.

According to the National Institute of Mental Health, bipolar disorder (formerly called manic-depressive illness or manic depression) is a mental illness that causes unusual shifts in mood, energy, activity levels, concentration and the ability to carry out day-to-day tasks. Schizophrenia can cause hallucinations, delusions or disorganized speech. People with schizophrenia may seem like they have lost touch with reality, which can cause significant distress for the individual, their family and friends. The symptoms of schizophrenia can be persistent and disabling. Schizoaffective disorder is defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders as an uninterrupted duration of illness during which there is a major mood episode (manic or depressive) in addition to meeting criteria for schizophrenia.

This analysis evaluated health data for nearly 600,000 people, ages 18-75 years, who visited a primary care clinic in Minnesota and Wisconsin between January 2016 and September 2018. Nearly 2%, or approximately 11,000 adults, had a diagnosis of serious mental illness. Of these, 70% were diagnosed with bipolar disorder, 18% with schizoaffective disorder and 12% with schizophrenia. On average, people with serious mental illness were more likely to be younger; female; self-identify as Black race, Native American, Alaskan race or of multiple races; and be insured by Medicaid or Medicare, compared to their counterparts not diagnosed with one of those three serious mental illnesses.

Prediction models providing a standardized metric were used to assess cardiovascular risk factors and predict the likelihood of a heart attack, stroke or cardiovascular death. To assess 10-year risk, the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association’s atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk scoring tool was used for adults ages 40-75 years old. The Framingham Risk Score was used to estimate 30-year cardiovascular risk among adults ages 18-59 years old.

Researchers found:

Adults in the study with one of the serious mental illnesses reviewed had an estimated 10-year cardiovascular risk level of 9.5%, compared to 8% for adults without a mental condition.

The estimated 30-year risk of cardiovascular disease was significantly higher among those individuals with one of the three serious mental illnesses - 25% compared to 11% of people without a serious mental illness.

The increased risk of heart disease was evident even in young adults (ages 18-34) with a serious mental illness.

Within the subtypes of each of the three serious mental illnesses in this study, in analyses adjusted for age, sex, race, ethnicity and insurance coverage, people with bipolar disorder had the highest 10-year cardiovascular risk compared to those with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, while people with schizoaffective disorder had the highest 30-year cardiovascular risk when compared to the other two groups.

Smoking and body mass index (BMI) accounted for much of the risk factors contributing to cardiovascular disease in those with a serious mental illness: those with a serious mental illness were three times more likely to be current smokers (36%) compared to peers without serious mental illness (12%), and 50% of those with a serious mental illness met the criteria for obesity compared to 36% of people without a serious mental illness.

People with a serious mental illness had double the rate of diagnosed diabetes (Type 1 or Type 2) than people without serious mental illness (14% vs. 7%, respectively).

15% of adults with a serious mental illness had high blood pressure vs. 13% of those without a serious mental illness.

“Even at younger ages, people with serious mental illness had a higher risk of heart disease than their peers, which highlights the importance of addressing cardiovascular risk factors for these individuals as early as possible,” Rossom said. “Interventions to address heart disease risk for these individuals are maximally beneficial when initiated at younger ages.

“We encourage health care systems and clinicians to use the 30-year cardiovascular risk estimates for young adults with serious mental illness, as these may be used starting at age 18,” she said. “Right now, estimates of 10-year heart disease risk are used most frequently, and they cannot be applied until people are at least 40 years old, which is too late to start addressing heart disease risk in people with serious mental illness.”

The study has also analyzed the impact of age, gender, and racial/ethnic variations on the infection rate and severity. The detailed findings of the research are currently available on the medRxiv* preprint server.

*Important notice: medRxiv publishes preliminary scientific reports that are not peer-reviewed and, therefore, should not be regarded as conclusive, guide clinical practice/health-related behavior, or treated as established information.

Background

The most recently emerged omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 has caused a sharp induction in infection rates worldwide, indicating the transmission advantage of the variant. Studies conducted in real-world setups have highlighted the potency of the variant in causing breakthrough infections in previously-infected or vaccinated persons. In addition, genome sequencing studies have indicated that a heavily mutated spike protein of the omicron variant might be responsible for its improved immune fitness.

In the current retrospective cohort study, the scientists have analyzed an extensive, geographically-diverse database of patients in the US to compare the infection rates and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity in patients infected with the omicron or delta variant. In addition, they have analyzed whether infection rate and disease severity vary with patient’s age, gender, and ethnicity.

Study design

The study was conducted on a large cohort of 881,473 patients who developed SARS-CoV-2 infection between September 2021 and January 2022. The patients who developed an infection during the omicron-dominated wave (147,964 patients) or delta-dominated wave (633,581 patients) were included in the study. In addition, about 99,928 patients who developed infection just before the detection of the omicron variant in the US were included.

Monthly incidence rates and disease severity were assessed and stratified by patients’ age groups, gender, and race/ethnicity. The disease severity assessment included emergency department visits, hospitalizations, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and requirement of mechanical ventilation.

Infection rates during omicron and delta waves

The monthly incidence rate of COVID-19 was determined by measuring the number of new cases per 1000 individuals per day. During the delta-dominated wave, the incidence rate was 0.5 – 0.7, which increased rapidly to 3.8 – 5.2 during the omicron-dominated wave.

In January 2022, when the omicron variant was predominant, the highest incidence rate was observed among children under the age of 5 years. The rate was 6 – 9 times higher than during the delta-dominated wave. Notably, a reduction in the incidence rate was observed with increasing age. The patients aged 65 years and above showed the lowest incidence rate during the omicron-dominated wave.

Regarding racial and ethnic variation, Black and Hispanic patients showed higher incidence rates than White and non-Hispanic patients during both delta-dominated and omicron-dominated waves. However, the racial variation was more pronounced during the omicron wave.

​​​​​​​

Comparison of ED visits, hospitalization, ICU admission in the 3-day time-window that followed from the first day of SARS-CoV-2 infection between matched Black vs White patients, Hispanic vs non-Hispanic patients, women vs men in the Omicron, Delta, and Delta-2 cohorts, respectively. Race, ethnicity, or gender stratified cohorts were propensity-score matched for other demographics, socioeconomic factors, COVID-19-related health conditions, medications, and documented vaccination status.

Disease severity during omicron and delta waves

Significantly lower disease severity was observed during the omicron wave compared to that during the delta wave. This trend was observed in all age groups except for the 5 – 17 years.

The patients infected during the initial period of the delta wave had a higher rate of severe outcomes than those infected afterward (just before the initiation of the omicron wave). This could be because of waning vaccine efficacy, as mentioned by the scientists.

Compared to White and non-Hispanic patients, Black and Hispanic patients showed a significantly higher rate of emergency department visits during both delta and omicron waves. A similar racial/ethnic variation was observed for the rate of ICU admissions. However, no significant racial/ethnic variation was observed for hospitalization rates.

Regarding gender variation, female patients showed lower rates of emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and ICU admissions than male patients during both delta and omicron waves.

Study significance

The study reveals that the incidence rate of omicron infections is 6 – 8 times higher than that of delta infections in the United States. Omicron infections are associated with less severe outcomes than delta infections despite high transmissibility. For both delta and omicron infections, significant ethnic/racial and gender variations in disease severity have been observed in the study.

Equally concerning was a tripling in 2021 of the number of cases that were resistant to echinocandins, the antifungal medicine most recommended for treatment of C. auris infections. In general, C. auris is not a threat to healthy people. People who are very sick, have invasive medical devices, or have long or frequent stays in healthcare facilities are at increased risk for acquiring C. auris. CDC has deemed C. auris as an urgent AR threat, because it is often resistant to multiple antifungal drugs, spreads easily in healthcare facilities, and can cause severe infections with high death rates.

“The rapid rise and geographic spread of cases is concerning and emphasizes the need for continued surveillance, expanded lab capacity, quicker diagnostic tests, and adherence to proven infection prevention and control,” said CDC epidemiologist Dr. Meghan Lyman, lead author of the paper.

As further explained in the article, C. auris has spread in the United States since it was first reported in 2016, with a total of 3,270 clinical cases (in which infection is present) and 7,413 screening cases (in which the fungus is detected but not causing infection) reported through December 31, 2021. Clinical cases have increased each year since 2016, with the most rapid rise occurring during 2020-2021. CDC has continued to see an increase in case counts for 2022. During 2019-2021, 17 states identified their first C. auris case ever. Nationwide, clinical cases rose from 476 in 2019 to 1,471 in 2021. Screening cases tripled from 2020 to 2021, for a total of 4,041. Screening is important to prevent spread by identifying patients carrying the fungus so that infection prevention controls can be used.

C. auris case counts have increased for many reasons, including poor general infection prevention and control (IPC) practices in healthcare facilities. Case counts may also have increased because of enhanced efforts to detect cases, including increased colonization screening, a test to see if someone has the fungus somewhere on their body but does not have an infection or symptoms of infection. The timing of this increase and findings from public health investigations suggest C. auris spread may have worsened due to strain on healthcare and public health systems during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The CDC’s Antimicrobial Resistance Laboratory Network, which provides nationwide lab capacity to rapidly detect antimicrobial resistance and inform local responses to prevent spread and protect people, provided some of the data for this report. CDC worked to significantly strengthen laboratory capacity, including in state, territorial, and local health departments, through supplemental funding supported by the American Rescue Plan Act. These efforts include increasing susceptibility testing capacity for C. auris from seven Regional Labs to more than 26 labs nationwide.

CDC continues to work with state, local, and territorial health departments and other partners to address this emerging threat to public health.

This is lower than the current coverage by insurers, most of whom foot policyholders’ bills “as charged” with the usual deductible and co-payment borne by patients.

This change will apply to all policyholders from the time they renew their IP contract. From what the seven IP insurers indicate, their coverage will be from April 1, and the maximum amount will apply to all plans, regardless of whether they are pegged at public sector B1 or A class wards, or private sector care.

Those who are already being treated for cancer will have their current coverage extended for six months to allow them to complete their regimen.

This is the second phase of the move by the Ministry of Health (MOH) to slow the spiralling cost of cancer treatments here – which has been growing at 20 per cent a year – and to obtain better pricing for cancer drugs. The first phase started in September 2022 and affected people who are on only the basic MediShield Life.

MOH said it hopes these changes “will keep cancer treatments and insurance premiums affordable in the longer term”.

There are two parts to the changes.

The first restricts insurance coverage to only cancer treatments on the Cancer Drug List. According to MOH, about 90 per cent of cancer drug treatments approved for use by the Health Sciences Authority, which regulates the use of medication here, are on this list.

Only drugs that have been clinically proven to be effective as well as provide value for money are included. Health Minister Ong Ye Kung has said that if pharmaceutical companies are willing to reduce the price of their drugs so they do provide good value, those drugs would also be added to the list.

As a result of this move, cancer drug prices have dropped by an average of 30 per cent for the public sector, with some falling by as much as 60 per cent. This has so far not been reflected in the private sector.

The second change involves splitting the insurance coverage of cancer care into drugs and services.

For MediShield Life, the amount that drugs can be covered by insurance ranges from $200 to $9,600 a month, depending on the drug used. For IPs, coverage at five times would come to a maximum of $1,000 to $48,000 a month.

The insurance can pay for only the most expensive drug used when more than one drug on the Cancer Drug List is prescribed. If it is a combination therapy that is on the list, all the drugs in the combination will be covered up to the $9,600 a month cap.

For cancer services, MediShield Life pays up to $1,200 a year now. This will be raised to $3,600 from Saturday, a change made by the MOH in response to feedback since the scheme was launched in September 2022 that $1,200 was too low to cover the costs for significant numbers of subsidised patients.

Cancer services include everything other than drugs, such as consultation fees, tests and supportive drugs that treat nausea or infections caused by the treatment.

Patients on IPs will be covered up to a maximum of $18,000 a year, or about $1,500 a month.

Oncologists in private practice, whose patients will be the most affected by the changes, are concerned that the coverage would not be enough unless the patients have also bought riders to cover a large part of their portion of medical bills – that is, the compulsory deductible and co-payment.","SINGAPORE - From April 1, Integrated Shield Plans (IPs) will pay up to a maximum of five times the amount of coverage for cancer treatments that the basic MediShield Life does.

The ending of ties with Taiwan had been long expected after the Honduran foreign minister travelled to China last week to open relations and President Xiomara Castro said her government would start ties with Beijing.

China said its foreign minister, Qin Gang, and Honduran Foreign Minister Eduardo Enrique Reina signed the deal on diplomatic recognition in Beijing, ending relations with Taiwan dating back to the 1940s.

In a brief statement late on Saturday, the Honduran foreign ministry said it recognised the People's Republic of China as the only legitimate government that represents all of China and that Taiwan is an ""inseparable part of Chinese territory"".

China claims democratically ruled Taiwan as its own territory with no right to state-to-state ties, a position Taipei strongly rejects. China demands that countries with which it has ties to recognise its position.

Speaking on Sunday in Taipei shortly after the announcement, Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu said Castro, who took office early last year, and her government had ""always had illusions"" about China and China's ""luring"" had never stopped.

""The foreign ministry and embassy grasped the relevant information and handled it carefully. However, the Castro government also asked us for billions of dollars in huge economic assistance and compared prices for assistance programmes provided by Taiwan and China,"" Wu said.

Neither the Chinese nor the Honduran statements made mention of aid.

Wu added that the Honduran foreign minister wrote to Taiwan on Mar 13, the day before Castro's original announcement, demanding a total of US$2.45 billion in aid, including the construction of a hospital and a dam and to write off debt.

""It felt like what they wanted was money, not a hospital,"" Wu said.

Honduras Foreign Minister Eduardo Enrique Reina told Reuters last week the US$2.5 billion figure was ""not a donation"", but rather ""a negotiated refinancing mechanism"".

PROMISES

Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen is due to depart on a sensitive visit to the United States, Guatemala and Belize on Wednesday. She is expected to meet US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in Los Angeles at the end of the trip.

Wu said he was ""highly suspicious"" of the timing of the Honduran decision so close to Tsai's overseas tour.

""China seems to be doing this intentionally,"" he said.

The United States has been watching with concern as China expands its footprint in its backyard by taking away Taiwan's Central American allies, and has repeatedly warned countries not to believe China's promises of aid.

The US State Department said while the Honduran action was a sovereign decision, it was important to note China ""often makes promises in exchange for diplomatic recognition that ultimately remain unfulfilled"".

""Regardless of Honduras' decision, the United States will continue to deepen and expand our engagement with Taiwan,"" it said in a statement.

Relations between Honduras and Taiwan date back to 1941 when the government of the Republic of China, which remains Taiwan's official name, was still in China before it fled to the island in 1949 after losing a civil war with the Mao Zedong's communists.

Taiwan now only has formal diplomatic relations with 13 countries, mostly poor and developing countries in Central America, the Caribbean and the Pacific.","BEIJING: China established diplomatic ties with Honduras on Sunday (Mar 26) after the Central American country ended its decades-long relationship with Taiwan, as Taiwan's foreign minister accused Honduras of demanding exorbitant sums before being lured away by Beijing.

307,307,https://www.healthline.com/health/crohns-disease/manage-hospital-costs,Manage the Cost of Crohn's Disease-Related Hospital Stays,"Crohn’s disease is a type of inflammatory bowel disease that causes inflammation in the digestive tract. Symptoms can include abdominal pain, diarrhea, anemia, weight loss, and fatigue. It’s a lifelong condition, and these symptoms may come and go. Managing Crohn’s disease often involves lifestyle changes, medication, and frequent checkups with a gastroenterologist, a digestive health specialist. It can also involve surgical procedures, emergency room visits, hospitalization. In fact, hospital visits are common in people living with Crohn’s disease. And the cost of these visits can add up. Here’s what you need to know about managing the cost of hospital stays, including how to prevent a hospitalization.

Why is hospitalization common in people with Crohn’s disease? The severity of Crohn’s disease can vary from person to person. The risk of hospitalization is lower in those who have more mild symptoms. However, the risk increases with severe flares. The reason for hospitalization can also vary from person to person. Factors that can trigger a hospital stay include: Dehydration Diarrhea is a common symptom of Crohn’s disease. Inflammation in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract can cause persistent diarrhea. This can cause your body to lose a large amount of fluid and increase the risk of dehydration. Dehydration is when your body doesn’t have enough water. Severe dehydration is serious and requires immediate attention. It often requires a visit to a medical facility for an IV to restore lost fluids. The first sign of mild dehydration is typically thirst, which may be accompanied by dry mouth, headache, and tiredness. Symptoms of severe dehydration can include dizziness, muscle cramps, confusion, and a rapid pulse. Severe intestinal bleeding Rectal bleeding is another symptom of Crohn’s disease. It’s not uncommon to detect blood in the stool. Bleeding is sometimes due to a hemorrhoid or a tear in the lining of the anus. Bloody stool can also be a sign of internal bleeding in the GI tract. Inflammation can damage the lining of blood vessels, which causes bleeding and can lead to anemia. Surgery is sometimes necessary to repair a bleeding vessel. Other intestinal complications Crohn’s disease can also lead to other complications like an intestinal obstruction. This occurs when the bowel wall thickens and the intestinal passage narrows. Taking medication to reduce inflammation can help reverse an obstruction. But in severe cases, surgery is necessary. Surgery and hospitalization can also occur if a fistula develops in the GI tract. This is an abnormal connection between two body parts due to inflammation, such as the colon and bladder.

How expensive are hospital stays for Crohn’s disease? The total lifetime cost of hospitalization varies from person to person, depending on the severity of symptoms as well as the age of diagnosis. According to one study , the average lifetime cost of inpatient care for Crohn’s disease in the United States is $164,298. Along with inpatient care, people living with Crohn’s spend (on average) a lifetime total of $20,979 for emergency room visits. Another study looking at Americans living with Crohn’s disease over the course of 5 years found that 67 percent of their health expenses were related to hospitalizations. Even with health insurance, hospital stays can result in significant out-of-pocket costs. You’ll likely have a deductible, which is what you’ll pay out-of-pocket before your insurance provider pays a claim. You might also have coinsurance, which is the percent you pay for healthcare services after paying your deductible.

How to manage the cost of hospital stays for Crohn’s disease These strategies can help you manage these costs and reduce the likelihood of a hospital visit. 1. Ask about financial assistance Many hospital systems have financial assistance programs to help people cover some of their healthcare costs. Some programs are only available to those who don’t have health insurance. Other programs are available whether you have coverage or not. Each hospital has its own policies, you’ll need to speak directly with the facility’s financial assistance office. You might be eligible for discounted care depending on your household income. If you’re not eligible for a discount, you may be able to set up an interest-free payment plan. 2. Get an itemized bill Hospital billing errors can happen. Request an itemized statement before making any payment. Contact the hospital’s billing department if you don’t recognize a charge, notice a duplicate charge, or have any questions about the charges overall. 3. Choose an in-network surgeon Contact your health insurance company to find in-network medical professionals, including a surgeon who can perform any procedures necessary. Using an out-of-network surgeon (or hospital) can result in additional out-of-pocket costs. Some health plans will not cover out-of-network healthcare services, meaning you could end up paying for a procedure on your own. 4. Sign up for health savings Ask your employer about benefits like a health savings account (HSA) or flexible spending account (FSA). These programs allow you to set aside money before taxes to be used to help cover the cost of healthcare expenses. Many HSA or FSA programs can be applied toward emergency department visits, surgical procedures, and hospital stays. Putting pre-tax money into these accounts helps you produce overall savings. 5. Take steps to prevent a hospital visit Crohn’s disease can be unpredictable. But keeping inflammation and flares under control can help prevent hospitalization. Make sure you: Follow your treatment plan as prescribed. Medications like aminosalicylates, immunomodulators, or biologics can reduce inflammation in your colon and lower the frequency of flares.

Medications like aminosalicylates, immunomodulators, or biologics can reduce inflammation in your colon and lower the frequency of flares. Adapt your diet. Crohn’s disease symptoms may worsen after consuming certain foods and drinks (alcohol, spicy foods, dairy). There’s no exact Crohn’s diet. But identifying your food triggers and taking steps to avoid them can help reduce the risk of flares and complications.

Smoking can also worsen symptoms of Crohn’s disease. Avoiding smoking as well as exposure to secondhand smoke can lead to fewer flares.

Smoking can also worsen symptoms of Crohn’s disease. Avoiding smoking as well as exposure to secondhand smoke can lead to fewer flares. Communicate with your doctor. Don’t skip any follow-up appointments with your gastroenterologist, even if you’re feeling well. Contact your doctor if any symptoms worsen or don’t respond to medication. These are signs your treatment plan may need adjusting to help decrease inflammation in the GI tract.","Factors that can trigger a hospital stay include: Dehydration Diarrhea is a common symptom of Crohn’s disease.

Navy salvage crews operating from a commercial salvage ship have recovered the F-35C Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter that suffered a ramp strike on the deck of USS Carl Vinson (CVN-70 and crashed into the South China Sea, a U.S. 7th Fleet spokesman confirmed to USNI News on Thursday.

The F-35C, assigned to the “Argonauts” of VFA-147 Strike Fighter Squadron (VFA), was plucked from the floor of the South China Sea with Navy personnel aboard the offshore vessel DSCV Picasso, which had departed Okinawa on Feb. 23, according to the service.

The Navy sent personnel from Task Force 75, Naval Sea Systems Command and NAVSEA’s Supervisor of Salvage and Diving aboard Picasso – a vessel designed for deep diving and salvage for offshore industries, according to owner Ultra Deep Solutions.

“The wreckage was recovered from a depth of approximately 12,400-feet by a team from CTF 75 and the NAVSEA’s Supervisor of Salvage and Diving (SUPSALV) embarked on the diving support construction vessel (DSCV) Picasso,” reads a statement from U.S. 7th Fleet.

“The aircraft was recovered using a CURV-21, a remotely operated vehicle (ROV), which attached specialized rigging and lift lines to the aircraft. The ship’s crane lifting hook was then lowered to the seafloor and connected to the rigging, and then lifted the aircraft to the surface and hoisted it onboard Picasso.”

Recovery of the aircraft eases fears that China or Russia could seize the aircraft, either to replicate the technology aboard or discover ways to defeat the fighters.

While the Navy did not specify where the recovery operations occurred, the Japan Coast Guard issued a notice to mariners in late January warning of salvage operations about 170 miles west of the Philippine island of Luzon.

The recovery of the F-35C follows a similar operation in which the United Kingdom, Italy and the United States mounted a salvage operation last year for a U.K. F-35B that crashed into the Mediterranean following a take-off from carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth (R08).

According to a video of the ramp strike that was leaked on social media, the F-35C was too low in its approach to the flight deck and struck the rear of the carrier, skidding on its belly and rotating 180 degrees while heading down the angled deck of Vinson.

The fighter slid across the deck at about 95 miles per hour before falling off the edge. The crash, which occurred on Jan. 24, injured seven sailors, including the pilot who was able to eject from the fighter before it hit the water.

The crew of Vinson was able to quickly clear the flight during a combined exercise with fighters from USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72). Some fighters were able to refuel on Lincoln before returning to Vinson the same day.

“One of the super rewarding …. feelings or emotions, results of the, specifically the F-35 crash, but also the…other incidents [is] the way the ship’s crew and the air wing came together and provided the perfect response,” Capt. P. Scott Miller, told USNI News on a recent embark aboard Vinson. “Our entire training track, where we do our workups with all of the training organizations back home – prepared us perfectly.”

The cause of the crash is currently under investigation.

The following is the complete statement from U.S. 7th Fleet.

YOKOSUKA, Japan –

U.S. 7th Fleet’s Task Force (CTF) 75 and Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) successfully retrieved the F-35C Lightning II aircraft which crashed earlier this year in the South China Sea, March 2.

The F-35C Lightning II, assigned to Carrier Air Wing (CVW) 2, crashed while USS Carl Vinson (CVN 70) was conducting routine flight operations in the South China Sea on Jan. 24.

The wreckage was recovered from a depth of approximately 12,400-feet by a team from CTF 75 and the NAVSEA’s Supervisor of Salvage and Diving (SUPSALV) embarked on the diving support construction vessel (DSCV) Picasso.

“The task force’s expertise in rapid, scalable command, control, and communications, agile logistics, organic security, and explosive ordnance disposal was the most flexible choice for the fleet commander to respond in a timely manner,” said CTF 75 Commodore, Capt. Gareth Healy.

“Ultimately, this deliberate approach resulted in the correct capabilities conducting recovery operations within 37 days of the incident. Given the unique challenges of this problem and the unique technical capabilities that NAVSEA delivered, this was an aggressive and achievable timeline.”

The aircraft was recovered using a CURV-21, a remotely operated vehicle (ROV), which attached specialized rigging and lift lines to the aircraft. The ship’s crane lifting hook was then lowered to the seafloor and connected to the rigging, and then lifted the aircraft to the surface and hoisted it onboard Picasso.

The aircraft will be delivered to a nearby military installation to aid in the ongoing investigation and evaluated for potential transport to the United States.

The recovery effort shows the U.S. Navy commitment to its assets, and a free and open Indo-Pacific.

CTF 75 is 7th Fleet’s primary expeditionary task force and is responsible for the planning and execution of maritime security operations, explosive ordnance disposal, diving, engineering and construction, and underwater construction. It additionally provides direct support to diving and salvage operations and expeditionary intelligence throughout the Indo-Asia-Pacific region.

310,310,https://news.mit.edu/2022/polymer-lightweight-material-2d-0202,New lightweight material is stronger than steel,"Using a novel polymerization process, MIT chemical engineers have created a new material that is stronger than steel and as light as plastic, and can be easily manufactured in large quantities.

The new material is a two-dimensional polymer that self-assembles into sheets, unlike all other polymers, which form one-dimensional, spaghetti-like chains. Until now, scientists had believed it was impossible to induce polymers to form 2D sheets.

Such a material could be used as a lightweight, durable coating for car parts or cell phones, or as a building material for bridges or other structures, says Michael Strano, the Carbon P. Dubbs Professor of Chemical Engineering at MIT and the senior author of the new study.

“We don’t usually think of plastics as being something that you could use to support a building, but with this material, you can enable new things,” he says. “It has very unusual properties and we’re very excited about that.”

The researchers have filed for two patents on the process they used to generate the material, which they describe in a paper appearing today in Nature. MIT postdoc Yuwen Zeng is the lead author of the study.

Two dimensions

Polymers, which include all plastics, consist of chains of building blocks called monomers. These chains grow by adding new molecules onto their ends. Once formed, polymers can be shaped into three-dimensional objects, such as water bottles, using injection molding.

Polymer scientists have long hypothesized that if polymers could be induced to grow into a two-dimensional sheet, they should form extremely strong, lightweight materials. However, many decades of work in this field led to the conclusion that it was impossible to create such sheets. One reason for this was that if just one monomer rotates up or down, out of the plane of the growing sheet, the material will begin expanding in three dimensions and the sheet-like structure will be lost.

However, in the new study, Strano and his colleagues came up with a new polymerization process that allows them to generate a two-dimensional sheet called a polyaramide. For the monomer building blocks, they use a compound called melamine, which contains a ring of carbon and nitrogen atoms. Under the right conditions, these monomers can grow in two dimensions, forming disks. These disks stack on top of each other, held together by hydrogen bonds between the layers, which make the structure very stable and strong.

“Instead of making a spaghetti-like molecule, we can make a sheet-like molecular plane, where we get molecules to hook themselves together in two dimensions,” Strano says. “This mechanism happens spontaneously in solution, and after we synthesize the material, we can easily spin-coat thin films that are extraordinarily strong.”

Because the material self-assembles in solution, it can be made in large quantities by simply increasing the quantity of the starting materials. The researchers showed that they could coat surfaces with films of the material, which they call 2DPA-1.

“With this advance, we have planar molecules that are going to be much easier to fashion into a very strong, but extremely thin material,” Strano says.

Light but strong

The researchers found that the new material’s elastic modulus — a measure of how much force it takes to deform a material — is between four and six times greater than that of bulletproof glass. They also found that its yield strength, or how much force it takes to break the material, is twice that of steel, even though the material has only about one-sixth the density of steel.

Matthew Tirrell, dean of the Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering at the University of Chicago, says that the new technique “embodies some very creative chemistry to make these bonded 2D polymers.”

“An important aspect of these new polymers is that they are readily processable in solution, which will facilitate numerous new applications where high strength to weight ratio is important, such as new composite or diffusion barrier materials,” says Tirrell, who was not involved in the study.

Another key feature of 2DPA-1 is that it is impermeable to gases. While other polymers are made from coiled chains with gaps that allow gases to seep through, the new material is made from monomers that lock together like LEGOs, and molecules cannot get between them.

“This could allow us to create ultrathin coatings that can completely prevent water or gases from getting through,” Strano says. “This kind of barrier coating could be used to protect metal in cars and other vehicles, or steel structures.”

Strano and his students are now studying in more detail how this particular polymer is able to form 2D sheets, and they are experimenting with changing its molecular makeup to create other types of novel materials.

The research was funded by the Center for Enhanced Nanofluidic Transport (CENT) an Energy Frontier Research Center sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science, and the Army Research Laboratory.","Using a novel polymerization process, MIT chemical engineers have created a new material that is stronger than steel and as light as plastic, and can be easily manufactured in large quantities.

As a result, infections like COVID-19 are expected to spike, positioning Ukraine for a health crisis as they simultaneously defend against invasion.

“Viruses and bacteria are happy to exploit those situations where human beings are put under pressure,” Máire Connolly, a global health professor at the National University of Ireland Galway, told The Washington Post. She referenced overcrowding and a lack of food, water, and sanitation as factors driving the “double crisis” of war and disease.

With COVID-19 testing, vaccination, and treatment interrupted by the attacks, Ukraine will “without a doubt” see a rise in cases, said the World Health Organization (WHO). Before the war began, approximately 35% of the Ukrainian population was vaccinated against COVID-19.

Earlier this week, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, MD, the director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO) gave a statement on how the organization is supporting Ukraine. Ghebreyesus said the WHO has so far delivered 81 metric tons of supplies to Ukraine and is working to establish a supply pipeline for the country’s health facilities.

As of March 8, the director-general said, “We delivered five metric tons of medical supplies to Kyiv to support surgical care for 150 trauma patients, and other supplies to manage a range of health conditions for 45000 people for a month.” He added that more supplies were delivered on the following day, March 9, including 400 cubic meters of supplies transported from WHO’s hub in Dubai.

Still, Ukrainian hospitals are running out of supplies, and healthcare workers have their own safety to consider. The WHO has now verified 18 attacks against health workers, health facilities, and ambulances.

“Sending supplies to hospitals is great but those hospitals need power, they need clean water, they need engineers to be able to help, they need a fuel supply for generators,” said Michael Ryan, MD, the executive director of the WHO’s emergency program. “All of this infrastructure and engineering support is needed to keep your average hospital going in a normal situation. In the middle of a shooting war, it is almost impossible.”

The WHO promised to support neighboring countries as they provide healthcare to Ukrainian refugees. “Some of the main health challenges we see are hypothermia and frostbite, respiratory diseases, lack of treatment for cardiovascular diseases and cancer, and mental health issues.”

However, Ryan emphasized that accepting refugees would not drive infectious disease outbreaks in neighboring countries. “Europe has plenty of COVID as it stands,” he said, “The Ukrainian refugees are not going to change the dial on that.”

In addition to an impending COVID-19 outbreak, other significant Ukrainian health concerns include vaccine-derived polio, measles, and cholera.

“But the only real solution to this situation is peace,” Ghebreyesus said. “WHO continues to call on the Russian Federation to commit to a peaceful resolution to this crisis and to allow safe, unimpeded access to humanitarian assistance for those in need. A peaceful resolution is possible and that’s true in every war and humanitarian crisis to which WHO is responding around the world.”","As Russia continues waging war on Ukraine, people are forced to shelter in compact spaces with limited airflow.

‘Never give up’

Speaking to journalists after this evening's Council meeting, Secretary-General António Guterres, stressed that while the United Nations had today not achieved its primary objective to end war, “we must never give up.”

“We must give peace another chance. Soldiers need to return to their barracks. Leaders need to turn to the path of dialogue and peace,” he said.

And despite growing operational challenges, he assured that the UN is scaling up the delivery of life-saving support on both sides of the line of contact.

Dedicated UN coordinator

Against the backdrop of multiplying humanitarian needs, dying civilians and at least 100,000 Ukrainians reportedly fleeing their homes – with many crossing into neighbouring countries, underlining the regional nature of this growing crisis – Mr. Guterres announced the appointment of Amin Awad as UN Crisis Coordinator for Ukraine.

A close colleague of Mr. Guterres when he was chief of the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, Mr. Awad will lead the coordination of all UN efforts, including its humanitarian response, on both sides of the contact line.

“All concerned in this conflict must respect international humanitarian law and guarantee the safety and freedom of movement of UN staff and other humanitarians. Especially in a moment like this, it is important to remember that the UN…is tens of thousands of women and men around the world,” he said.

Overcoming challenges

The top UN official outlined the work of the Organization, from feeding the hungry, vaccinating children and promoting development to protecting civilians in peacekeeping operations, mediating conflicts and supporting refugees and migrants, all while “standing, delivering, extending a lifeline of hope.’”

He stressed that although the UN Charter has been challenged in the past, it has “stood firm on the side of peace, security, development, justice, international law and human rights”.

“Time after time, when the international community has rallied together in solidarity, those values have prevailed. They will prevail, independently of what happened today,” the UN chief said.

“We must do everything in our power so that they prevail in Ukraine but they prevail for all humanity,” concluded the Secretary-General.

""We have a solemn responsibility not to look away,"" she said stressing that Russia must be held accountable, and its forces immediately, completely and unconditionally withdrawn.

“Today we are taking a principled stand in this Council,” Ms. Thomas-Greenfield said. “There is no middle ground,” responsible States do not invade their neighbours.

Can't veto accountability

After the text was defeated, Ms. Thomas-Greenfield took the floor again.

“You can veto this resolution, but you cannot veto our voices; You cannot veto the truth; You cannot veto our principles; You cannot veto the Ukrainian people; cannot veto the UN Charter…and you will not veto accountability,” she underscored.

The US Ambassador said that despite the actions of a ""reckless, irresponsible"" Member State, the United States will continue to stand with Ukraine against Russia’s aggression.

‘Naked aggression’

UK Ambassador Dame Barbara Woodward described how women and children in Kyiv, pensioners in Odessa and people all over Ukraine are “sheltering from Russia’s onslaught.”

She stated that the draft resolution sent ""a message to the world that the rules we built together must be defended, because otherwise, who will be next.”

Moreover, President Vladimir Putin’s “massive invasion"" of Ukraine to remove the Government is ""a naked aggression” that must be condemned, Ms. Woodward added.

After the vote, the UK Ambassador pointed out that Russia was the only Council Member to vote against the draft.

“Make no mistake, Russia is isolated, it has no support for the invasion of Ukraine,” she said, noting that history would record what had happened today, and that the United Kingdom “stands firmly in support” of the Ukrainian people and would hold Russia accountable for its actions.

A veto against international law

After voting in favour of the resolution, France’s Ambassador, Nicolas de Rivière, said that Russia’s “premediated aggression” is killing civilians and destroying infrastructure with goal of rebuilding the Russian empire.

While other members expressed their commitment to international law, Russia vetoed it.

“Russia is alone,” he observed, adding that “within the UN and in all bodies, France will continue to mobilize with its partners to support Ukraine and the Ukrainian people.”

Abstentions

Indian Ambassador T. S. Tirumurti, who abstained, said that “dialogue is the only path forward,” no matter how daunting it might seem, and urged the Council to restore the difficult path forward.

Also abstaining, UAE Ambassador Lana Nusseibeh said that now that the resolution has been vetoed, the United Arab Emirates would continue to seek “inclusive and consultative processes” for a path forward.

Not an outpost

Meanwhile, as the only Permanent Council member to abstain, Chinese Ambassador Zhang Jun warned against actions that might “shut the door” to a negotiated settlement. He reminded that the Ukraine crisis did not occur “overnight” and that the security of one State cannot come at the expense of that of others.

“Ukraine should become a bridge between East and West, not an outpost,” he said, adding that that cold war mentalities must be abandoned to build balanced European mechanisms and all parties should return to diplomacy.

‘Ukrainian chessboard’

Russian Ambassador Vasily Nebenzya said that he would not respond to those who had accused him of abusing his country's veto power.

He accused the draft’s sponsors of “spinning tales” about the true situation in Ukraine, including Western allies’ attempts to cover up the fact that they had been flooding the Donbas with weapons.

“You have made Ukraine a pawn in your own game… this resolution is nothing other than yet another brutal, inhumane move on this Ukrainian chessboard,” he said.

Indeed, the situation is being exploited by political and media outlets, he said, citing examples of the “height of propaganda”, including the misuse of images from Donbas to portray what was being referred to as Russian aggression.""

Speaking to the representatives of France, the UK and US, he said that there was no verifiable confirmation about the death of Ukrainian civilians; that photographs of supposed Russian artillery “is fake”; and that reports of attacks on civilian infrastructure were untrue.

Moreover, with its history of aggressions against other countries, the United States was “in no position to moralize.”

‘A seat in Hell’

Ukraine Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya asserted that he would not dignify the “diabolical script” read by the Russian Ambassador, which was in fact “a rather detailed application for... a seat in Hell.”

He recalled that during the Security Council's discussions on the situation in Ukraine earlier in the week, Russia had begun bombing his country and sending forces across the border, including through Belarus.

Therefore, he was not surprised that Russia voted against the text, he said, denouncing the actions of “the Kremlin regime.”

Mr. Kyslytsya asked the Council to remember how many times the Russian Ambassador said that his country would not invade or bomb Ukraine. But after what had happened in recent days, “how can we trust you? You have no idea what is in the mind of your President,” he declared.

The Ukraine Ambassador also noted that according to the rules of procedure, the Russian Ambassador should not have been presiding over a meeting of which his country was the subject.

Silent moment for peace

The Ukraine Ambassador asked the Council to dedicate a moment of silence “for peace… and to pray for the souls of those that have already been or may be killed”, inviting the Russian Ambassador to “pray for salvation.”

This was followed by solemn applause throughout the Chamber.

Noting that nothing could justify the bombing of hospitals and kindergartens –considered war crimes under the Rome Statute – he said that Ukraine was collecting evidence to send forward to the International Criminal Court (ICC).

Sever ties

Finally, Mr. Kyslytsya called on nations to break off diplomatic relations with the Russian Federation, and international organizations to sever ties with that country.

“You should stop wiping your feet” on the words of the Secretary-General and the work of the UN, and “show respect for the principles enshrined in the Charter,” he said.

In closing, the Ambassador maintained that while Ukraine remained open to negotiations, it was Russia that had launched an offensive that had sent “thousands of troops” into its territory.","A ‘no’ vote from any one of the five permanent members of the Council stops action on any measure put before it.

316,316,https://www.unr.edu/nevada-today/news/2022/tick-transformation-breakthrough,Gene-editing breakthrough made in the battle against tick-borne diseases,"Finding a solution

Gulia-Nuss’s work has attracted the attention of the Congressionally established Tick-Borne Disease Working Group, which invited her to present her public-impact research and pioneering findings at their most recent meeting on Dec. 8, 2021. She described this as a “great experience” where she could elaborate on how the methods they are developing can lead to new and significant developments in the tick research space.

“This is the first time ticks have been modified in any way on the genetic level, so that was really interesting for the committee,” said Gulia-Nuss. “The committee members wanted to hear more about [our group’s] work and how this could be applicable to different areas of tick-borne disease research.”

Together Gulia-Nuss’ and Andrew Nuss’ labs are the first to develop the embryo injection protocol for gene editing for ticks. With this new development, researchers can start editing any gene in the genome, allowing them to ask questions that were not possible to answer before. For example, when editing or removing certain genes, they can examine what happens to the tick and if this alteration interferes with the pathogen development in a way that makes it harmless to humans.

The discovery did not come without its challenges. A major struggle that Gulia-Nuss described was developing a way to inject tick eggs. Ticks are unique because they put a large amount of wax on their eggs, and that wax must be removed before the researchers can successfully inject the embryo without killing the egg. Collaboration with Robert Harrell, of the University of Maryland and an expert in insect embryo injections, was important for finding appropriate injection conditions for tick embryos.

“By modifying ticks at a genetic level to try to reduce the incidence of Lyme disease, Monika and her collaborators provide an excellent example of the kind of groundbreaking research we do at this University to have real impact on a public health issue. We’re grateful to have them on our team,"" said Bill Payne, dean, College of Agriculture, Biotechnology & Natural Resources.

The solution came about during a collaborative visit by Harrell to the University of Nevada, Reno, during which he, Gulia-Nuss and Andrew Nuss considered tick biology and a gland in ticks that produces the wax and covers the eggs in it. They hypothesized that if they could remove the gland, their wax problem would be solved. This ended up being correct, resulting in a “technological breakthrough,” Gulia-Nuss said.

Andrew Nuss said learning from others’ past research on genetic transformation played a huge role in their eventual breakthrough. He said that by looking at what has and hasn’t worked, their labs gained valuable insight that informed their research.

Gulia-Nuss hopes that as their labs continue to develop these methods, they will evolve enough where other labs outside of the University can easily use them. With the expertise and collaborative efforts of more researchers, more progress can be achieved in tick research, eventually reducing the tick-borne disease threat.

“Together we stand stronger,” she said.","Finding a solutionGulia-Nuss’s work has attracted the attention of the Congressionally established Tick-Borne Disease Working Group, which invited her to present her public-impact research and pioneering findings at their most recent meeting on Dec. 8, 2021.

317,317,https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/01/1109492,Afghanistan: UN launches largest single country aid appeal ever,"Speaking in Geneva, UN Emergency Relief Coordinator Martin Griffiths said that $4.4 billion was needed for the Afghanistan Humanitarian Response Plan alone, “to pay direct” to health workers and others, not the de facto authorities.

Tweet URL The UN made the largest ever humanitarian appeal for a single country.The money will go directly into the pockets of “nurses and health officials in the field in #Afghanistan ” so that these services can continue, not as support for State structures. https://t.co/itdxTbTIgc pic.twitter.com/ulFggdLuys UN News UN_News_Centre

UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi called for $623 million, to support refugees and host communities in five neighbouring countries, for the Afghanistan Situation Regional Refugee Response Plan.

“Today we are launching an appeal for $4.4 billion for Afghanistan itself for 2022,” said Mr. Griffiths. “This is the largest ever appeal for a single country for humanitarian assistance and it is three times the amount needed, and actually fundraised in 2021.”

Needs could double

The scale of need is already enormous, both UN officials stressed, warning that if insufficient action is taken now to support the Afghanistan and regional response plans, “next year we’ll be asking for $10 billion”.

Mr. Griffiths added: “This is a stop-gap, an absolutely essential stop-gap measure that we are putting in front of the international community today. Without this being funded, there won’t be a future, we need this to be done, otherwise there will be outflow, there will be suffering.”

Rejecting questions that the funding would be used to support the Taliban’s grip on de facto government, Mr. Griffiths insisted that it would go directly into the pockets of “nurses and health officials in the field” so that these services can continue, not as support for State structures.

UN aid agencies describe Afghanistan’s plight as one of the world’s most rapidly growing humanitarian crises.

According to UN humanitarian coordination office OCHA, half the population now faces acute hunger, over nine million people have been displaced and millions of children are out of school.

Youngsters’ plight

Asked to describe what might happen if sufficient support was not forthcoming, the UN emergency relief chief replied that he was particularly concerned for one million children now facing severe acute malnutrition. “A million children - figures are so hard so grasp when they’re this kind of size - but a million children at risk of that kind of malnutrition if these things don’t happen, is a shocking one.”

But humanitarian agencies and their partners who will receive the requested funding directly can only do so much, Mr. Griffiths explained, before reiterating his support for the 22 December UN Security Council resolution that cleared the way for aid to reach Afghans, while preventing funds from falling into the hands of the Taliban.

“Humanitarian agencies inside Afghanistan can only operate if there’s cash in the economy which can be used to pay officials, salaries, costs, fuel and so-forth,” he said. “So, liquidity in its first phase is a humanitarian issue, it’s not just a bigger economic issue.”

Stave off disease, hunger

He added: “My message is urgent: don’t shut the door on the people of Afghanistan. Humanitarian partners are on the ground, and they are delivering, despite the challenges. Help us scale up and stave off wide-spread hunger, disease, malnutrition and ultimately death by supporting the humanitarian plans we are launching today.”

Highlighting the need to avoid a wider regional crisis emanating from Afghanistan, UNHCR chief Grandi, insisted that what was needed most, was “to stabilize the situation inside Afghanistan, including that of displaced people who are displaced inside their country. Also, to prevent a larger refugee crisis, a larger crisis of external displacement.”

Nonetheless, Afghanistan’s immediate neighbours had sheltered vulnerable Afghans for decades, Mr. Grandi explained, as he appealed for $623 million in funding for 40 organizations working in protection, health and nutrition, food security, shelter and non-food items, water and sanitation, livelihoods and resilience, education, and logistics and telecoms.

Decades of shelter

No-one should forget “that there is a regional dimension to this crisis, represented by the Afghan refugees but also Afghans with many other ‘stay’ arrangements in neighbouring countries in particular,” Mr. Grandi said, “especially in Pakistan and Iran that have hosted Afghans for more than 40 years, but also Central Asian States.”

Since the Taliban takeover last August, women’s and girls’ rights have continued to come under attack, OCHA noted in a statement, “while farmers and herders are struggling amid the worst drought in decades and the economy is in freefall”.

Rights reminder

On the issue of protecting fundamental rights, Mr. Griffiths underlined the fact that UN humanitarians were continuing to hold “conversations” with Afghanistan’s de facto authorities at a national and sub-national level, on issues such as aid and education access for all.

Echoing that message, UN refugee chief Mr. Grandi noted that humanitarians on the ground were well aware of the importance of stressing the need to protect the rights of minorities and other vulnerable Afghans.

“Our colleagues are there every day, and that’s what they talk about every day; they certainly talk about access, and delivery and needs, but they also talk about women at work, women in school - girls in school - rights of minorities, but it’s that space that we need to preserve.”","Speaking in Geneva, UN Emergency Relief Coordinator Martin Griffiths said that $4.4 billion was needed for the Afghanistan Humanitarian Response Plan alone, “to pay direct” to health workers and others, not the de facto authorities.

The birds identified as having the disease, named plasticosis, have scarred digestive tracts from ingesting waste, scientists at the Natural History Museum in London say.

It is the first recorded instance of specifically plastic-induced fibrosis in wild animals, researchers say.

Plastic pollution is becoming so prevalent that the scarring was widespread across different ages of birds, according to the study, published in the Journal of Hazardous Materials.

Young birds were found to have the disease, and it is thought chicks were being fed the plastic pollution by parents accidentally bringing it back in food.

Scientists, including the Natural History Museum’s Dr Alex Bond and Dr Jennifer Lavers, studied flesh-footed shearwaters from Australia’s Lord Howe Island to look at the relationship between levels of ingested plastic and the proventriculus organ – the first part of a bird’s stomach.

They found that the more plastic a bird had ingested, the more scarring it had. The disease can lead to the gradual breakdown of tubular glands in the proventriculus. Losing these glands can cause the birds to become more vulnerable to infection and parasites and affect their ability to digest food and absorb some vitamins.

Researchers called the fibrotic disease plasticosis to make it clear that it was caused by plastic in the environment.

When birds ingest small pieces of plastic, they found, it inflames the digestive tract. Over time, the persistent inflammation causes tissues to become scarred and disfigured, affecting digestion, growth and survival.

Natural materials found in the stomachs of birds, such as pumice stones, did not cause the same problems, leading scientists to label this a specifically plastic-caused disease.

Bond, principal curator in charge of birds at the Natural History Museum, said: “While these birds can look healthy on the outside, they’re not doing well on the inside. This study is the first time that stomach tissue has been investigated in this way and shows that plastic consumption can cause serious damage to these birds’ digestive system.”

Though the scientists studied only one species of bird in one part of the world, they believe it is likely that more species are affected, and say more research is needed to find out how widespread plasticosis is.

They say the exposure of all organisms to plastic is inevitable, because plastic emissions are increasing and plastic pollution is becoming prevalent in all environments globally.

As this problem has only emerged in recent decades, it has not been widely studied. The researchers said: “Further, the ingestion of plastic has far-reaching and severe consequences, many of which we are only just beginning to fully document and understand.”

319,319,https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2022-03-10/how-the-covid-pandemic-has-impacted-chronic-disease,How the COVID Pandemic Has Impacted Chronic Disease,"With more than 950,000 deaths and close to 80 million cases in the U.S. alone, few would argue the COVID-19 pandemic hasn’t had a devastating impact on Americans’ health. Yet we may only be just starting to understand the true effects of the crisis.

In particular, the pandemic – now at its two-year mark – has played a pivotal role in changing the health landscape by hindering chronic disease management for many patients, raising the specter of more severe illness for many with underlying health conditions. Such factors are likely contributors to increases in mortality for some of the leading causes of death in the U.S. , such as Alzheimer’s disease and diabetes.

“Many of the conditions and issues that need to be addressed with diabetes have been delayed for a really long time,” says Dr. Robert Gabbay, chief scientific and medical officer for the American Diabetes Association. “That’s a significant factor that unfortunately we’ll continue to see the implications of over time.”



Diabetes

The pandemic has placed a dangerous strain on the health care system and undoubtedly disrupted patient care: An April 2021 survey conducted by the Urban Institute found that a quarter of nonelderly adults reported delaying or forgoing care in the past 12 months over fear of exposure to COVID-19. The survey also found adults with chronic health conditions were more likely to report forgoing or delaying care in the past 30 days compared to people without a chronic disease.

Gabbay says the postponement of preventive and routine care visits has led to a rise in people with undiagnosed diabetes and an increase in uncontrolled blood sugar levels among those already diagnosed. Socioeconomic fallout – data depicts struggles with homelessness and debt among diabetic patients during the pandemic – also has affected the ability of patients with diabetes to effectively manage their condition, he says. That process can come with high out-of-pocket costs.

“The pandemic has been a magnifier for some common problems – one of those has been affordability of medical care and treatment for those with diabetes,” Gabbay says.

Rates of newly diagnosed diabetes cases among adults had been in decline in the U.S. over the last decade. Yet an increase among children and adolescents in diabetes incidence, as well as in the prevalence of prediabetes among youth, raised concerns even before the pandemic.

Now, data points to the direct and indirect impacts of the pandemic on people with diabetes: A study published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2020 showed that approximately 40% of more than 10,000 people who died of COVID-19 had diabetes, one of many conditions that can increase a person’s risk of severe illness tied to the disease. Meanwhile, the annual number of diabetes deaths in the U.S. topped 100,000 in 2020 for the first time ever – rising by more than 16% over the total in 2019 – and an analysis of provisional data by Reuters indicated similar figures for 2021.

And though much focus has been on how COVID-19 impacts people who already have diabetes, Gabbay says there is evidence suggesting the coronavirus itself may fuel new diabetes cases as well.

Some new diagnoses, he says, likely stem from individuals who contracted COVID-19 and then discovered their diabetes status after seeking treatment. But a study published last May in the journal Cell Metabolism found COVID-19 can infect beta cells in the pancreas, hindering the body’s ability to produce insulin. The hormone regulates blood sugar in the body, and having too little of it is a problem connected to diabetes. A recent CDC study also found a higher risk of newly diagnosed diabetes among children under age 18 who had contracted COVID-19.

Gabbay says such findings are concerning for individuals who were already at risk of developing diabetes prior to coming down with COVID-19.

“This has long-term public health implications,” he says.

At the same time, a study published in February in the Journal of Diabetes and its Complications suggests the impact COVID-19 may have on diabetes onset may be short-lived. Researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston examined nearly 600 COVID-19 patients who were identified as having diabetes and found approximately 41% of survivors whose diabetes had not been previously diagnosed later regressed to either a normal blood sugar level or prediabetes.

Lead study author Dr. Sara Cromer, an investigator in the Department of Medicine-Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism at Mass General, says the findings suggest new diabetes diagnoses in some patients may be due to inflammatory stress in response to COVID-19 that causes temporary insulin resistance, rather than a permanent inability of the body to produce insulin.

Cromer says such responses have been seen in other infections, but that it appears to be more common in COVID-19 patients. She says the use of high doses of steroids in treating COVID-19 also can cause insulin resistance and blood sugar levels to rise.

“The combination of the severe inflammatory response to COVID and the use of high-dose steroids may kind of cause a perfect storm that leads to those very high blood sugars, but that can improve once someone has resolution of their COVID and is no longer on those steroids,” Cromer says.

Lung Problems

It’s well-documented that the coronavirus can cause various lung complications such as pneumonia, blood clots and acute respiratory distress syndrome. For the roughly 37 million Americans who live with a chronic lung disease like asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the pandemic has added new levels of anxiety for both patients and clinicians.

“They’re living in fear,” says Dr. Panagis Galiatsatos, a national spokesman for the American Lung Association and director of the Johns Hopkins Tobacco Treatment Clinic. “They know they are a bad cold away from being admitted to the intensive care unit.”

After adjusting for risk factors like hypertension and obesity, a study published last year in the International Journal of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease found that the mortality rate among people with COVID-19 was more than two times higher among those who also had COPD. At the same time, the number of people who died due to a chronic lower respiratory disease such as COPD declined by about 3% in 2020, while the corresponding death rate dropped by nearly 5%.

Unlike with diabetes patients, Galiatsatos says the pandemic has not really hindered chronic lung disease patients from actively managing their conditions. He says pandemic safety measures like masking have brought the rest of the country around to adhering to the kinds of precautions people living with such conditions have had to practice for years.

“What I’m hoping is that we begin to take airborne viruses really seriously and learn to have a specific culture that allows us to live among these public health crisis-causing viruses without that much disruption,” Galiatsatos says. “I’m hoping we learn our lesson of how to adapt to this.”

A big part of that effort will rely on scientists’ ability to properly convey to the public the severity of future disease threats – an issue that has come to the fore during the pandemic as misinformation or shifts in messaging about COVID-19, mask-wearing and vaccines have strained trust between the public and health experts.

Should similar scenarios arise in the future, Galiatsatos says better messaging will be needed for the public to understand and be more willing to adhere to measures like mask-wearing and social distancing earlier in the progression of airborne disease threats.

“Otherwise the community won’t have our trust and the community won’t have the recognition of how severe these things are,” Galiatsatos says. “Science needs to have these conversations continually, consistently, and not just at times of crises.”



Cancer

The recent spike in COVID-19 hospitalizations tied to the omicron variant led to bed shortages and made it increasingly difficult for hospitals to address the needs of non-COVID patients with serious conditions like cancer, says Dr. Arif Kamal, chief patient officer for the American Cancer Society.

Kamal also says decreases in patients receiving diagnostic services like cancer screenings have occurred during each major wave of the pandemic, and some health systems have been forced to redeploy supportive care personnel from their cancer centers to other areas to address hospital staff shortages.

“We’re starting to see folks who play sort of a preventative role – for example, checking in with cancer patients regularly to see how they are doing – there may be in fact less of those calls taking place and less access to those support care resources,” Kamal says.

The nursing shortages many health care providers across the country have faced during the pandemic have also been a concern at many cancer centers, Kamal says, while staffing shortages reported in cancer service areas like infusion therapy have led to treatment delays as well. We’ve seen “some shutdowns of in-person clinics and buildings, so that naturally affects a lot of the screening work that’s been happening,” Kamal says.

Such factors have led to a steep decline in the detection of new cancer cases, at least some of which may be found later at a more advanced stage. Dr. Norman Sharpless, director of the National Cancer Institute, last year said new diagnoses dropped by around 50% in months after the pandemic took hold in 2020. And a study published in June that examined the pandemic’s impact on cancer services in Louisiana and Georgia found there were nearly 30,000 fewer cancer pathology reports than in 2019, representing a 10.2% decline.

Internationally, an analysis of data from 2020 that was published in The Lancet Oncology found that 1 in 7 patients in regions where a full lockdown occurred had not received a planned cancer surgery.

In the U.S., early detection has helped spur significant drops in cancer mortality over the past three decades, with the death rate declining by 32% between 1991 and 2019, according to a report by American Cancer Society researchers. CDC data also shows about a 1.5% decline in the cancer mortality rate between 2019 and 2020.

But Kamal fears pandemic-related delays in preventive and treatment services, compounded by reports of supply chain disruptions that are delaying access to supportive medications like antibiotics and anti-nausea drugs, could lead to a reversal of this decadeslong progress.

“Much of the progress over the last 30 years of cancer care delivery has been not just new drugs to treat cancer but also new drugs to support patients going through that treatment process,” Kamal says.

The development of new cancer treatments also has been affected by the pandemic, as concerns over the spread of COVID-19 have created challenges in getting participants for clinical trials, causing some to be delayed or halted altogether, Kamal says.

“Naturally the concern there is that the development of new drugs and the testing of existing drugs will slow, and has slowed down during the pandemic,” Kamal says.



Alzheimer’s Disease

In many ways, the pandemic was a perfect storm that proved deadly for patients living with Alzheimer’s disease.

“COVID-19 was really devastating and continues to be devastating for people living with dementia,” says Beth Kallmyer, vice president of care and support for the Alzheimer’s Association.

Kallmyer points out that people living with dementia often live in communal environments like long-term care facilities and nursing homes – places that have been hit hard by COVID-19. As of Jan. 30, more than 200,000 COVID-related deaths had occurred in long-term care facilities among residents and staff, accounting for at least 23% of all COVID deaths in the U.S., according to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation.

And while people suffering from dementia can face an increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19 itself, the pandemic’s disruption to health care has proved to be a serious threat to patients often incapable of managing their condition without caregiver support.

“Now all of sudden you’re in a nursing home and you have a patient that might need inpatient care, or you’re taking care of an elderly loved one at home who may be in need of inpatient care – the bar to actually go to the emergency room gets a lot higher when you’re worried they could be exposed to something in that setting,” says Dr. Lauren Gilstrap, an assistant professor of medicine at Dartmouth College’s Geisel School of Medicine .

Gilstrap is the lead author of a study published last month in JAMA Neurology that found the mortality rate among Medicare beneficiaries ages 65 and older with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias was 26% higher in 2020 than it was during a corresponding period in 2019. Among beneficiaries without dementia, the mortality rate was 12% higher.

Gilstrap says mortality patterns in areas where COVID-19 cases were low appear to implicate changes to health care services in higher mortality among dementia patients more than the actual disease of COVID-19. Those changes include decreased access to inpatient hospital services and outpatient clinics in favor of virtual tools like telehealth, coupled with visiting restrictions in nursing homes that likely increased feelings of social isolation and loneliness for many patients, Gilstrap says. Social isolation among older adults has been associated with an increased risk of developing dementia, as well as premature death.

“While COVID may be driving some small proportion of the increase in mortality, it’s probably not driving the bulk of it,” Gilstrap says

Overall, the U.S. death rate from Alzheimer’s rose by 8.7% in 2020 to 32.4 for every 100,000 people, compared with 29.8 per 100,000 people in 2019, according to data from the CDC . The number of Alzheimer’s deaths increased by nearly 13,000 , representing a more than 10% surge.

A Positive

Though it’s difficult to gauge precisely how delays in disease management and other factors will affect the nation’s health in the long term, experts agree a positive that’s come out of the pandemic has been health care’s ability to rapidly transition to provide care to patients remotely.

Still, Dr. Donald Lloyd-Jones, president of the American Heart Association, acknowledges the ripple effects caused by the last two years are likely to last well after the pandemic ends.

Clinicians, he says, likely will have to treat more patients who have experienced setbacks on risk factors such as blood pressure control. Study findings presented at an annual AHA meeting, for example, revealed the average share of adults with hypertension and optimal blood pressure control had declined from 60.5% in 2019 to 53.3% in 2020.","Cromer says such responses have been seen in other infections, but that it appears to be more common in COVID-19 patients.
For the roughly 37 million Americans who live with a chronic lung disease like asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the pandemic has added new levels of anxiety for both patients and clinicians.
Unlike with diabetes patients, Galiatsatos says the pandemic has not really hindered chronic lung disease patients from actively managing their conditions.
CDC data also shows about a 1.5% decline in the cancer mortality rate between 2019 and 2020.

320,320,https://ottawa.ctvnews.ca/protesters-quickly-adapting-to-police-measures-ottawa-chief-1.5770548,Protesters quickly adapting to police measures: Ottawa chief,"Ottawa Police Chief Peter Sloly says protesters are countering any police actions to bring an end to the “Freedom Convoy” demonstration that has occupied the downtown core of the nation’s capital for 11 days, with no signs of ending.

Speaking on CTV News at Six Monday evening, Sloly said demonstrators are adapting quickly to any enforcement efforts, such as disallowing fuel containers into the downtown core.

""What was happening during the course of the day is some of the protesters were deliberately filling jerry cans with water, literally drinking out of them to show the police that they weren't gasoline,"" Sloly said. ""Meanwhile, they were carrying gasoline in other containers that would have been carrying water.""

Police made the announcement Sunday that fuel would not be allowed into the protest “red zone” and that anyone bringing supplies to the protest could face arrest. It came hours before police seized thousands of litres of fuel from a staging area on Coventry Road.

Sloly said the countermeasures speak to the ""sophistication and commitment"" of the operation, as demonstrators appear able to pivot en masse in reaction to police efforts.

The police chief also said officers were swarmed at one point during an attempted arrest.

""Our officers were surrounded by over 100 demonstrators,"" he said. ""A near-riot broke out within minutes of being on the air here, to do what we've been saying we doing: enforcing and reducing the fuel supply, interdicting the gasoline going in there—at great risk in every single encounter.""

Speaking to reporters later in the evening, Deputy Police Chief Steve Bell said an investigation into the incident is underway, an arrest was made and charges are pending.

Sloly pushed back against comparisons to other cities that have had similar protests, such as Toronto and Quebec City.

""Deputy minister Mario Di Tommaso, on a call today with the three levels of government said, 'Hey, Peter, what do you think about using heavy tow trucks to remove the trucks that are in your town? Toronto did it. They did it on the weekend. They had one tow truck go out and confront six trucks and the six trucks left.' I said, 'Well, I have two heavy two trucks here from the city and I had a thousand trucks on Saturday and last Saturday, I had 3,000 trucks,'"" Sloly said. ""That's like comparing Pluto the Sun, in terms of the scale and the complexity and the violence that this city has experienced, compared to other jurisdictions. This is a completely different beast that we're dealing with here in Ottawa.""

Police estimate between 400 and 500 trucks remain in the downtown core. Sloly has asked other levels of government for 1,800 additional police officers and civilian staff. For comparison, the full size of the Ottawa Police Service is 2,100 members.

CITY SEEKING STRONGER FINES

The City of Ottawa has asked the Chief Justice of Ontario to increase the value of fines being issued to protesters with the ""Freedom Convoy"" demonstration that has occupied the downtown core for 11 days and counting.

In opening remarks to a special meeting of city council, Mayor Jim Watson said the penalties for some of the demonstration's tactics would be increased.

Watson said the fine for idling would increase to $1,000 from $100, the fine for violating the noise bylaw would increase to $1,000 from $490 and the fine for encumbering a roadway would be increased to $1,000 from $350.

""Chief bylaw officer Roger Chapman has confirmed that the Chief Justice of Ontario is supportive of our request and is committed to enacting these higher fines as soon as possible,"" Watson said.

POLICE CHIEF REQUESTING SURGE OF 1,800 PERSONNEL

Ottawa police chief Peter Sloly told city council he was seeking a major surge in resources, requesting 1,800 police officers and civilian staff to help manage the ongoing demonstration and occupation downtown.

""To put that into some perspective, the entire amount of members of the Ottawa Police Service is 2,100. The entire amount of police officers in the Ottawa Police Service is 1,200. We are asking for 1,800 of police and civilian resources for our immediate use within our incident command umbrella,"" he said.

Sloly said so far, the RCMP has sent 257 officers and the OPP has sent an average of 100 additional officers per day over the last week.

""We are asking for more. It is not enough. It is not sustainable,"" Sloly said, as he thanked RCMP Commissioner Brenda Lucki and OPP Commissioner Thomas Carrique for their support. Sloly also expressed his gratefulness for support from municipal forces from eastern Ontario, the GTHA and the Niagara Region.

""This unacceptable and unlawful demonstration must end,"" Sloly said.

On Saturday, Ottawa's police chief admitted the force doesn't have enough resources to address the situation.

“We do not have sufficient resources to adequately and effectively address this situation while adequately and effectively providing policing in this city,"" said Chief Peter Sloly during a special Ottawa Police Services Board meeting.

According to a letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Public Safety Minister Marco Mendicino, the city is seeking 1,000 regular officers, 600 public order officers, 100 investigative officers, 100 civilian staff and ""all supporting resources."" The same request was made in a letter to Ontario Premier Doug Ford and Solicitor General Sylvia Jones.

""We ask the Government of Canada and the Province of Ontario to work with us to secure this combined officer surge from the Government of Canada, the Province of Ontario and municipal police forces willing to participate from Ontario and other provinces,"" the letters say.

WATSON ASK FOR MEDIATION BETWEEN FEDS, PROTESTERS

Watson earlier called on the Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government to appoint a mediator in an effort to end the 'Freedom Convoy' occupation in the city's downtown.

He said he has suggested to federal ministers that a mediator could be ""an honest broker on both sides to try to find some common ground, if that's possible.""

""Someone of great stature in our community and the country who can actually open doors and bring some peace and calm to the situation,"" Watson told CTV Morning Live. ""That’s one option that I think the federal government should pursue, because right now we’re at a complete standoff.""

Watson's suggestion comes ahead of a special council meeting Monday afternoon, with the ongoing demonstration entering an 11th day. You can watch the meeting here starting at 1 p.m.

The meeting comes as officials hope increased enforcement by police will lead to a turning point in efforts to end the occupation.

Police moved to cut off the supply of gasoline, propane and other ""material supports"" to the demonstrators on Sunday, seizing more than 3,000 litres of fuel at the Ottawa Baseball Stadium and threatening to arrest anyone bringing supplies into the downtown area.

Seven people were arrested during enforcement initiatives targeting the demonstration on Sunday, while more than 100 tickets were issued for Highway Traffic Act offences.

On Sunday, Watson declared a state of emergency due to the ongoing demonstration, giving the city the ""administrative tool"" to cut red tape in the procurement policy.

Mayor Jim Watson declared a state of emergency in his city on Sunday, Feb. 6, 2022 in the face of ongoing protests that have overwhelmed local resources shortly before police moved to choke the convoy's supply chain.

Watson told CTV News Ottawa police are now taking a ""more aggressive stand.""

""They have to be much more aggressive in terms of these fines. Someone is going to get killed or seriously injured because of the irresponsible behaviour of some of these people who are honking their horns and destroying the fabric of neighbourhoods,"" Watson said.

“At the end of the day, it’s going to be a combination of enforcement, to a certain degree, as well as compromise and cutting off the supply lines of these people,"" he said. ""We can’t allow them to have barbecues and turn this into a real carnival. It’s an absolute disgrace.""

The Rideau Centre, Ottawa City Hall and the Rink of Dreams, two public library branches and two COVID-19 vaccination clinics remain closed due to the ongoing road closures and traffic gridlock in the downtown core.

Cadillac Fairview, which owns the Rideau Centre, said in a statement that authorities ""cannot provide any assurances that it is safe"" to open the mall.

At the council meeting, Coun. Catherine McKenney expects councillors to move several motions during the special council meeting. McKenney will table a motion asking the federal government to take over policing of the Parliamentary Precinct.

""I need to see the federal government assume operation control for the Parliamentary Precinct,"" said McKenney during an interview on Newstalk 580 CFRA. ""We can request that; they can't just move in but we can make that formal request and that would then free up all of our local police to turn their attention into the residential areas that are under occupation in the city.""

INJUNCTION GRANTED AGAINST USE OF HORNS

A 10-day injunction against the constant honking as part of the protest has been granted by a judge.

A $9.8 million class-action proposed lawsuit was filed by local lawyer Paul Champ on behalf of residents in Ottawa affected by the ongoing demonstration.

Superior Court Justice Hugh McLean heard the arguments Monday afternoon and granted an injunction for 10 days.

Lead plaintiff in the class action suit, Zexi Li, told CTV News Channel on Monday that living in the downtown core has been ""unbearable"" these past 11 days.

“There are people who have had to evacuate their homes because they can't stand the noise because it is literally, quite literally, torturous to us,” Li said. “And we are not going to stay quiet anymore because people need to understand the real damage this is doing to real people.”","Speaking on CTV News at Six Monday evening, Sloly said demonstrators are adapting quickly to any enforcement efforts, such as disallowing fuel containers into the downtown core.

Since the first Disease Outbreak News on this event was published on 25 February 2023, eight additional laboratory-confirmed cases of Marburg virus disease (MVD) have been reported in Equatorial Guinea. This brings the total to nine laboratory-confirmed cases and 20 probable cases since the declaration of the outbreak in February 2023. There are seven deaths among the laboratory confirmed, and all probable cases are dead. Of the eight new confirmed cases, two were reported from the province of Kié-Ntem, four from the Litoral, and two from Centre- Sur provinces. The areas reporting cases are about 150 kilometers apart, suggesting wider transmission of the virus.

WHO has deployed experts to support national response efforts and strengthen community engagement in the response.

MVD is a highly virulent disease that causes haemorrhagic fever, and is among the viral haemorrhagic fevers that require assessment under the International Health Regulations.

WHO assesses the risk posed by the outbreak as very high at the national level, moderate at the regional level, and low at the global level.

Description of the situation

On 7 February 2023, the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare of Equatorial Guinea reported at least eight suspected MVD deaths that occurred between 7 January and 7 February 2023, in two villages located in the district of Nsok Nsomo, in the eastern province of Kié-Ntem, Río Muni Region.

On 12 February 2023, eight blood samples were collected from contacts and sent to the Institute Pasteur in Dakar, Senegal, where one of these samples was confirmed positive for Marburg virus by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). This case presented with fever, vomiting, blood-stained diarrhoea, convulsions, and died on 10 February 2023 in a hospital. The case also had epidemiological links to four deceased suspected cases from one of the villages in Nsok-Nsomo district.

On 13 March 2023, samples from two additional individuals from Kié-Ntem province tested positive for MVD by RT-PCR performed at a mobile laboratory at the Regional Hospital of Ebibeyin. Another sample, obtained from a resident of Litoral province in the western part of the country, epidemiologically linked to a confirmed case in Kié-Ntem, tested positive for MVD on 15 March 2023 following RT-PCR performed by the same laboratory. The two provinces (Kié-Ntem and Litoral) are located in different parts of the country, about 150 kilometers apart. On 18 and 20 March three additional laboratory confirmed positive cases were reported from Litoral province. On 20 March two more laboratory confirmed cases were reported from Centre Sur province. The wide geographic distribution of cases and uncertain epidemiological links in Centre Sur province suggests the potential for undetected community spread of the virus.

Overall, since the beginning of the outbreak and as of 21 March, a cumulative number of nine confirmed and 20 probable cases have been recorded in Equatorial Guinea.

Epidemiology of Marburg virus disease

Marburg virus and the closely related Ravn virus are the causative agents of Marburg virus disease, which has a case-fatality ratio of up to 88%. Marburg virus disease was initially detected in 1967 after simultaneous outbreaks in Marburg and Frankfurt in Germany, and in Belgrade, Serbia. Rousettus aegyptiacus fruit bats are considered natural hosts for Marburg virus, from which the virus is then transmitted to people.

Marburg spreads between people via direct contact through broken skin or mucous membranes with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people, and with surfaces and materials such as bedding, clothing contaminated with these fluids. Healthcare workers have previously been infected while treating patients with suspected or confirmed MVD. Burial ceremonies that involve direct contact with the body of the deceased can also contribute to the transmission of Marburg.

The incubation period varies from two to 21 days. Illness caused by Marburg virus begins abruptly, with high fever, severe headache, and severe malaise. Severe watery diarrhoea, abdominal pain and cramping, nausea, and vomiting can begin on the third day. Severe haemorrhagic manifestations may appear between five and seven days from symptom onset, and fatal cases usually have some form of bleeding, often from multiple areas. In fatal cases, death occurs most often between eight and nine days after symptom onset, usually preceded by severe blood loss and shock.

In the early course of the disease, the clinical diagnosis of MVD is difficult to distinguish from many other tropical febrile illnesses due to the similarities in the clinical symptoms. Other viral haemorrhagic fevers need to be excluded, including Ebola virus disease, as well as malaria, typhoid fever, leptospirosis, rickettsial infections, and plague.

Laboratory confirmation is primarily made by RT-PCR. Other tests can be used such as antibody-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), antigen-capture detection tests, serum neutralization test, electron microscopy, and virus isolation by cell culture.

Although no vaccines or antiviral treatments are approved to treat the virus, supportive care – rehydration with oral or intravenous fluids – and treatment of specific symptoms improve survival. A range of potential treatments are being evaluated, including blood products, immune therapies, and drug therapies.

This is the first time that Equatorial Guinea has reported an outbreak of MVD. The most recently reported outbreak of MVD was in Ghana in 2022 (where there were three confirmed cases). Other MVD outbreaks have been previously reported in Guinea (2021), Uganda (2017, 2014, 2012, 2007), Angola (2004-2005), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (1998 and 2000), Kenya (1990, 1987, 1980) and South Africa (1975).","Situation at a glanceSince the first Disease Outbreak News on this event was published on 25 February 2023, eight additional laboratory-confirmed cases of Marburg virus disease (MVD) have been reported in Equatorial Guinea.

It can develop anywhere in the digestive tract, but is most often found at the end of the small intestine or the beginning of the large intestine (colon). Though it can be diagnosed at any age, Crohn's is typically diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 30.

This article discusses the age of onset for Crohn's disease, who is most likely to get it, and signs to watch for.

Crohn's Disease Timeline

Crohn's disease most commonly occurs during two different stages of life: either between the ages of 20 and 30 or later in life, after the age of 60. However, it is not dictated by age and can develop at any time.

Age of Development

About 25% of people with Crohn's disease will develop it as children or young adults before the age of 20. Most cases, however, occur between the ages of 20 and 30.

Up to 15% of those who develop Crohn's or another form of IBD, including ulcerative colitis, are over age 60.



Age of Diagnosis

Because some of the symptoms of Crohn's—like diarrhea and abdominal pain—can be caused by a wide range of conditions, it's not uncommon for people to have symptoms for as long as five years before they are diagnosed. Diagnosis commonly occurs in people between the ages of 20 and 30.

Sometimes, Crohn's does not cause symptoms at all, which is referred to as ""silent Crohn's."" Diagnosing silent Crohn's can only be accomplished through surgical procedures like endoscopy, in which lesions are visible.

Crohn's Diagnosis in Children Though pediatric Crohn's disease was once considered rare, the number of cases in children under the age of 6 has increased. An estimated 40,000 children in the United States have Crohn's.

Signs and Symptoms

Crohn’s disease can affect any part of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, from the mouth to the anus.

While symptoms vary by patient, these are some common symptoms of Crohn’s disease:

Recurring diarrhea and gas

Blood in the stool

Abdominal pain and cramping

Constipation (having trouble passing stool or having infrequent bowel movements—usually fewer than three a week)

Urgent need to have a bowel movement or feeling it is incomplete

Abscesses (infected pockets under the skin) near the anus

People with Crohn's may also have a fever, fatigue, or lose their appetite and become malnourished.

If the disease is untreated or severe, people can develop abscesses, tears and sores in internal tissue, and fistulas, which are abnormal openings in the GI tract. These can be treated with medication or, sometimes, surgery.

How Is Crohn's Diagnosed?

There is no single test to diagnose Crohn's disease. A healthcare provider will first rule out other reasons why you may be having the symptoms. This may include asking about family history, since Crohn's tends to run in families and is more common in certain populations.

A provider will also ask about your individual medical history, including any symptoms you are experiencing and when they developed. They will also perform a physical exam.

Some other tests or scans may be needed to diagnose Crohn's, including:

Lab tests , including blood and fecal (stool) samples

, including blood and fecal (stool) samples Imaging studies like ultrasound, X-rays, enterography (which looks at the small intestine), or a CT (computed tomography) scan, which provides a view of the digestive tract for signs of swelling or sores

Summary

People with Crohn's disease, a form of inflammatory bowel disease, are usually diagnosed between the ages of about 20 and 30. However, people of any age—including young children and people over age 60—can develop it. Crohn's causes symptoms like abdominal pain, diarrhea, and sores on the anus. It can be diagnosed through various tests.

A Word From Verywell

If you repeatedly have digestive problems or any symptoms of Crohn's disease, discuss these with your healthcare provider. Early treatment of Crohn's and other digestive conditions is essential to your health and in reducing potential damage to your digestive tract. Fortunately, there are many effective treatments for Crohn's disease that can help you to live and function well.","Crohn's disease is an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that causes swelling in the lining of the digestive tract.

The training included the development of genetic disease resistance in bananas.

One of the most devastating banana diseases in the world, the Banana Fusarium Wilt, is spreading rapidly in the region. It hurts global supplies of the world’s most popular export banana variety — the Cavendish.

In response to an urgent request from affected countries, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi last year pledged that the IAEA would provide immediate assistance in combating the disease and preventing it from causing further damage, working together with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).

“Immediately after receiving the request for assistance, we dispatched a technical mission to assess the situation and provide emergency assistance. Training scientists from the region is a vital part of this assistance as it builds skills and other capacity in managing and controlling a disease that is hurting livelihoods across the region,” said Director General Grossi, who met the researchers during their training in the IAEA laboratories in Seibersdorf, Austria. He will also be meeting foreign and trade ministers from the Andean Community in Ecuador’s capital Quito later this month.

As part of the assistance, twelve scientists from Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela received training in February in Seibersdorf. The topics covered mutation breeding, tissue culture, development of mutant populations, and in screening protocols for disease resistance.

“Thanks to the training, I understand the high potential of irradiation approaches to increase banana’s resistance to Fusarium. I was glad to learn how the IAEA can contribute to the resolution of this important problem in our countries,” said Mauricio Soto-Suárez, a PhD researcher in plant pathology from Colombia. He is one of the banana breeders, pathologists, and tissue culture specialists, who participated in the two week training course, which took place at the Plant Breeding and Genetics Laboratory of the Joint FAO/IAEA Centre of Nuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture in Seibersdorf and at IAEA Headquarters in Vienna.

The IAEA will support the affected countries over the next five years in disease detection, surveillance, and containment. They will also receive scientific advice on how to boost the genetic resistance of banana plants using mutation breeding and associated biotechnologies.

In August last year, experts and authorities from the Andean community — Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru — reached out to the IAEA when they discovered the continuing spread of the latest variant of the Fusarium wilt disease, Tropical Race 4 (TR4), in the region. It has now spread to more than 20 countries around the world.

The course follows an IAEA expert mission to the region in October last year during which the existing situation for TR4 was discussed, a draft five-year plan was agreed, and urgent procurement needs were addressed.

The banana is one of the world’s top staple foods, with over 400 million people relying on this fruit for food security and income. The annual production of bananas across the globe amounts to some 155 million metric tons, with about 25 million tons exported from tropical countries in Latin America, the Caribbean and other parts of the world.

TR4 is a soil-borne disease, which can survive for decades in the soil, making it difficult to control. The only long-term response is to develop and deploy new banana varieties with effective disease resistance. This can be done thanks to mutation breeding – a process using irradiation techniques that help develop new disease resistant crop varieties for farmers. Confined to Southeast Asia for decades, TR4 was for the first time discovered in Latin America in 2019, causing a national emergency in Colombia, the fifth largest exporter of bananas in the world.

The IAEA, in partnership with the FAO, has a long and established track record in applying nuclear and related techniques to improve crop plants, and develop resistance to diseases. Banana research in the IAEA/FAO laboratories and relevant capacity building in Member States goes back at least two decades. It addresses key techniques that include cell and tissue culture, mutation induction, screening for disease and pest resistance, and related molecular and cytogenetics techniques.","The training included the development of genetic disease resistance in bananas.

RF generated the most accurate ML model to predict fatty liver presence, steatosis (stages) and fibrosis. To our knowledge, this is the first study applying ML on body composition and anthropometric data to predict NAFLD. High accuracy (82%) highlights the potential for applying ML techniques for the primary prevention and screening of NAFLD using anthropometric measurements.

Previous studies using ML techniques to predict fatty liver disease have mainly focused on biochemical measurements, with similar levels of accuracy (83.0%) using Bayesian Network38, (76.3%) Logistic Regression37, (86.4%) RF39 and (80%) Classification Tree techniques36. However, we tested the predictive value of body composition and anthropometric measurements rather than biochemical variables. Anthropometry as a lower-cost and more feasible approach can be considered a primary screening method for fatty liver disease.

Abdominal obesity is a significant risk factor leading to NAFLD27. Waist circumference and trunk fat have been shown to be significantly predicting the risk of NAFLD24. Although BMI is one of the risk factors of NAFLD31, it has been argued that BMI is limited compared to other anthropometric measures (e.g., waist circumference) in identifying lean NAFLD individuals25. In a similar vein, the findings of the present study clearly show the importance of these body composition and anthropometric measures and their relative contribution to the prediction of NAFLD.

Neck circumference reflects the amount of subcutaneous fat in the upper body, and is a reliable factor in determining central obesity48. A positive correlation has been shown between neck circumference and hepatic steatosis26,28. Neck circumference showed a positive association with other anthropometric components, such as BMI and waist and waist-to-hip circumference. In the present study, neck circumference contributed almost equally to hepatic steatosis and fibrosis.

A study by Subramanian revealed that the level of arm fat index in both males and females had a negative association with the degree and severity of NAFLD29. In our study, a strong and positive relationship between arm circumference and the severity of steatosis and fibrosis was detected, validated by the ML model. Rafiee et al. showed that the amount of fat in hips and legs and circumference of hip negatively associated with fatty liver and the severity of the disease. In contrast, the waist-to-hip ratio was closely associated with fatty liver. They also showed that the accuracy of this ratio in predicting NAFLD was greater than BMI and waist-to-height ratio49.

Most ML studies for the prediction of NAFLD have used the ultrasonography technique to diagnose fatty liver disease36,37,38,39. Ultrasound is a commonly used method for the diagnosis of hepatic steatosis50. Ultrasonography is a safe, well-tolerated, non-invasive and low-cost technique50; however, there are limitations associated with ultrasound use, including limited capability in detecting fatty infiltration (less than 20% steatosis), operator dependency and subjective assessment51,52, and ML is expected to minimise some of these. Application of ML techniques on body composition and anthropometric measures as a less time-consuming and easy to undertake method can help physicians in their clinical decision making.

The presence of liver fibrosis in patients with NAFLD is considered the strongest predictor of long-term outcome53. NAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS) and Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) have been recommended as appropriate methods for the initial assessment of fibrosis in NAFLD patients54. Both of these methods use a combination of variables including age, BMI and biochemical measures (i.e. aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), platelets, etc.). Graupera et al. concluded that NFS and FIB-4 are not optimal for screening as they correlate poorly with liver stiffness55. In their study, waist circumference was found to be the ideal measure for fibrosis screening among high risk people from general population55. However, other studies found that NFS and FIB-4 have the potential to detect advanced fibrosis and the progression of fibrosis among people with NAFLD56. It seems that NFS and FIB-4 are more useful in the diagnosis of fibrosis in NAFLD but not for fibrosis screening among the general populations. The present study showed suboptimal accuracy (57%) in detecting fibrosis using less expensive and non-invasive factors i.e. anthropometric and body composition measures. Further studies might explore a combination of these methods including anthropometric, body composition and biochemical variables altogether.

The proposed algorithm identified in this research can be used by the health systems for several reasons. Screening of the presence or absence of NAFLD with the help of non-invasive anthropometric measurements can be achieved with simple and cheap equipment57. Moreover, performing the measurement task needs less specialty knowledge therefore can be implemented in several health centres (e.g., primary practice) and also remote areas. Once validated, the resulted assistive technology can serve the clinicians in the prevention of liver diseases. There are limitations of the present research that need to be addressed. A small sample size might have potentially limited the results of ML prediction. Although, the small sample size was accounted for by multiple cross-validations, which reduced potential errors. Future studies with larger sample sizes can allocate separate validation sets and evaluate the model. Moreover, even though the most common method for fatty liver diagnosis, the ultrasound technique is not the gold standard. Using liver biopsy outcomes would generate more valid results. Also, to increase the predictive accuracy of the proposed model for NAFLD prediction, future studies should include other body composition and anthropometric measures such as sagittal abdominal diameter (SAD) and peri-renal fat58.","However, we tested the predictive value of body composition and anthropometric measurements rather than biochemical variables.
Anthropometry as a lower-cost and more feasible approach can be considered a primary screening method for fatty liver disease.

327,327,https://scitechdaily.com/improved-physical-fitness-linked-to-lower-risk-of-alzheimers-disease/,Improved Physical Fitness Linked to Lower Risk of Alzheimer’s Disease,"People who are more physically fit are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease than people who are less physically fit, according to a preliminary study released today, February 27, 2022, that will be presented at the American Academy of Neurology’s 74th Annual Meeting being held in person in Seattle, April 2 to 7, 2022 and virtually, April 24 to 26, 2022.

“One exciting finding of this study is that as people’s fitness improved, their risk of Alzheimer’s disease decreased—it was not an all-or-nothing proposition,” said study author Edward Zamrini, MD, of the Washington VA Medical Center in Washington, D.C., and a member of the American Academy of Neurology. “So people can work toward making incremental changes and improvements in their physical fitness and hopefully that will be associated with a related decrease in their risk of Alzheimer’s years later.”

The study involved 649,605 military veterans in the Veterans Health Administration database with an average age of 61 who were followed for an average of nine years. They did not have Alzheimer’s disease at the start of the study.

Researchers determined participants’ cardiorespiratory fitness. Cardiorespiratory fitness is a measure of how well your body transports oxygen to your muscles, and how well your muscles are able to absorb oxygen during exercise.

The participants were divided into five groups, from least fit to most fit. Fitness levels were determined by how well participants did on a treadmill test. This test measures exercise capacity, the highest amount of physical exertion a person can sustain. For people who are middle-aged and older, the highest level of fitness can be achieved by walking briskly most days of the week, for two and a half hours or more per week.

The group with the lowest level of fitness developed Alzheimer’s at a rate of 9.5 cases per 1,000 person-years, compared to 6.4 cases per 1,000 person-years for the most fit group. Person-years take into account the number of people in a study as well as the amount of time spent in the study. The case rate decreased as the level of fitness increased, with a rate of 8.5 for the second least fit group, 7.4 for the middle group and 7.2 for the second most fit group.

When researchers adjusted for other factors that could affect risk of Alzheimer’s disease, they found that the people in the most fit group were 33% less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease than those in the least fit group. The second most fit group was 26% less likely to develop the disease, while the middle group was 20% less likely and those in the second least fit group were 13% less likely to develop the disease than those in the least fit group.

“The idea that you can reduce your risk for Alzheimer’s disease by simply increasing your activity is very promising, especially since there are no adequate treatments to prevent or stop the progression of the disease,” Zamrini said. “We hope to develop a simple scale that can be individualized so people can see the benefits that even incremental improvements in fitness can deliver.”

A limitation of the study was participants were mostly white men so results may not be generalizable to other populations.

The study was supported by the National Institute on Aging, the National Institutes of Health, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the Washington D.C. VA Medical Center and George Washington University.","They did not have Alzheimer’s disease at the start of the study.

This means that Para athletes from these respective countries will no longer be allowed to participate in the Games which open on 4 March 2022.

Andrew Parsons, IPC President, said: “At the IPC we are very firm believers that sport and politics should not mix. However, by no fault of its own the war has now come to these Games and behind the scenes many Governments are having an influence on our cherished event.

“The IPC is a membership-based organisation, and we are receptive to the views of our member organisations.

“When our members elected the Board in December 2021 it was to maintain and uphold the principles, values, and rules of the Paralympic Movement. As Board members that is a responsibility and duty we take extremely seriously.

“In taking our decision yesterday we were looking at the long-term health and survival of the Paralympic Movement. We are fiercely proud of the principles and values that have made the Movement what it is today.

“However, what is clear is that the rapidly escalating situation has now put us in a unique and impossible position so close to the start of the Games.

“Yesterday we said we would continue to listen, and that is what we are doing.

“In the last 12 hours an overwhelming number of members have been in touch with us and been very open, for which I am grateful. They have told us that if we do not reconsider our decision, it is now likely to have grave consequences for the Beijing 2022 Paralympic Winter Games. Multiple NPCs, some of which have been contacted by their governments, teams and athletes, are threatening not to compete.

“Ensuring the safety and security of athletes is of paramount importance to us and the situation in the athlete villages is escalating and has now become untenable. First and foremost, we have a duty as part of the Paralympic mission, enshrined in the constitution, to guarantee and supervise the organisation of successful Paralympic Games, to ensure that in sport practiced within the Paralympic Movement the spirit of fair play prevails, violence is banned, the health risk of the athletes is managed and fundamental ethical principles are upheld.

“With this in mind, and in order to preserve the integrity of these Games and the safety of all participants, we have decided to refuse the athlete entries from RPC and NPC Belarus.

“To the Para athletes from the impacted countries, we are very sorry that you are affected by the decisions your governments took last week in breaching the Olympic Truce. You are victims of your governments’ actions.

“Athlete welfare is and always will be a key concern for us. As a result of today’s decision 83 Para athletes are directly impacted by this decision. However, if RPC and NPC Belarus remain here in Beijing then nations will likely withdraw. We will likely not have a viable Games. If this were to happen, the impact would be far wider reaching.

“I hope and pray that we can get back to a situation when the talk and focus is fully on the power of sport to transform the lives of persons with disabilities, and the best of humanity.”

Famine to rise five fold

Of extreme concern to humanitarians is the likelihood that the number of people experiencing “catastrophic”– or famine-like - levels of hunger, will increase five fold, from 31,000 now, to 161,000,by 31 December.

“These harrowing figures confirm that we are on a countdown to catastrophe in Yemen and we are almost out of time to avoid it,” said World Food Programme (WFP) Executive Director, David Beasley.

“Unless we receive substantial new funding immediately, mass starvation and famine will follow. But if we act now, there is still a chance to avert imminent disaster and save millions.”

Fight for Marib

The development comes as heavy fighting was reported over the weekend between Yemeni Government troops and Ansar Allah separatists – also known as Houthi forces – around the oil-rich northern city of Marib, which is still under government control, killing and wounding dozens of combatants.

The fighting took place as UN Special Envoy for Yemen, Hans Grundberg, ended his first week of consultations with key Yemeni parties in a push for a peaceful and sustainable future for the country which has been locked in escalating conflict since 2015.

Ahead of a High-Level Pledging Event on the Humanitarian Crisis in Yemen this Wednesday, the UN’s top aid official in Yemen, David Gressly, said in a tweet that funding was “urgently needed to sustain food and nutrition support, clean water, basic health care and protection. Parties to the conflict can reduce aid reliance by reducing restrictions on the economy.”

The warning from the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF), WFP and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), followed a surge violence across Yemen, which left at least 47 children killed or maimed in January and February.

Lacking the basics

After seven years of fighting, “many households in Yemen are deprived of basic food needs”, said Qu Dongyu, Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).

In a search for solutions, the FAO chief added that the agency was working “directly with farmers on the ground to foster their self-reliance through a combination of emergency and longer-term livelihood support, to build up their resilience, support local agrifood production, and offset people’s reliance on imports”.

Empty stomachs

Highlighting the long-lasting, negative impact on children, UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell warned that “more and more children” were “going to bed hungry” in Yemen.

“This puts them at increased risk of physical and cognitive impairment, and even death,” Ms. Russell added. “The plight of children in Yemen can no longer be overlooked. Lives are at stake.”

For 2022, UNICEF alone requires $484.4 million to respond to the humanitarian crisis in Yemen.

According to the latest food insecurity analysis, there’s been a rise in acute malnutrition among children under five in Yemen, and new mothers.

Across the country - already one of the world’s poorest before conflict escalated - 2.2 million children are now acutely malnourished; an additional 500,000 youngsters face severe acute malnutrition, which is a life-threatening condition.

Among the worst-hit governorates are Hajjah, Hodeida and Taizz.

Pregnant or nursing mothers are also at risk from the dire lack of food, with around 1.3 million acutely malnourished, according to the new Integrated Phase Classification (IPC) analysis on Yemen, released on Monday.

“The resounding takeaway (of the IPC findings) is that we need to act now,” said Mr. Gressly, UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen. “We need to sustain the integrated humanitarian response for millions of people, including food and nutrition support, clean water, basic health care, protection and other necessities.”

Violence to blame

Conflict is widely blamed for creating Yemen’s disastrous economic slide in recent years – and for driving up hunger levels - as the Yemeni Rial’s depreciation pushed food prices in 2021 to their highest levels since 2015.

Albeit happening thousands of miles away, the Ukraine crisis prompted by the Russian invasion is expected to lead to “significant import shocks” and higher prices, as 30 per cent of Yemen’s wheat imports come from Ukraine.

“Peace is required to end the decline, but we can make progress now,” insisted Mr. Gressly. “The parties to the conflict should lift all restrictions on trade and investment for non-sanctioned commodities. This will help lower food prices and unleash the economy, giving people the dignity of a job and a path to move away from reliance on aid.”","#YemenCantWait pic.twitter.com/33TsWlyKHK World Food Programme WFP“These harrowing figures confirm that we are on a countdown to catastrophe in Yemen and we are almost out of time to avoid it,” said World Food Programme (WFP) Executive Director, David Beasley.

331,331,https://insightplus.mja.com.au/2022/6/aducanumab-for-alzheimer-disease-opinions-mixed-cost-crazy/,"Aducanumab for Alzheimer disease: opinions mixed, cost “crazy”","A HIGH-cost Alzheimer drug that virtually eliminates amyloid plaques but without convincing evidence of clinical benefits has divided Australian experts, as the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) considers an application for its registration.

Aducanumab, a monoclonal antibody, is considered the first disease-modifying Alzheimer therapy because it reverses ß-amyloid deposition – widely regarded as the most likely cause of the disease.

The drug was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in June 2021 – the first new treatment for Alzheimer disease (AD) in almost two decades. It is indicated for patients with mild cognitive impairment or dementia stage of disease.

However, the approval defied the advice of the FDA’s own expert panel, which found there was insufficient evidence that it slowed cognitive decline. Three committee members resigned in protest and the FDA commissioner was compelled to request an independent inquiry to determine whether manufacturer Biogen had undue influence over the drug’s approval process.

The pathway to aducanumab’s approval has been unconventional, to say the least.

Two global phase 3 trials of the drug, ENGAGE and EMERGE, were discontinued in March 2019, when an independent data monitoring committee found they were unlikely to meet primary endpoints.

Six months later, the company that produces aducanumab announced that new analysis of a larger dataset, which became available after the pre-specified futility analysis, showed that the drug reduced clinical decline in patients with early AD and that, on this basis, it would apply for FDA approval. The new positive results, the company said, were driven primarily by greater exposure to high dose aducanumab in the larger dataset, as compared with data available when the trials were halted.

The FDA noted that while evidence from the updated EMERGE and ENGAGE studies were mixed, both “consistently and very convincingly reduced the level of amyloid plaques in the brain in a dose- and time-dependent fashion”.

“It is expected that the reduction in amyloid plaque will result in a reduction in clinical decline,” the FDA said.

On this basis, the FDA approved aducanumab through an “accelerated pathway”, which enables medications for serious or life-threatening illnesses to be approved based on a surrogate, rather than a primary clinical endpoint.

The FDA has given Biogen 9 years to conduct a post-approval clinical trial to verify the drug’s clinical benefit.

In the meantime, aducanumab is costing Americans US$28 200 per patient per year (AUD$40 000).

In a critical Perspective published in the MJA, Australian experts, led by Professor Ashley Bush, Director of the Melbourne Dementia Research Centre at the Florey institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health, likened the evidence underpinning the FDA’s decision to “winning a Texas sharpshooter contest by drawing a bull’s-eye around a bullet hole”.

“Premature approval without evidence of clinically meaningful benefit from controlled clinical trials is costly to government as well as patients (who are exposed to side effects), may make it harder to recruit to experimental placebo-controlled clinical trials, and could divert research funding away from the development of more effective treatments,” they wrote.

“Disease-modifying therapies for AD are urgently needed, but science, not desperation, should guide the approval process,” they added.

Speaking with InSight+, Professor Bush said he no longer believed anti-amyloid therapies held much promise.

“There have been over 30 phase 3 clinical trials targeting amyloid, and many have removed amyloid, but even with aducanumab, which very effectively removes amyloid, the clinical benefits are even more subtle than with the available drugs – acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and the [N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA)] antagonist memantine,” he said.

“Aducanumab also takes much longer to work than the medicines already available, with a slight slowing of deterioration after 18 months treatment, if the data can be believed.”

Professor Bush noted aducanumab was strongly associated with a poorly understood but potentially serious adverse event known as amyloid-related imaging abnormality (ARIA), which can cause brain bleeds.

The most common, oedematous form of the condition, ARIA-E, occurred in 35% of the treatment cohort, compared to 3% on placebo. Professor Bush said this had the effect on “unblinding” 35% of the cohort, potentially influencing the results of the two trials.

Professor Bush commented:

“There are concerns about the tendency of anti-amyloid drug candidates to accelerate brain volume loss, but this data has not been reported by either Biogen or the FDA, despite it being a pre-specified endpoint.”

Aducanumab is just one of a number of anti-amyloid drugs for AD, with ongoing trials of lecanemab and donanemab.

“We have to be open minded about the possibility that removing amyloid could be beneficial, but it also might not be, and there may still be better therapeutic targets, such as tau or iron deposition,” said Professor Bush.

In contrast, Professor Ralph Martins, Foundation Chair in Ageing and Alzheimer’s Disease at Edith Cowan University and Professor of Neurobiology at Macquarie University, said he and many colleagues remained strongly convinced of the amyloid hypothesis and hoped aducanumab would soon be approved in Australia and listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.

“There is a huge amount of evidence in the literature to support the amyloid hypothesis,” he said.

“For example, people with Down syndrome who commonly go on to get dementia have an extra copy of the amyloid gene, and there are also two major genes intimately linked to the amyloid pathway – APP and PS1 – and these occur in a vast majority of familial onset cases.”

Professor Martins said there was a convincing explanation for why aducanumab had not been linked with dramatic clinical improvements in trials, despite clearing amyloid.

“It is because of the cascade of events that contribute to AD,” he said. “The amyloid deposition comes first, which triggers a series of events, such as tau build-up, and once those events take place, the brain can be damaged irreparably.”

“The horse has already bolted for many patients in the clinical trials,” he said, “However, anti-amyloid therapies are likely to be most useful in early stage and particularly pre-clinical AD.”

Professor Martins said the FDA had rightly recognised the urgent burden of AD, and that aducanumab was effectively targeting the disease’s underlying biology.

“Maybe the approval was a bit too early, but when do we start?” he said. “If you ask families, everyone would say they want it now.”

Professor Martins said patients required a [positron emission tomography (PET)] amyloid scan to confirm the presence of amyloid before undergoing aducanumab therapy. They should also undergo [magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)] monitoring to look for ARIA, with closer monitoring of patients with the APOe4 gene because they were at increased risk of side effects.

If aducanumab becomes available in Australia for patients with mild AD, it is estimated that around 150 000 Australians would be eligible.

Professor Bush and colleagues estimated that if all of these patients were treated under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS), PBS expenditure would increase by about 50%. Real costs would be much higher, they said, taking into account resources needed for infusions, MRI monitoring, and management of adverse events.

One thing the Australian experts do agree on is the cost of the drug.

Professor Martins said the drug’s price tag had been a sour point for many doctors who welcomed the FDA approval.

“It’s just crazy, unacceptable,” Professor Martins said. “Many medical centres in the US have been choosing not to use aducanumab in protest against its cost, and I’m hoping that will have a positive effect in bringing the cost down, together with the release of some even more powerful anti-amyloid drugs that are now in the pipeline,” he said.

A TGA spokesperson said the independent expert Advisory Committee on Medicines was scheduled to consider Biogen Australia’s application in April, with the TGA to make a regulatory decision later in 2022.

Image source, Constantinis/Getty Images Image caption, It's normal to feel upset about what's happening in Ukraine, according to experts

If you woke up this morning, looked at the news, and felt increasingly worried about the war in Ukraine, you are not alone. After a two-year pandemic, it's a lot to absorb, and experts agree that feeling overwhelmed is normal.

Here is their advice on how you can take care of yourself, your kids - and others.

What you can do to help yourself

While it's right to think first and foremost about the impact on those caught up in the conflict, it's also completely normal to feel upset from afar by what we're seeing in Ukraine, says Alex Bushill, from the mental health charity Mind.

""It's very natural to be distressed by what we're seeing, you wouldn't be human if you didn't,"" he says.

This doesn't always lead to anxiety, but the NHS and Anxiety UK agree on some key ways to avoid it: eat well, get outside, put your phone down, connect with people, rest. These are all pretty basic pieces of advice, but when you're stressed, they can be difficult to do consistently.

Alex says breaking it down into a two-step process can help. The first is to remove yourself from triggers so that you can practice mindfulness.

""Get yourself into a place where you can be in the moment - whether that's sport or walking the dog,"" he says.

The second step is to focus on self-discipline around specific techniques that work for you. ""Create the space to take a lunch break or play squash on a Tuesday with your mate - and to make sure you do that.""

Experts agree that if you're feeling anxious, avoid doomscrolling - the act of spending an excessive amount of time consuming negative news.

Clinical psychologist Dr Emma Hepburn says it's something we often do when faced with uncertainty, but instead of filling in the gaps with useful information, we can end up catastrophising.

""The way we seek clarity is to look for more information, but that often creates less clarity, cause we're seeing the same information again and again and it doesn't allow us to step back.""

She also points out that you're allowed to feel safe and be concerned. ""The two aren't mutually exclusive.""

Mind advises only looking at news and social media at certain times of the day, for a limited duration, and then doing something relaxing afterwards.

Alex also recommends being conscious of where you get your information: rely on trusted news sources, focus on facts rather that alarmist speculation, don't engage with graphic content.

""When I do it, I step away, and it clears my mind, [it works] because you're not thinking about things you can't control,"" he says.

Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Stepping away from the constant news cycle can help manage anxiety

Sarah Kendrick, clinical director with text support service Shout, says she is particularly concerned about young people, who are typically on their phones a lot and accessing news 24/7.

""Children and young people are texting in saying they're worried about war, some say it's keeping them awake at night,"" she says. ""They're up at night with access to their phones and with news alerts going off.""

The guidance that Shout has been giving out sounds simple - turn off your phone at night and don't feel like you have to keep looking at the news - but it can be hard to put into practice.

""We always say, try to remember what we can control, and you can certainly control the amount of media you consume and how much sleep you have and how much you reach out for support.""

What you can do for your kids

The first thing to know is that avoiding the topic can make children feel scared, says Ane Lemche, a psychologist and child counsellor with Save the Children.

Prof Vivian Hill, from the British Psychological Society, recommends making the conversation age appropriate. For younger children, she suggests, this could be as simple as showing them where Ukraine is on a map, so they understand it's happening somewhere far away from them. For older children, it might include providing some context.

But at any age, the key thing is to reassure them.

""Keep it as matter-of-fact as you can: explain that there have been wars all over the world in the past few years and we've been lucky that most of them haven't had any impact on families in the UK - it's a good way of helping them to have a sense of the degree of risk that's posed to them,"" says Prof Hill.

""And that's what children want reassurance about - that they're safe.""

If they are worried about people in Ukraine, she suggests talking about the measures they are taking to protect themselves. ""You talk to them about how most people are in air raid shelters and away from the bombs, or you may talk about how people are moving to other countries where it's safer.""

If parents themselves are feeling anxious, children can pick up on that, so it's important adults get support too, she adds.

""If you're feeling really upset and your child asks you a question, say 'can we talk about this a little bit later'.

""And if you don't feel up to it, find someone else who can do it - you might have a partner or a member of extended family who's better at coping with that.""

She says it's normal for adults to feel ""wobbly"" post-pandemic and to wonder when there might be a period of stability. She recommends making sure there are ""protected times"" where there is no exposure to news, such as switching off the radio during the school run.

""The advice I'd give to children is just as much relevant to the adults. You have to try hard to guard time where you just have fun and escape all of the bleakness. It's about having compassion for everyone including yourself.""

What you can do for others

Helping others is one of the five steps recommended by the NHS to improve mental wellbeing and there are countless ways to help with the Ukraine crisis.

A number of charities have launched appeals, including the British Red Cross, the UNHCR refugee agency and Unicef, while many individuals across the UK are raising money and collecting donations independently.

Dr Hepburn says that watching war unfold can make you feel out of control, and focusing on ways to help can manage that.

""There's lots of evidence that doing something for other people has a really beneficial impact on your own mental health. If we perceive that we made someone else feel good, we feel good. Our brains are designed to be social and have connections and creating a connection with something bigger than you is really beneficial to your wellbeing.""

Dr Hepburn ""draws psychology"" and posts the images on her Instagram page, The Psychology Mum. Her most recent illustration is about how people can help with the Ukraine crisis.

""It's about making sense of a complex situation. And I guess it was me trying to do something as well.""

Shout, which is looking for volunteers, believes there are benefits for people on both ends of the phone.

""We've all found ourselves talking about this war to friends and family and there's a really big reason for that and that's because those conversations are comforting,"" explains Sarah.

""One of the great things about being involved in a service that helps other people is the sense of satisfaction or accomplishment you get, and that's what people are looking for.

""People can feel helpless in the face of war or big world events, and taking it back to the small things we can do is hugely enriching for people.""

Prof Hill says ""kids absolutely love"" finding positive ways to help others and recommends getting them involved.

""Injustice is something kids feel very strongly about, so get them to think about ways they can help the Ukrainian community,"" she says.

""There are people collecting donations, things to send to refugee centres, do something like that. Sometimes doing something constructive is really powerful.""","Ukraine conflict: How to help yourself, your kids, and others Published 1 March 2022Image source, Constantinis/Getty Images Image caption, It's normal to feel upset about what's happening in Ukraine, according to expertsIf you woke up this morning, looked at the news, and felt increasingly worried about the war in Ukraine, you are not alone.

Meanwhile, in patients with obstructive HCM, mitral regurgitation (MR), systolic anterior motion (SAM), and mitral annular calcification (MAC) are more common. These are the findings of a single-center, retrospective cohort study published in the Journal of the American Association.

HCM is a genetic disorder characterized by asymmetric left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, as well as a broad clinical and morphologic spectrum. MV disease is observed frequently in patients with HCM. Data on the prognostic implications of MV disease and its progression in individuals with HCM remain scarce, however. For the study, conducted at Yonsei University College of Medicine in Seoul, Korea, researchers evaluated the prognostic implication of MV disease and its progression in East Asian patients with HCM.

A total of 1193 patients who had been diagnosed with HCM in a single-center HCM registry between January 2005 and December 2016 were identified. An HCM diagnosis was based on “echocardiographic demonstration of a hypertrophied, nondilated LV in the absence of another cardiac or systemic disease that could produce a comparable magnitude of LV hypertrophy.” Following the exclusion of some patients, a total of 1185 individuals were ultimately included in the study. A total of 667 patients who received follow-up echocardiograms after 3 to 5 years were evaluated as well.

The mean age for participants was 60; 67% of the patients were men. The participants were classified into 2 groups, according to the presence of LV outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction: obstructive HCM (group 1; n=104) and nonobstructive HCM

(group 2; n=1081).

“ “C]areful assessment of MV functional abnormalities and detailed evaluation of MV anatomical features are needed to predict subsequent complications in patients with HCM.

In this study, LVOT obstructive was defined as “peak pressure gradient of the LVOT [of] ≥30 mm Hg on continuous-wave Doppler echocardiogram at rest or with physiologic provocation.” The progression of MR was defined as “the increase of at least 1 grade.” Clinical outcomes included a composite of cardiovascular death, heart failure hospitalization, MV surgery or septal myectomy (SM), and heart transplantation.

Overall, 23.5% (278 of 1185) of the participants exhibited at least mild MR on indexed electrocardiograms. Among patients with obstructive HCM, MR, SAM, and MAC all were more often reported. Over 7.0 years of follow-up, the presence of MR was independently associated with poor clinical outcomes (hazard ratio [HR], 1.60; 95% CI, 1.07-2.40; P =.023).

Based on follow-up echocardiograms performed 3 to 5 years later, 10.0% (67 of 667) of individuals in this analysis demonstrated MR progression, which was independently associated with a poor prognosis (HR, 2.46; 95% CI, 1.29-4.71; P =.007).

Several study limitations warrant mention. There are some situations where it may be a challenge to quantify MR in individuals with HCM — particularly when LVOT obstruction exists. Also, not all of the participants underwent provocation tests for the diagnosis of HCM, which could be linked to the underdiagnosis of obstructive HCM in this analysis. Further, participants with HCM were recruited from a tertiary hospital only, and individuals who had already undergone SM or MV surgery were excluded, which might create selection bias.

The researchers concluded, “The presence and progression of MR is a prognostic factor in the occurrence of poorer clinical outcomes; therefore, careful assessment of MV functional abnormalities and detailed evaluation of MV anatomical features are needed to predict subsequent complications in patients with HCM.”","Among East Asian patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), mitral valve (MV) disease is common, with the major type being nonobstructive.

By Hope Hamashige

For decades, the thinking about Alzheimer’s disease has been dominated by the so-called amyloid hypothesis which proposes that an abnormal accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques in various parts of the brain is the main driver of a cascade of events, leading to the loss of synapses and the death of neurons causing deficits in cognition and memory.

But as the search for an effective treatment continues, some scientists have begun exploring new ways of thinking about Alzheimer’s disease in the hope of finding new, more promising ways to prevent and treat this and other types of dementia.

One such researcher is Hussein Yassine, MD, an endocrinologist who treats patients with diabetes and lipid disorders. Lipids are organic compounds that are insoluble in water, such as fats and oils, and they serve different functions in the body. He is studying the role lipids in the brain may play in brain health.

“There is significant reason to believe it is not only the buildup of amyloid and that there are many other ways people can develop Alzheimer’s disease and other types of dementia,” said Hussein Yassine, MD, associate professor of medicine and neurology at the Keck School of Medicine of USC. “The system that keeps the brain healthy is complex and there are several ways that it can fail.”

The APOE4 gene and its link to system failures in the brain

Yassine has spent the past decade studying the role of a specific variant of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene, which is involved in lipid metabolism. APOE is a protein that makes lipids soluble in the blood and carries lipids in the body as high-density lipoprotein (HDL).

The variant, called APOE4, is a known risk factor for developing Alzheimer’s and is present in up to 50% of all people with Alzheimer’s dementia. The APOE gene has numerous roles in the brain and APOE4 is connected to several different types of system failure, all of which can put a person at risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease.

“In APOE4 carriers, it seems that when the system is stressed, a number of things can go wrong. The blood vessels can become leaky, inflammation can persist longer, the brain might not be getting the energy it needs from the rest of the body,” said Yassine. “APOE4 is also associated with low grade inflammatory processes within the brain, which was once believed to be a result of Alzheimer’s disease but is now recognized to be one of the drivers. There are many ways the system can get hit and we don’t think it is just one thing that can lead to Alzheimer’s. Some people with APOE4 may never get this disease, but with more hits, the system in APOE4 carriers starts to fail.”

APOE4’s impact on fatty acids in the brain

APOE4 also affects how fats and other nutrients, which are essential for proper maintenance of the brain, are delivered to the brain. It has been shown that APOE4, for example, can lead to break down of fatty acids, such as omega-3, which may explain why APOE4 carriers with Alzheimer’s lack certain omega-3 fatty acids in the brain and may not respond to supplementation once dementia develops. By understanding the variety of ways APOE4 may initiate the process of system failures in the brain, Yassine hopes to discover ways to intervene long before neurons die, preventing the development of Alzheimer’s and other dementias.

“We want to understand how APOE4 changes the brain from age 20 to 80 because a lot is happening in midlife that affects the aging brain,” said Yassine. “By the time people develop symptoms, it is too late for intervention, so we need to know what changes are taking place long before neurons begin to die.”

One focus of Yassine’s lab is understanding the mechanisms behind faulty lipid metabolism and neuroinflammation, in the hopes of identifying new treatment targets to prevent the development of Alzheimer’s. Yassine’s lab recently identified a protein known as cPLA2, which is involved in the development of neuroinflammation, that is activated in brains of APOE4 carriers who developed dementia.

The search for new treatments

Yassine’s team is collaborating with colleagues at the USC School of Pharmacy, and the Departments of Quantitative and Computational Biology and Chemistry at USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences to find drugs that might inhibit cPLA2. An effective cPLA2 inhibitor could be a potential treatment to curb neuroinflammation and improve the brain uptake of fatty acids in APOE4 carriers.

They have also launched a clinical trial, called PREVENTE4, to test whether giving people with APOE4 high doses of omega-3 fatty acid supplements can prevent or curtail cognitive decline before Alzheimer’s disease develops.

It has been proven that APOE4 oxidizes omega-3s and that low levels of the long-chain omega-3 fatty acids DHA and EPA increase the risk of Alzheimer’s disease. In earlier studies, Yassine’s team found that cognitively healthy participants who took omega-3 supplements had 200 percent more DHA in their blood compared to the control group and 28 percent more in the cerebrospinal fluid, a measure of brain uptake. However, APOE4 carriers had lower increases in brain DHA and EPA than non-carriers after supplementation.

In addition, Yassine is studying HDL particles, the so-called good cholesterol, which doctors routinely test for in patients’ blood, but not in the brain. Yassine’s team helped develop an assay to measure HDL in the brain and found that it correlates with cognitive function. They have since identified a protein that increases HDL in blood and are trying to figure out if reengineering this protein can lead to a new treatment to increase the formation of brain HDL.

Yassine also combines his expertise as an endocrinologist with his interest in Alzheimer’s disease to explore the connection between diabetes and Alzheimer’s disease. Most recently, he published a review on the utilization of a class of diabetes drugs known as glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists, which, appear to have significant neuroprotective effects and are being evaluated as treatments for Alzheimer’s disease.

Yassine is starting a clinic for dementia prevention in the Department of Neurology at the Keck School that will focus on APOE4 carriers and others at high risk for dementia. Yassine will use his clinical background in endocrinology and nutrition to help patients with personalized recommendations on diet, lifestyle, lipids, blood pressure, and sugar control with the goal of promoting vascular health and brain health.

Ultimately, he hopes to create a Center for Personalized Brain Health with distinct expertise in APOE4 research, training and education and clinical trials. The center would also provide carriers of APOE4 with personalized, tailored clinical care through the course of their adult lives that could potentially help prevent Alzheimer’s disease.

“There is a lot more research that needs to be done, but we are making tremendous progress,” said Yassine. “There is definitely reason to be hopeful. And the more research we do, the more we are going to be able to develop new treatments to help APOE4 carriers avoid developing this devastating disease.”","“In APOE4 carriers, it seems that when the system is stressed, a number of things can go wrong.

Staying Healthy This Winter

Feeling sick can be especially concerning these days. Could your sniffles be caused by COVID-19? Or the flu? A cold? Or maybe allergies?

Determining the cause of an illness can be tricky because many share some symptoms. They can leave you sniffling, coughing, and feeling tired. But there are important differences.

Figuring out what’s making you sick can help you recover and prevent spreading sickness to others.

Flu vs COVID-19

“Distinguishing COVID from flu can be difficult because the symptoms overlap so much,” explains Dr. Brooke Bozick, an NIH expert on respiratory diseases that affect the lungs.

Flu and COVID-19 are caused by different viruses that can be spread among people. Flu is caused by the influenza virus. COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2. Both can give you a fever, cough, headaches, and body aches.

Flu and COVID-19 also spread similarly. They’re transmitted by small particles that come from your nose and mouth when you sneeze, cough, sing, or talk, raising the possibility of infecting people who are nearby. Infected people may not have symptoms, but can still pass along either virus.

“Both influenza and COVID can be spread to other people before individuals develop symptoms,” notes Dr. Aubree Gordon, an infectious disease expert at the University of Michigan.

COVID-19 symptoms can take longer than flu symptoms to develop, she explains. Someone with flu usually has symptoms 1 to 4 days after being infected. A person with COVID-19 typically shows symptoms about 5 days after infection, although this can range from 2 to 14 days.

One telling sign of COVID-19 in some cases is loss of smell or taste. But because of other similar symptoms, there’s really only one way to be certain if you have COVID-19 or flu: Get tested.

“You can go and get a COVID test at many pharmacies, and your doctor can administer tests for flu,” Bozick says. COVID-19 tests are also available at many health centers. And you can buy testing kits approved for use at home.

Could It Be a Cold? Or Allergies?

Like flu and COVID-19, colds are also caused by viruses and can be passed to others.

Symptoms of a cold tend to be mild. You may have a runny nose, cough, congestion, and sore throat. But you won’t usually have the aches and fever that are common with COVID-19 and flu. Often, you’ll feel better in a couple of days.

There’s no cure for the common cold. Typical treatments include rest, fluids, and over-the-counter medicines. Some complementary treatments may help with cold symptoms, too. Taking honey may help with nighttime cough for children over 1 year old. Rinsing your nose and sinuses can help with congestion. You can use a neti pot or other nasal rinsing device. Be sure to only use water that’s been properly processed, such as distilled or boiled water, not tap water. Nasal rinses can bring relief for both cold and allergies.

Allergies can cause a runny nose and sneezing. But they’re not contagious. If your eyes, nose, or ears itch, that also could be an allergy.

Exposure to things like dust, pets, and tree or grass pollen can trigger allergies, which are caused by the immune systemThe system that protects your body from invading viruses, bacteria, and other microscopic threats. overreacting.

Allergy symptoms tend to stop when you’re no longer exposed to the cause. Unless you have asthma, allergies typically do not cause breathing problems. Allergies can be treated with drugs like antihistamines, decongestants, and nasal steroids.

Wintery Mix of Viruses

Winter is the prime cold and flu season. You’re more likely to be indoors and closer to others when it’s colder outside. Weather also plays a role in the spread of viruses.

“Cold and flu viruses survive better and are more transmissible if it’s cooler and if there’s lower humidity,” Gordon explains.

Experts are concerned that flu and COVID-19 cases may increase and overlap in the winter. Flu cases usually start to increase around October and peak between December and February. Being infected with flu and SARS-CoV-2 at the same time is possible, as is showing symptoms of both.

If you’re sick with the flu, your doctor may prescribe antiviral drugs. Such drugs can make your flu milder and shorten the time you are sick. They work best if they’re used early in your illness.

The FDA has also approved one antiviral drug, called remdesivir, to treat COVID-19. Other treatments are in development and under review. No complementary approaches have been shown to be helpful for fighting off flu or COVID-19.

Fortunately, strategies to prevent the spread of COVID-19 also prevent the spread of flu and cold. “Measures like masking and social distancing work for other respiratory viruses, as well as COVID-19,” says Dr. Chip Walter, who studies vaccine development at Duke University.

Staying Well

There’s another really important way to fight viruses. “Get your flu shot and COVID-19 vaccine,” Walter advises. They are safe and effective ways to protect yourself and those around you.

Don’t forget to vaccinate your children, too. That is the best way to protect their health. COVID-19 vaccines are now recommended for everyone age 5 years and older.

Flu vaccines are recommended for everyone 6 months and older. Flu vaccines are designed to protect against the four types of flu viruses that scientists expect to circulate that year.

Researchers like Walter and others are working to develop flu vaccines that last longer and offer broader protection against many flu strains.

Masks continue to be an important tool for stopping the spread of respiratory viruses, such as COVID-19. “With the pandemic still ongoing, it’s going to be really important that people wear masks,” Gordon says. Try to avoid crowded indoor situations when possible, too.

HONG KONG, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Hong Kong independent online publication Citizen News said on Monday its decision to shut down was triggered by the closure of a pro-democracy media outlet last week following a police raid and seven arrests.

Stand News, a prominent pro-democracy news site, closed last week after 200 police officers raided its newsroom, froze its assets and arrested seven people on suspicion of conspiring to publish seditious material.

Citizen News said on Sunday it will cease operations from Tuesday, describing the media environment in the Chinese-ruled city as ""deteriorating,"" and citing the need to ensure the safety of its staff.

""The decision was made within a short period of time. The trigger point was the fate of Stand News,"" Chris Yeung, chief writer at Citizen News and former president of the Hong Kong Journalists Association, told reporters.

""We could not rule out that ... we might be exposed to some risks.""

Established in 2017, Citizen News described itself as independent, with no party affiliation and promoting freedom, openness, diversity and inclusion. It had 40 employees.

Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with the promise that wide-ranging individual rights, including a free press, would be protected. But rights groups and some Western governments say freedoms have been eroded, in particular since Beijing imposed a national security law on Hong Kong in 2020.

Hong Kong's government denies targeting the media and curbing freedoms in the global financial hub. China says rights advocacy is being used as an attempt to disrupt Hong Kong's progress after the security law restored stability.

Stand News was the most prominent remaining independent pro-democracy publication in Hong Kong after a national security investigation in June 2021 led to the closure of jailed tycoon Jimmy Lai's Apple Daily newspaper.

Two former senior editors of Stand News were charged on Thursday with conspiracy to publish sedition materials and denied bail.

341,341,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-russia-invasion-economic-impact-united-states/,How the Ukraine crisis is already hitting Americans' wallets,"U.S. and allies impose new sanctions on Russia as tensions escalate in Eastern Europe

Although many Americans may prefer that the U.S. stay out of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the brewing violence and political fallout are already hurting their wallets.

The price of oil, which has been rising over the past year, hit an eight-year high this week as traders reacted to geopolitical tensions. Gas prices are likely to surge even further if the hostilities escalate or if U.S. lawmakers pass another round of sanctions, according to experts.

The economic impact could also move beyond the gas pump, Wall Street analysts warn. Sanctions or export controls against Russia could make current semiconductor shortages even worse, while restrictions on wheat or metals could drive the fiercest bout of inflation in decades to climb even higher.

""Shock waves across America""

Russia is a major exporter of crude oil, accounting for about 12% of the world's supply. Any disruption to those exports is likely to drive prices at the pump higher for consumers, experts said.

""If Russia makes a run on Ukraine, we could see [oil prices] over $100 a barrel next week,"" said Patrick DeHaan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, adding that average gas prices across the U.S. are likely to hit $4 a gallon in the weeks or months to come.

""That $4 is something we haven't seen in so long — it would cause shock waves across America,"" he said.

A key factor in how hard the conflict hits the economy will be how Russia responds to the U.S. sanctions that President Biden outlined Tuesday afternoon. Mr. Biden moved to cut off two Russian banks, and the state's sovereign debt, from western financing, while individuals will also be targeted.

Russia could retaliate by halting oil and natural gas exports, DeHaan said. That would put pressure on gasoline and natural-gas prices in the U.S., which have already spiked this year.

""The world economy does depend on global energy. How does the world sanction Russia's economy without Russia saying, 'We're going to take the next step for you and not export any more energy'?"" he asked. ""If Russia's economy is going down the tubes, they're going to take the global economy with it.""

The White House is considering another release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the Washington Post reported Tuesday, and U.S. officials are planning to divert more natural gas to Europe.

Another hit to supply chains

Although oil is Russia's most important export, both Russia and Ukraine are also large agricultural suppliers, sending wheat, rye, barley and other grains to Central Asia and the Middle East. Disruptions in commodities could send global food prices higher, putting pressure on U.S. consumers.

Russia also produces just under half of the world's palladium and smaller portions of platinum and nickel — key elements in complex microchips that are used in ""everything from electrical meters to sophisticated BMWs,"" said RSM Chief Economist Joe Brusuelas. Russia is also a major producer of aluminum.

Ukraine is Europe's top producer of uranium and has vast deposits of titanium, manganese, iron and mercury, Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, said in a report.

""Because commodity prices are as high as they are, any disruptions will really matter,"" he said.

To be sure, supply-chain snags have plagued U.S. consumers since nearly the start of the coronavirus pandemic, leading to long waits for goods like cars, electronics and furniture and pushing up their prices. But experts point to rising tensions as a factor that could worsen these long-standing issues.

""What we're talking about is another round of supply shocks in the developed economies,"" Brusuelas said.

Bottlenecks in critical metals could worsen the current semiconductor shortage and further push up prices of cars, electronics and other big ticket items. Along with rising commodity and energy costs, that threatens to make today's price increases even worse for many consumers.

More inflation, slower growth

Rising prices for commodities would leave U.S. consumers paying more for fuel and other necessities, leaving less money for discretionary spending.

""As costly as another European war would be in human and economic terms, its economic burden in the United States would fall hardest on the middle and working classes,"" Brusuelas said.

While prices spiked during the coronavirus pandemic, consumers were able to weather the shock thanks to enhanced unemployment benefits, federal stimulus payments and tax credits from the U.S. government.

In the case of a full-fledged war in Ukraine or harsher sanctions on Russia, the shock to energy prices and reduced consumption could bring down U.S. economic growth by 1%, Brusuelas said.

""Should energy prices increase more than our baseline expectation of 20% to, say, near 40%, we will be talking about a premature end of the business cycle,"" he noted.

Jittery stock markets



The conflict is also rattling markets around the world. Wall Street analysts expect U.S. stock indices, fresh off record highs last month, to remain volatile for the duration of the conflict.

""As today's turnaround in global markets highlights, perceptions about the risks around the conflict in Ukraine have become an increasingly important factor over the past few weeks,"" Jonathan Petersen, markets economist at Capital Economics, said in a report. ""Since the start of February, oil and safe-haven assets (such as gold and US Treasuries) have appreciated, while equities and some currencies (e.g., Russian equities and the ruble) have come under pressure.""

Market upheavals are likely to have limited effect on most Americans, since only a small portion of the population owns stocks. For those who do, however — especially workers with 401(k)s or IRAs in the stock market — the turbulence could put a dent in their portfolios in the short-term.

Stock market turmoil can also have a psychological effect, eroding consumer confidence and curbing spending, hitting economic growth.","U.S. and allies impose new sanctions on Russia as tensions escalate in Eastern EuropeAlthough many Americans may prefer that the U.S. stay out of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the brewing violence and political fallout are already hurting their wallets.

The preliminary results from an ongoing clinical trial found that infants whose families received an extra $4,000 in annual income were more likely to show brain activity patterns associated with the development of thinking and learning.

The findings come just weeks after the Child Tax Credit, which provided additional money to low-income parents, expired.

Previous research has shown that growing up in poverty has an impact on brain development, including lower rates of college attendance and high school graduation among children who grew up poor. In the past decade, dozens of studies have shown differences in brain matter and brain activity in both kids and adults living in poverty.

But the new study goes a step further, demonstrating the cause-and-effect link between poverty and brain development.

“All of the past work has been correlational,” said Dr. Kimberly Noble, a professor of neuroscience and education at Teachers College, Columbia University, who co-authored the study. “We could say based on past work that poverty is related to these differences, but we couldn’t say poverty is causing these differences. From a scientific perspective, the only way to answer that question is through a randomized clinical trial.”

That clinical trial is the Baby’s First Years trial, the first of its kind. It started in 2018 with the goal of asking a simple question about a complicated issue: What impact does regular cash income for low-income families have on brain development of the children in these families?

Noble, along with researchers from six universities, recruited low-income women who had recently given birth in New Orleans; New York City; Omaha, Nebraska; and Minnesota’s Twin Cities. The mothers were randomized to receive either a debit card with a monthly gift of $333 or a nominal monthly gift of $20. This amounted to an extra $3,996 or $240 in annual income. There were no stipulations on how the money could be spent by the mothers, who are mostly Black and Latina.

By intervening in this way, the researchers are able to see whether or not there is a direct cause-and-effect link between cash support for low-income families and childhood development. The larger amount was chosen because it’s a feasible amount that could be included in policies that provide stipends to families living in poverty.

Throughout the four-year trial, the team will make yearly home visits to measure the children’s brain activity, have the mothers fill out a questionnaire and observe the mother and baby together.

Year one

Results from the first year of the trial were published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

These findings focused on brain activity in 435 one-year-olds in the study.

According to Noble, everyone has both slow and fast brain activity patterns. As kids get older, they tend to have more fast, or high frequency, brain activity. This fast brain activity early in childhood is associated with the subsequent development of skills needed for learning.

The babies in the families that received more money from the study had more of these fast brain waves compared to those in families that received the lower amount.

Dr. Joan Luby, a Samuel and Mae S. Ludwig professor of child psychiatry at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, said that brain development does not happen evenly across a lifespan.

Neuroscientists are beginning to home in on specific periods of time, particularly in early childhood, in which brain development happens rapidly, said Luby, who was not involved with the new study. During these times, the brain is extremely sensitive to environmental factors.

“There are windows of opportunity or vulnerability when the brain changes in response to the psychosocial environment. It’s important to enrich, not deprive, children during these crucial periods of time,” she said. The cash support given in trial “provides families living in poverty with the resources that they can use to provide food, get child care, give the parents a little bit of latitude so they can potentially spend more time with their child. Those are all the things this small cash infusion does during this very critical period of time.”

The research team is working to gather more information about how the money was spent and what circumstances may have led to the changes in brain activity. But because the trial was randomized and controlled, “we know that the $333 per month must have changed children’s experiences or environments, and that their brains adapted to those changed circumstances,” Noble said.

Luby said that the data couldn’t have come at a better time.

The Child Tax Credit, which provided low-income families with up to $300 a month per child as a part of President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, expired Jan. 14, with the Senate unable to come up with an agreement on whether to extend the support.

Cash subsidies play an important role in addition to funds specifically allocated for food or child care, experts say.

“The power of cash is that it can be used as the family needs it in the moment, to fix the car or buy diapers. It’s a powerful way to empower people to take care of themselves and that’s critical when it comes to taking care of kids,” said Katherine Magnuson, director of the Institute for Research on Poverty at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who also co-authored the study.

“Economic resources are a way parents invest in their children. You can’t just think of it as the adults who are or are not getting the money, we have to take a child-focused lens to how we think about supporting families,” she said.

According to Dr. Martha Farah, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Pennsylvania and director of the Center for Neuroscience and Society, who was not involved with the research, the initial results already illustrate subtle differences in brain activity that indicate differences in cognitive and emotional development.

“The most important findings will come in the future, when the kids are grown enough to show everyone their cognitive and linguistic abilities, their self-control and other important achievements of early development,” she said.

A campaign to raise awareness of the bowel conditions Crohn’s and Colitis has been launched as study shows cases are rising.

Crohn’s disease and Ulcerative Colitis - commonly referred to as Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) - are long-term conditions which inflame the gut.

The campaign comes as research from Crohn’s & Colitis UK shows the rates of IBD are higher than previously thought, with Scotland found to have the highest rates in the UK.

Symptoms include a sore stomach, recurring diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme tiredness, which if not treated can lead to complications.

The campaign will raise awareness of the symptoms with posters and leaflets in GP surgeries and community centres, as well as social media, urging anyone who is concerned to contact their GP practice.

Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, Humza Yousaf said:

“Raising awareness of Crohn’s and Colitis is crucial to ensure we can get people diagnosed as early as possible, and give them the right care and treatment.

“This will help them to get the best support, make informed choices about their diet - and live their lives to the full.

“As part of the Modernising Patient Pathways Programme from the Centre of Sustainable Delivery, improvements have already been made for patients with IBD and we will continue working with the third-sector and people with the condition to make sure this important work continues.”

Sarah Sleet, CEO of Crohn’s & Colitis UK said:

“We know that there are over 50,000 people in Scotland living with Crohn’s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis but too many take too long to get diagnosed. For one in four, it’s over a year and nearly half of them end up in A&E in the meantime. Recognising the symptoms of Crohn’s and Colitis, which are widely misunderstood, and having the confidence to talk to a healthcare professional are the first steps on the path to a diagnosis.

“We’re thrilled that the Scottish Government is leading the rest of the UK in raising public awareness of Crohn’s and Colitis, to improve the lives of everyone affected.

“Our message is simple: if you have frequent diarrhoea, stomach pain or blood in your poo, don’t suffer in silence, go and see your GP. The earlier you find out what’s wrong, the sooner you can get the help you need.”","Campaign to highlight symptoms of Crohn’s and Colitis.

It is caused by a mutation in the gene that codes for a specific protein involved in the transportation of calcium and manganese ions from the cell cytoplasm and into a sac-like organelle called the Golgi apparatus. Scientists at Tohoku University, together with colleagues in Japan, have uncovered some aspects of this protein's structure that could help researchers understand how it works. The findings, published in the journal Science Advances, help build the foundations for research into finding treatments for Hailey-Hailey disease and other neurodegenerative conditions.

The protein the team studied is called secretory pathway Ca2+/Mn2+-ATPase, or SPCA for short. It is located in the Golgi apparatus, a cellular sac-like structure that plays a crucial role in protein quality control before they are released into cells. The Golgi apparatus also acts like a sort of calcium ion storage container. Calcium ions are vital for cell signalling processes and are important for proteins to function properly, so maintaining the right calcium ion balance inside cells is necessary for their day-to-day activities. In addition to calcium ion transport, SPCA is also involved in preventing the toxic build-up of manganese inside the cell cytoplasm, which can affect the survival of nerve cells. Until now, scientists have not known much about SPCA's structure or how it works.





""Our study succeeded in determining high-resolution 3D structures of human SPCA1a using a cryo-electron microscopy technology,"" says Tohoku University structural biologist Kenji Inaba, who led the research. ""The analysis revealed how SPCA1a binds to calcium and manganese ions and transports them into the Golgi lumen. We also mapped where mutations on the protein can cause functional defects and eventually lead to Hailey-Hailey disease. Thus, the knowledge about the mechanisms of SPCA1a regulation revealed by our study will be of physiological and medical significance.""





Cryo-electron microscopy studies samples frozen at very low temperatures, with the protein molecular motions immobilised. Proteins normally move and change shape as they go about their normal functions, but whatever the microscope captures can only reveal one specific state. The Tohoku study used the technique to elucidate three of the protein's states: as it is bound to calcium and manganese ions, as it is bound to the energy-providing molecule ATP, and in its metal-unbound phosphorylated state. So it gave three snapshots of states the protein would normally switch between.





""Although the study has provided many important insights into SPCA1a, it is not enough to describe the whole picture,"" explains Inaba. ""A comprehensive understanding of the transport of calcium and manganese by SPCA will reveal how these ions are properly balanced inside cells and could provide insights into how mutations in the protein cause Hailey-Hailey disease and other neurodegenerative disorders.""

In honor of Rare Disease Day, a global rare disease awareness initiative that takes place on the last day of February each year, Connecticut Children’s, The Jackson Laboratory and UConn Health co-hosted a virtual event entitled Voices of Patients, Researchers and Resources – a Rare Disease Day Forum.

The forum welcomed over 100 patients, families, researchers, and government officials who have an interest in empowering the rare disease community in Connecticut and beyond. The three-part discussion began with a welcome address from the event moderator, Connecticut Children’s Physician-in-Chief and Chair of the Department of Pediatrics at UConn School of Medicine, Dr. Juan Salazar, M.D., MPH, FAAP.

Physician researchers Gyula Acsadi, M.D., Ph.D., Ching Lau, M.D., Ph.D. and Rebecca Riba-Wolman, M.D., who hold appointments at the three institutions, discussed their work in rare disease research. The presentations focused on their expertise in spinal muscular atrophy, childhood cancers and glycogen storage disorders. A common element in the three experts’ work on these conditions was the use of gene therapy. Salazar, who holds a faculty position at UConn School of Medicine, noted, “This is no longer science fiction, this is real.”

Emily Germain Lee, M.D., Ph.D., who has an adjunct faculty appointment at JAX and joint appointment at Connecticut Children’s and UConn Health, followed with an introduction to a rare disease patient that she sees in clinic, John D’Allesandro. John lives with osteogenesis imperfecta, commonly known as OI or brittle bone disease. To open the conversation about his journey, Dr. Germain-Lee discussed an important research study that has led to a better understanding of OI: Mighty Mice in Space program. The collaborative Connecticut Children’s, JAX and UConn Health study sent genetically engineered “Mighty Mice” to the International Space Station to understand the effect on microgravity and bone loss. The results have important implications for possible therapeutic strategies for people suffering from disuse atrophy and diseases like OI.

While this research program provides hope to John and his wife Susan, they spoke about the challenges that they continue to face as a rare disease family, including financial hardships and the emotional impact the disorder has on their son, who also lives with OI. Despite these challenges, the D’Allesandros strive to do whatever they can to serve as examples of the benefits that research can have on future generations of people living with OI.

To conclude the program, Alicia Lawrence, LMSW, who is a patient services case manager at the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) shared a summary of resources that are available to rare disease patients and families in Connecticut. Lawrence highlighted NORD’s patient services programs, which provide financial assistance for some patients and their families, as well as advocacy programs for the rare disease community.

The virtual event provided a supportive forum for people to learn about rare disorders and the important research being conducted in Connecticut. Dr. Germain-Lee said, “The rare disease world has just blossomed. The progress that we’ve seen has been overwhelmingly transformational, especially in the past five years. I look to the future with so much hope. When I started in this field, I was hoping for little increments, and I’ve seen huge, giant steps.”","In honor of Rare Disease Day, Feb. 28, 2022, Connecticut Children’s, The Jackson Laboratory and UConn Health co-hosted a virtual event entitled Voices of Patients, Researchers and Resources – a Rare Disease Day Forum.

348,348,https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1555557/ph-heart-month-heart-disease-death-toll-dwarfs-covids,PH Heart Month: Heart disease death toll dwarfs COVID’s,"MANILA, Philippines—Heart is the most common symbol associated with the month of February, mainly due to the annual global celebration of Valentine’s Day.

However, in the Philippines, the heart is associated with the month of February not only because of the popular holiday for love but also to raise awareness of heart disease as a serious and growing health concern among Filipinos.

February was declared Philippine Heart Month by Proclamation No. 1096 signed on Jan. 9, 1973.

“[T]he heart is the seat of life, and the growing prevalence of heart cases among our people should be attended to with urgency. [T]here should be national awareness to this serious health problem through a program of emphasis and continuing research and education,” the proclamation read.

“[T]he true wealth of a nation is the health of its people and a nation can stand only as strong and healthy as its people are strong and healthy,” it added.

According to the Philippine Heart Association (PHA), the organization tasked with leading the annual observation along with the Department of Health (DOH) and the Heart Foundation of the Philippines, this year marks the 49th observation of the Philippine Heart Month.

“Heart month is PHA’s (Philippine Heart Association) oldest advocacy program. A traditional event that has withstood the test of time,” said cardiologist Dr. Ricky Tiongco in a recent online seminar hosted by PHA.

Kills more than COVID-19 in PH

Preliminary data released by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) in January showed that ischemic heart disease was the leading cause of death in the country from January to October 2021.

Ischemic heart disease, according to American Heart Association, refers to heart problems caused by narrowed heart arteries—which could then result in less blood and oxygen reaching the heart muscle.

It is also known as coronary artery disease and coronary heart disease, among types of cardiovascular diseases (CVD).

From January to October 2021, there were 110,332 deaths caused by ischemic heart disease, or 18.3 percent of total deaths in the Philippines.

The figures were 28 percent higher than the 86,164 deaths due to ischemic heart disease, or 16.9 percent of total deaths, in the same period in 2020.

“Cardiovascular disease is currently the number one cause of death in the Philippines. Responsible for about a third of all deaths each year,” said Dr. Maria Elizabeth Caluag, non-communicable disease division chief, Department of Health (DOH).

“In 2018, there were 186,622 deaths due to CVD. Even during the pandemic, CVD persisted to be the leading cause of death, killing more people than COVID-19 in 2021,” Caluag added.

Data from PSA showed that there were 51,514 deaths due to COVID-19, or 8.5 percent of total deaths during the first 10 months of 2021.

Understanding CVDs

According to Dr. Rodney Jimenez, treasurer and research committee chair of PHA, CVD is a range of diseases that affect the heart and blood vessels.

These groups of diseases are primarily caused by atherosclerosis or the build-up of plaque of bad cholesterol in blood vessels.

“Atherosclerosis blocks blood flow to the heart and to the brain, which can be fatal,” said Jimenez.

The lack of blood flow to the heart and to the brain could lead to heart attack or stroke.

The World Health Organization (WHO) listed types of disorders grouped under CVDs, which included:

coronary heart disease (ischemic heart disease): a disease of the blood vessels supplying the heart muscle

cerebrovascular disease: a disease of the blood vessels supplying the brain

peripheral arterial disease: a disease of blood vessels supplying the arms and legs

rheumatic heart disease: damage to the heart muscle and heart valves from rheumatic fever, caused by streptococcal bacteria

congenital heart disease: birth defects that affect the normal development and functioning of the heart caused by malformations of

the heart structure from birth

deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism: blood clots in the leg veins, which can dislodge and move to the heart and lungs

Jimenez also noted that CVD can be caused by risk factors that cannot be controlled like family history, age, and gender.

However, it can also be due to several risk factors that can be controlled, such as:

unhealthy diet (too fatty, too salty, too sweet)

lack of exercise

obesity (due to unhealthy diet and lack of exercise)

smoking or tobacco use (first-hand and second-hand smoke)

stress

harmful use of alcohol

“There are also a number of underlying determinants of CVDs. These are a reflection of the major forces driving social, economic, and cultural change – globalization, urbanization, and population aging,” said WHO.

“Other determinants of CVDs include poverty, stress, and hereditary factors,” it added.

Reduce risks of CVDs

To prevent the risk of getting CVDs, Jimenez recommended to the public the simple “5-2-1-0-0” prevention method. The method, as explained by Jimenez, included:

5 servings of fresh fruits and vegetables

2 grams of salt per day to reduce risks of high blood, stroke, and heart attack

1 hour of exercise daily or 1 minute of exercise every hour

0 smoking

0 sugared beverages

He also pointed out that prevention methods should begin at a young age.

“Heart disease starts during childhood because of the bad habits we acquire while we are young,” Jimenez said.

“Since heart disease has its roots in childhood, prevention should start among the young. It begins at home and school,” he added.

The National Health Service (NHS) in the United Kingdom (UK) likewise urged the public to make lifestyle changes—such as regular exercise and giving up smoking—to reduce the risk of getting CVDs.

It also suggested eating a healthy and balanced diet, being physically active, and controlling blood cholesterol and sugar levels.

In 2018, anatomists at the Toho University Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan, performed a sleep deprivation experiment on lab mice. Mice usually sleep for 12 hours a day. In this experiment, researchers induced sleep deprivation using the ‘gentle handling method’ during sleep hours so that the mice could sleep only for six hours daily.

They discovered that liver fat content in sleep-deprived mice increased without total weight gain compared to another group who were allowed to sleep normally. The liver cells were stressed, and the activity of certain genes that escalate insulin resistance and fat content within liver cells also increased with sleep deprivation.

Experiment on rats

Three years later, a group of Chinese researchers at the Xinjiang Medical University went one step ahead. In this experiment, rats were severely sleep-deprived, turning into insomniacs. Liver enzymes, blood, and liver fat increased substantially. None of these changes were notable among rats who were allowed to sleep without distractions.

They also found the reason for increased liver fat in insomniac mice — the sympathetic nerves that supplied the liver, best known for their role in responding to stress and danger, were hyperactive. When insomnia was treated with a sleeping pill in these stressed rats, the liver fat was reduced with adequate sleep.

There are lessons here, of mice and men. Sleep is an underrated activity among humans. Sometimes, the intentional and forced lack of sleep ‘to increase productivity’ is advertised by men in power to showcase their self-proclaimed metahuman nature. During an interview in 2011, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he had become a workaholic and hardly slept for 3.5 hours in a day, and that yoga and pranayama routine kept him energised and awake.

But medical science has a different story to tell. A study of nearly 55,500 people from Europe showed that those who slept 7-8.5 hours daily had higher life expectancy than those who slept less than seven hours. In those between ages 50 and 75 without sleep disturbances, the expectation of living longer without chronic disease development was significantly higher.

And yoga interventions improved overall sleep quality, efficiency, latency, and duration, contrary to all claims.

Healthy sleep

Sleep is a vital function of human life and accounts for up to one-third of the lifespan. Contrary to normal belief, during sleep, the brain is not ‘resting’ but is engaged in various activities necessary to improve well-being, increase life, and especially impact the liver. The minimum required duration for ‘healthy’ sleep is seven hours.

When 10,000 persons with sleep disorders were followed up for one year, incident fatty liver disease was noted in 14, while in those without sleep disorders, it was only six. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease association was significantly higher among persons with shorter sleep duration (less than six hours per night) and excessive daytime sleepiness. A high-quality study showed that inadequate sleep duration was strongly associated with an elevated risk of developing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and adequate sleep helped prevent it. With every one-hour decrease in sleep time from the recommended seven-eight hours, the risk of fat deposition in the liver increased by 24% compared with those who slept adequately.

However, when people who lost sleep during the weekdays caught up on the debt during weekends (known as weekend catch-up sleep), the development of fatty liver disease reduced significantly. Compared with non-nappers, long daytime nappers (more than 60 minutes) had a higher risk of developing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

Identification

Correlation may not be causation, but with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, which is associated with other conditions such as obesity, high blood pressure, increased waist-hip ratio, low functioning thyroid, and high blood cholesterol, studying and identifying independent associations make realistic sense.

In people who sleep less than six hours at night, have a persistently poor sleep quality, or nap more than one hour during the day, independent of other disease conditions, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease development was a strong association. The next time someone brags that sacrificing time and quality of sleep is an achievement associated with success, know that success comes with fatty liver disease. And it is not worth it.

Español

Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for a new monoclonal antibody for the treatment of COVID-19 that retains activity against the omicron variant. The EUA for bebtelovimab is for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kilograms, which is about 88 pounds) with a positive COVID-19 test, and who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death, and for whom alternative COVID-19 treatment options approved or authorized by the FDA are not accessible or clinically appropriate.

Bebtelovimab is not authorized for patients who are hospitalized due to COVID-19 or require oxygen therapy due to COVID-19. Treatment with bebtelovimab has not been studied in patients hospitalized due to COVID-19. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bebtelovimab, may be associated with worse clinical outcomes when administered to hospitalized patients with COVID-19 requiring high flow oxygen or mechanical ventilation.

“Today’s action makes available another monoclonal antibody that shows activity against omicron, at a time when we are seeking to further increase supply,” said Patrizia Cavazzoni, M.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “This authorization is an important step in meeting the need for more tools to treat patients as new variants of the virus continue to emerge.”

The issuance of an EUA is different than an FDA approval. In determining whether to issue an EUA, the FDA evaluates the totality of available scientific evidence and carefully balances any known or potential risks with any known or potential benefits of the product for use during an emergency. Based on the FDA’s review of the totality of the scientific evidence available, the agency has determined that it is reasonable to believe that bebtelovimab may be effective in treating certain patients with mild or moderate COVID-19. When used to treat COVID-19 for the authorized population, the known and potential benefits of these antibodies outweigh the known and potential risks. There are no adequate, approved and available alternative treatments to bebtelovimab.

The EUA for bebtelovimab is supported by clinical and nonclinical data. The clinical data are from a phase 2, randomized, single-dose clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of bebtelovimab alone and bebtelovimab combined with other monoclonal antibodies for treating mild to moderate COVID-19.

What you need to know:

Bebtelovimab works by binding to the spike protein of the virus that causes COVID-19, similar to other monoclonal antibodies that have been authorized for the treatment of high-risk patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 and shown a benefit in reducing the risk of hospitalization or death.

The FDA is carefully monitoring circulating viral variants and their sensitivity to authorized monoclonal antibodies, including bebtelovimab. Laboratory testing showed that bebtelovimab retains activity against both the omicron variant and the BA.2 omicron subvariant.

The placebo-controlled portion of the trial enrolled 380 low-risk patients (i.e., patients without risk factors for progression to severe COVID-19 illness). Patients in this part of the trial were randomized to receive a single infusion of bebtelovimab alone, bebtelovimab with other monoclonal antibodies or a placebo. Treatment with bebtelovimab resulted in a reduction in time to sustained symptom resolution compared to placebo. Reduction in viral load relative to placebo was also seen on Day 5 after treatment.

In another part of the trial involving mostly high-risk individuals (i.e. patients with risk factors for progression to severe COVID-19 illness), 150 patients were randomized to receive a single infusion of bebtelovimab alone or a single infusion of bebtelovimab with other monoclonal antibodies. An additional 176 high-risk patients received bebtelovimab with other monoclonal antibodies in an open-label treatment arm.

The rates of COVID-19 related hospitalization and death through Day 29 seen in those who received bebtelovimab alone or with other monoclonal antibodies were generally lower than the placebo rate reported in prior trials of other monoclonal antibodies in high risk patients. Conclusions are limited as these data are from different trials that were conducted when different viral variants were circulating and baseline risk factors varied.

Clinical data were similar for bebtelovimab alone as compared to the combination of bebtelovimab with other monoclonal antibodies.

Possible side effects of bebtelovimab include itching, rash, infusion-related reactions, nausea and vomiting.

Serious and unexpected adverse events including hypersensitivity, anaphylaxis and infusion-related reactions have been observed with other SARS-CoV2 monoclonal antibodies and could occur with bebtelovimab. In addition, clinical worsening following administration of other SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody treatment has been reported and therefore is possible with bebtelovimab. It is not known if these events were related to SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody use or were due to progression of COVID-19.

Under the EUA, fact sheets that provide important information about using bebtelovimab treating COVID-19 as authorized must be made available to health care providers and to patients and caregivers. These fact sheets include dosing instructions, drug interactions and potential side effects.

Bebtelovimab is not a substitute for vaccination in individuals for whom COVID-19 vaccination and a booster dose are recommended. The FDA has approved two vaccines and authorized others to prevent COVID-19 and the serious clinical outcomes associated with COVID-19, including hospitalization and death. The FDA urges the public to get vaccinated and receive a booster if eligible. Learn more about FDA-approved or -authorized COVID-19 vaccines.

The EUA was issued to Eli Lilly and Co.

SALT LAKE CITY — There are few who really know about Utah's Native American history and even fewer representing the tribes that lived on these lands. Yet, one man does both, and he's making a big difference within the west side community.

Across Interstate 15 on the west side of Salt Lake City sits Neighborhood House, a place for kids to go for before or after school programs.

Nate Manuel is a teacher there, in charge of the intergenerational student program for K-12 students.

""We just try to teach a lot of life skill activities,"" Manuel said.

Skills like art and cooking, but also understanding respect and knowing what to do when bullying occurs.

The greatest lessons Manuel has taught have come from who he is.

""He's kind,"" said Cassandra Miranda, who is one of Manuel's students.

Henry Acevedo, another student, has known Manuel for two years.

""He's a really nice guy, he's fun, he's cool,"" Acevedo said.

Manuel's students show him appreciation with greetings and hugs as he walks through the hallway at Neighborhood House — his main focus is being present for them because he's walked in their shoes.

""Sometimes, only person of color in the room, let alone being the only native,"" said Manuel. ""You're alone. And you do feel like, you're like the only one dancing in the rain.""

But Manuel shows his students how to keep dancing through life — that's been his story since day one.

Manuel's ancestry runs through two Native American tribes from Southern Arizona. Manuel grew up on the Tohono O'odham Nation Indian Reservation.

At 5 years old, Manuel moved to Salt Lake City where he went to school.

Later, Manuel coached girls' and boys' basketball at West and East high schools for more than a decade. He was also a part of other youth programs around the valley before landing at Neighborhood House.

The Neighborhood House started in 1894, specifically to help underprivileged kids with their education.

In 2020, they served nearly 400 kids, and half of them were in the school-age programs.

""More than anything, I want to do it for the kids,"" Manuel said.

For Manuel, it's all about helping the one in around 60,000 Native Americans throughout the Beehive State, with around 2,500 in the Salt Lake Valley.

Though they are small in numbers, Manuel believes there are more important things than representation — it's all about the land.

""We're just trying to reclaim our ancestral ways,"" Manuel said.

Part of reclaiming is educating, which is the main motivation for Manuel to teach his students how to grow their own garden. At the end of a harvest, Manuel said they made homemade salsa together to celebrate.

Manuel has also created a documentary, ""This Was the Place,"" about the natural tribal lands in the Beehive State and surrounding area.

All his efforts are focused on helping others understand his heritage.

His influence has extended to many within the west side community, making Manuel an advocate and leader for those in need, even though he has some needs of his own.

Students gather around Nate Manuel for a daily lesson in this undated photo. (Photo: Erin Cox, KSL-TV)

In 2020, Manuel started experiencing unexpected symptoms, but it wasn't until 2022 that doctors found out what was going on.

""I thought it was just a normal limp, but when I found out, I was like 'dang"" and I was sad,"" Acevedo said.

What doctors told Manuel was not comforting — he was diagnosed with ALS, or Lou Gehrig's Disease, a deadly disease that breaks down the nerve cells in your brain and back.

""They told me it's only a matter of time,"" Manuel said. ""So, when it comes to me having a time limit, I just want to be present.""

Present for his students and their future — after all, this isn't the first time Manuel has danced in the rain.

""It is challenging, but I'm still happy,"" Manuel said. ""I'm not going to let anybody take my happiness.""

Friends have created a GoFundMe* for Manuel and plan to hold an ""ice bucket"" challenge for him.

353,353,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/nathan-chens-history-making-gold-medal-significant-rcna15747,Why Nathan Chen’s history-making gold medal is so significant,"Figure skater Nathan Chen made history at the Beijing Olympics, becoming the first Asian American man to earn an Olympic medal in men’s figure skating singles. His win was a moment of pride, particularly for the Asian American community.

“My hope is that Nathan Chen’s historic win reminds us of the potential and the achievements of immigrants, their descendants, and Asian Americans in U.S. sports and Olympic history,” Catherine Ceniza Choy, author of the forthcoming book “Asian American Histories of the United States,” told NBC Asian America.

The 22-year-old has been poised to win gold after several years on top in the world standings. After a record-breaking score in the short program earlier this week, Chen delivered with another exceptional free skate, crediting fellow Asian American Olympic icon Michelle Kwan as his inspiration.

Experts pointed out that it’s especially poignant because of a history of gatekeeping of sports for Asian Americans.

Just over a century before Chen stepped onto the podium to accept his medal for the U.S. in front of the world stage, with the national anthem blaring from the speakers, people of Chinese descent were barred from any semblance of the American dream.

“Exclusion laws kept people of Asian descent out of the country and did not allow their naturalization. Those weren’t really taken away until after the Second World War,” Josephine Lee, professor of English and Asian American studies at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, said. “A lot of people still don’t know this history — that these were racial exclusions that kept the population of Asian Americans low.”

Not only was Chinese immigration stifled during the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 — which first put a 10-year moratorium on any Chinese labor immigration to the U.S. and was subsequently extended through additional policies well into the 1900s — Asian American participation in mainstream cultural institutions was not feasible whatsoever.

Choy explained that at the time, men in the community were seen as nonhuman, let alone American, “filthy, immoral, harbingers of disease.” Sports culture, she said, was primarily accessible through segregated sports leagues.

These spaces, while originating in the late 19th century, persisted well into the 1900s, historian Ellen Wu, author of “The Color of Success,” explained.

“Like all Americans, Asian Americans love sports, but certainly there was social segregation,” Wu said. “There is a history of Asian Americans forming their own sports leagues in basketball, tennis and bowling.”

Sports also became an arena in which Asian Americans mobilized, declaring their place in the United States. Wu explained that they organized, involving other marginalized groups in the process, to desegregate major bowling organizations.

However, Choy noted that many of the archaic stereotypes as perpetual foreigners have continued to linger, contributing to an underrepresentation of Asian Americans at the most elite levels of sport. And the spirit behind the exclusionary policies persists, even if they’re not explicitly codified, Lee said.

“Exclusion laws were repealed, so they don’t really exist in that kind of current state,” Lee explained. “But that anti-Asian feeling that both fostered the laws and then kind of grew.”

After all, Lee said, Chen’s win comes amid years of pandemic-fueled racism, built upon the centuries-old anti-Asian racism. His success, Lee cautioned, shouldn’t be interpreted as definitive proof of racial progress in the U.S. And as the pandemic-fueled violence shows, Asian Americans continue to contend with the trope that they aren’t part of the American fabric.

Wu added that perhaps Chen’s extraordinary, almost herculean abilities could have potentially mitigated Americans’ reluctance to accept someone of Asian descent as the face of U.S. figure skating.

“There are certainly people that did not really think of Michael Jordan as Black but just as this amazing, superhuman basketball player,” she said. “There’s something like you have to be so extraordinarily exceptional.”

Rather than painting Chen’s win as a racial victory, Choy said he stands as a symbol of skill and determination in the face of a history of anti-Asian bias.

With the win secured in China, Lee explained, Chen’s story is ultimately a meaningful one that captures the transnational histories of so many Asian Americans.

354,354,https://www.iea.org/news/global-co2-emissions-rebounded-to-their-highest-level-in-history-in-2021,Global CO2 emissions rebounded to their highest level in history in 2021,"Global energy-related carbon dioxide emissions rose by 6% in 2021 to 36.3 billion tonnes, their highest ever level, as the world economy rebounded strongly from the Covid-19 crisis and relied heavily on coal to power that growth, according to new IEA analysis released today.

The increase in global CO2 emissions of over 2 billion tonnes was the largest in history in absolute terms, more than offsetting the previous year’s pandemic-induced decline, the IEA analysis shows. The recovery of energy demand in 2021 was compounded by adverse weather and energy market conditions – notably the spikes in natural gas prices – which led to more coal being burned despite renewable power generation registering its largest ever growth.

The global CO2 emissions and energy demand numbers are based on the IEA’s detailed region-by-region and fuel-by-fuel analysis, drawing on the latest official national data and publicly available energy, economic and weather data. Combined with the methane emissions estimates that the IEA published last month and estimates of nitrous oxide and flaring-related CO2 emissions, the new analysis shows that overall greenhouse gas emissions from energy rose to their highest ever level in 2021.

The numbers make clear that the global economic recovery from the Covid-19 crisis has not been the sustainable recovery that IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol called for during the early stages of the pandemic in 2020. The world must now ensure that the global rebound in emissions in 2021 was a one-off – and that an accelerated energy transition contributes to global energy security and lower energy prices for consumers.

Coal accounted for over 40% of the overall growth in global CO2 emissions in 2021, reaching an all-time high of 15.3 billion tonnes. CO2 emissions from natural gas rebounded well above their 2019 levels to 7.5 billion tonnes. At 10.7 billion tonnes, CO2 emissions from oil remained significantly below pre-pandemic levels because of the limited recovery in global transport activity in 2021, mainly in the aviation sector.

Despite the rebound in coal use, renewable energy sources and nuclear power provided a higher share of global electricity generation than coal in 2021. Renewables-based generation reached an all-time high, exceeding 8 000 terawatt-hours (TWh) in 2021, a record 500 TWh above its 2020 level. Output from wind and solar PV increased by 270 TWh and 170 TWh, respectively, while hydro generation declined due to the impacts of drought, notably in the United States and Brazil.

The use of coal for electricity generation in 2021 was intensified by record high natural gas prices. The costs of operating existing coal power plants across the United States and many European power systems were considerably lower than those of gas power plants for the majority of 2021. Gas-to-coal switching pushed up global CO2 emissions from electricity generation by well over 100 million tonnes, notably in the United States and Europe where competition between gas and coal power plants is tightest.

The rebound of global CO2 emissions above pre-pandemic levels has largely been driven by China, where they increased by 750 million tonnes between 2019 and 2021. China was the only major economy to experience economic growth in both 2020 and 2021. The emissions increases in those two years in China more than offset the aggregate decline in the rest of the world over the same period. In 2021, China’s CO2 emissions rose above 11.9 billion tonnes, accounting for 33% of the global total.

China’s rise in emissions resulted largely from a sharp increase in electricity demand that leaned heavily on coal power. With rapid GDP growth and additional electrification of energy services, electricity demand in China grew by 10% in 2021, faster than economic growth at 8.4%. This increase in demand of almost 700 TWh was the largest ever experienced in China. With demand growth outstripping the increase in supply from low emissions sources, coal was used to meet more than half of the rise in electricity demand. This was despite the country also seeing its largest ever increase in renewable power output in 2021.

CO2 emissions in India rebounded strongly in 2021 to rise above 2019 levels, driven by growth in coal use for electricity generation. Coal-fired generation reached an all-time high in India, jumping 13% above its 2020 level. This was partly because the growth of renewables slowed to one-third of the average rate seen over the previous five years.

Global economic output in advanced economies recovered to pre-pandemic levels in 2021, but CO2 emissions rebounded less sharply, signalling a more permanent trajectory of structural decline. CO2 emissions in the United States in 2021 were 4% below their 2019 level. In the European Union, they were 2.4% lower. In Japan, emissions dropped by 3.7% in 2020 and rebounded by less than 1% in 2021.

On a per capita basis, CO2 emissions in advanced economies have fallen to 8.2 tonnes on average and are now below the average of 8.4 tonnes in China, although wide differences remain among advanced economies.","Coal accounted for over 40% of the overall growth in global CO2 emissions in 2021, reaching an all-time high of 15.3 billion tonnes.

Two years later, more than 6 million people have died.

“Although reported cases and deaths are declining globally, and several countries have lifted restrictions, the pandemic is far from over – and it will not be over anywhere until it’s over everywhere”, said WHO Director Tedros Adhanom Gebreyesus on Wednesday.

Deaths continue

Speaking to journalists in Geneva, Dr Tedros reminded the world that many countries in Asia and the Pacific are currently facing surges of cases and deaths.

“The virus continues to evolve, and we continue to face major obstacles in distributing vaccines, tests and treatments everywhere they are needed”, he said.

Avoid ‘two-tier recovery from COVID-19’

The UN Secretary-General issued a statement on Wednesday supporting the WHO chief’s assessment, that it would be ‘a grave mistake’ to think the virus was now in the rear-view mirror.

In a statement published on Wednesday, António Guterres reiterated that the distribution of vaccines remains “scandalously unequal”.

“Manufacturers are producing 1.5 billion doses per month, but nearly three billion people are still waiting for their first shot”, he highlighted.

The UN chief blamed this “failure” on policy and budgetary decisions that prioritize the health of people in wealthy countries, over the health of people in poor countries.

“This is a moral indictment of our world. It is also a recipe for more variants, more lockdowns and more sorrow and sacrifice in every country. Our world cannot afford a two-tier recovery from COVID-19”, he said.

Mr. Guterres added that despite the numerous other global crises, the world must reach the goal of vaccinating 70 per cent of people in all countries by the middle of this year.

“Science and solidarity have proven to be an unbeatable combination. We must re-dedicate ourselves to ending this pandemic for all people and all countries, and closing this sad chapter in humanity’s history, once and for all”, he emphasised.

New COVID ‘recombinant’ of Delta and Omicron

The WHO’s chief also expressed his concern over the ‘drastic reduction’ of testing in several countries.

“This inhibits our ability to see where the virus is, how it’s spreading and how it’s evolving”, he warned

Meanwhile, COVID-19 Technical lead, Maria Van Kerkhove, informed that the agency is aware of a ‘recombinant strain’ in Europe.

“It’s a combination of Delta AY.4 and Omicron BA.1 It has been detected in France, Netherlands and Denmark but there are very low levels of this detection”, she said, also emphasising the importance of testing and sequencing all over the world.

Dr. Van Kerkhove explained that the recombinant was expected given the high circulation of both Omicron and Delta.

“With the emergence of Omicron, in some countries, the wave of Delta had already passed so circulation was at a low level, but in other countries, in Europe for example, Delta was still circulating on a high level when Omicron emerged”, she detailed.

The expert highlighted that so far, scientists haven’t seen any change in the severity of COVID-19 with this strain, but that studies are still underway.

“Unfortunately, we do expect to see recombinants because this is what viruses do, they change over time. We are seeing intense levels or circulation; we see this virus impacts animals with the possibility of affecting humans again”, she warned.

Dr. Van Kerkhove called on countries to reinforce their surveillance and sequencing systems instead of “taking them apart to move on to the next challenge”. She also reiterated her call for the use of a layered approach to public health tools.

“The pandemic is far from over, not only do we need to focus on saving people’s lives we also have to focus on reducing the spread.

356,356,https://theconversation.com/uncovering-the-genetic-causes-of-fatty-liver-disease-a-growing-health-concern-176641,Uncovering the genetic causes of fatty liver disease — a growing health concern,"Over the past 40 years, changes in our urban environment and diet have had a major impact on our lifestyles.

We are more sedentary and the quality of our diet and sleep is at its lowest in decades. These changes, coupled with an increase in life expectancy, are associated with an increase in the number of people with “cardiometabolic” diseases such as Type 2 diabetes, heart diseases, certain cancers and even certain neurodegenerative diseases.

Another cardiometabolic disease that frequently flies under the radar is non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The liver is an important organ for food digestion, energy metabolism and nutrient management, and communicates with the intestine and the adipose tissue (the main component of our body fat). But non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is a fairly silent disease, as there are few or no symptoms associated with it.

Our lab uses human genetics to identify targets to treat and prevent non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and its complications.

Fatty liver disease and its consequences

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is a disease that affects, on average, one in four adults and nearly one in 10 children worldwide. The disease progresses from reversible to irreversible stages.

The first stage is defined by the presence of steatosis (excessive accumulation of lipids in the liver to at least five per cent of the total liver mass). The next stage, which is also reversible, is characterized by inflammation of the liver cells (called hepatocytes). This inflammation may be accompanied by scar tissue (called fibrosis).

The development of the disease to irreversible stages, in more severe cases, can lead to cirrhosis and/or liver cancer. By 2025, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease will be the leading cause of liver failure and transplantation. Its complications, however, are not limited to liver disease. It is strongly associated with several other cardiometabolic diseases such as Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases (the leading cause of death of those with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease).

What are the risk factors?

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease develops gradually and may progress differently from one individual to another depending on genetic factors and certain risk factors, including diet.

Consuming added sugar, such as fructose in sweetened beverages, may contribute to its development, by activating a metabolic process called “de novo lipogenesis”, the production of fatty acids from sugar. Ultra-processed products, common in the North American diet, have a high energy density and provide a high intake of sugar, fat and salt. Furthermore, alcohol consumption, even in the absence of alcoholism, could have a synergistic effect on liver metabolism and accelerate the progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

Being overweight is also risk factor for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: About half of obese individuals (people with a body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to 30) could develop the disease. However, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is frequently observed in people who have a “healthy weight.” Although BMI may have some utility in measuring the consequences of high body weight, its clinical utility is increasingly being questioned. BMI gives little or no information on the location of fat tissue: fat has much more harmful consequences when located in the abdomen than in the arms, hips or thighs.

Genetic factors

Our research team believes that identifying the genetic factors that contribute to chronic diseases such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease will allow us to understand, prevent and treat them better.

To this end, we have conducted the largest genetic study of this disease to date. We compared the genome variations of 8,434 people with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease from four countries (Estonia, United States, Finland and the United Kingdom) with those of 770,180 people without the disease, and identified several susceptibility genes, including an association between a gene called LPL and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. This gene, which codes for an enzyme called lipoprotein lipase, plays an important role in the storage of blood lipids in our adipose tissue. A disruption in the activity of the LPL gene could increase the chances of lipids being deposited elsewhere in the body, such as in the liver.

This genetic study also allowed us to clarify the role of distribution or localization of adipose tissue and obesity in the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. In a recent study, which is currently under peer-review, we investigated the contribution of BMI and waist circumference to the presence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. A larger waist circumference was strongly associated with having a greater risk of developing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, independent of BMI. Conversely, BMI alone had no effect on risk after considering waist circumference.

So, is it necessary to lose weight in order to prevent fatty liver disease?

Prevention or a cure?

Although some the medications used to treat Type 2 diabetes could reduce inflammation in the liver of patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, there is no specific treatment or recommended supplements for the disease at this time.

We believe that identifying the genes implicated in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease will accelerate its treatment. Until then, targeting risk factors associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease seems to be the most promising avenue. Interestingly, several studies have shown that improving nutrition and increasing physical activity levels can reduce liver fat accumulation, although these factors were associated with relatively modest weight loss.

Like other societal chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and Type 2 diabetes, fatty liver disease can be prevented to some degree. Daily activity, cooking a good variety of foods, improving sleep and limiting screen time, the consumption of ultra-processed products and exposure to stress, can prevent or delay the development of such diseases.

We believe that by democratizing access to a healthy diet and transforming urban planning to promote active travel, it will be possible to slow down the progression of such diseases in the population as a whole.","Another cardiometabolic disease that frequently flies under the radar is non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

358,358,https://news.mit.edu/2022/synthetic-datasets-ai-image-classification-0315,"When it comes to AI, can we ditch the datasets?","Huge amounts of data are needed to train machine-learning models to perform image classification tasks, such as identifying damage in satellite photos following a natural disaster. However, these data are not always easy to come by. Datasets may cost millions of dollars to generate, if usable data exist in the first place, and even the best datasets often contain biases that negatively impact a model’s performance.

To circumvent some of the problems presented by datasets, MIT researchers developed a method for training a machine learning model that, rather than using a dataset, uses a special type of machine-learning model to generate extremely realistic synthetic data that can train another model for downstream vision tasks.

Their results show that a contrastive representation learning model trained using only these synthetic data is able to learn visual representations that rival or even outperform those learned from real data.

This special machine-learning model, known as a generative model, requires far less memory to store or share than a dataset. Using synthetic data also has the potential to sidestep some concerns around privacy and usage rights that limit how some real data can be distributed. A generative model could also be edited to remove certain attributes, like race or gender, which could address some biases that exist in traditional datasets.

“We knew that this method should eventually work; we just needed to wait for these generative models to get better and better. But we were especially pleased when we showed that this method sometimes does even better than the real thing,” says Ali Jahanian, a research scientist in the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and lead author of the paper.

Jahanian wrote the paper with CSAIL grad students Xavier Puig and Yonglong Tian, and senior author Phillip Isola, an assistant professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. The research will be presented at the International Conference on Learning Representations.

Generating synthetic data

Once a generative model has been trained on real data, it can generate synthetic data that are so realistic they are nearly indistinguishable from the real thing. The training process involves showing the generative model millions of images that contain objects in a particular class (like cars or cats), and then it learns what a car or cat looks like so it can generate similar objects.

Essentially by flipping a switch, researchers can use a pretrained generative model to output a steady stream of unique, realistic images that are based on those in the model’s training dataset, Jahanian says.

But generative models are even more useful because they learn how to transform the underlying data on which they are trained, he says. If the model is trained on images of cars, it can “imagine” how a car would look in different situations — situations it did not see during training — and then output images that show the car in unique poses, colors, or sizes.

Having multiple views of the same image is important for a technique called contrastive learning, where a machine-learning model is shown many unlabeled images to learn which pairs are similar or different.

The researchers connected a pretrained generative model to a contrastive learning model in a way that allowed the two models to work together automatically. The contrastive learner could tell the generative model to produce different views of an object, and then learn to identify that object from multiple angles, Jahanian explains.

“This was like connecting two building blocks. Because the generative model can give us different views of the same thing, it can help the contrastive method to learn better representations,” he says.

Even better than the real thing

The researchers compared their method to several other image classification models that were trained using real data and found that their method performed as well, and sometimes better, than the other models.

One advantage of using a generative model is that it can, in theory, create an infinite number of samples. So, the researchers also studied how the number of samples influenced the model’s performance. They found that, in some instances, generating larger numbers of unique samples led to additional improvements.

“The cool thing about these generative models is that someone else trained them for you. You can find them in online repositories, so everyone can use them. And you don’t need to intervene in the model to get good representations,” Jahanian says.

But he cautions that there are some limitations to using generative models. In some cases, these models can reveal source data, which can pose privacy risks, and they could amplify biases in the datasets they are trained on if they aren’t properly audited.

He and his collaborators plan to address those limitations in future work. Another area they want to explore is using this technique to generate corner cases that could improve machine learning models. Corner cases often can’t be learned from real data. For instance, if researchers are training a computer vision model for a self-driving car, real data wouldn’t contain examples of a dog and his owner running down a highway, so the model would never learn what to do in this situation. Generating that corner case data synthetically could improve the performance of machine learning models in some high-stakes situations.

The researchers also want to continue improving generative models so they can compose images that are even more sophisticated, he says.

This research was supported, in part, by the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, the United States Air Force Research Laboratory, and the United States Air Force Artificial Intelligence Accelerator.","This special machine-learning model, known as a generative model, requires far less memory to store or share than a dataset.

The study of nearly 300,000 patients registered with UK general practitioners (GPs) is published today in the European Heart Journal [1].

Sodium, one of the main components of salt, is often used to help drugs such as paracetamol (also known as acetaminophen) dissolve and disintegrate in water. However, effervescent and soluble formulations of 0.5 g tablets of paracetamol can contain 0.44 and 0.39 g of sodium respectively. If a person took the maximum daily dose of two 0.5 g tablets every six hours, they would consume 3.5 and 3.1 g of sodium respectively – a dose that exceeds the total daily intake of 2 g a day recommended by the World Health Organization. Other formulations exist that contain an extremely small amount of sodium or none at all.

Too much salt in diets is known to be a major public health problem and is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and death among patients with high blood pressure. However, there is inconsistent evidence of a similar risk for people with normal blood pressure and it would be unethical to conduct a randomised controlled trial to look at this.

Researchers, led by Professor Chao Zeng from Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China, analysed data from the UK’s Health Improvement Network, which is an electronic medical database of GPs records for approximately 17 million people. They looked at 4,532 patients with high blood pressure who had been prescribed sodium-containing paracetamol and compared them with 146,866 patients with high blood pressure who had been prescribed paracetamol without sodium. They also compared 5,351 patients without high blood pressure who were prescribed sodium-containing paracetamol with 141,948 patients without high blood pressure prescribed non-sodium-containing paracetamol. The patients were aged 60-90 years and the researchers followed them up for a year.

The researchers found the risk of heart attack, stroke or heart failure after one year for patients with high blood pressure taking sodium-containing paracetamol was 5.6% (122 cases of CVD), while it was 4.6% (3051 CVD cases) among those taking non-sodium-containing paracetamol. The risk of death was also higher; the one-year risk was 7.6% (404 deaths) and 6.1% (5,510 deaths), respectively.

There was a similar increased risk among patients without high blood pressure. Among those taking sodium-containing paracetamol, the one-year CVD risk was 4.4% (105 cases of CVD) and 3.7% (2079 cases of CVD) among those taking non-sodium-containing paracetamol. The risk of dying was 7.3% (517 deaths) and 5.9% (5,190 deaths), respectively.

Prof. Zeng said: “We also found that the risk of cardiovascular disease and death increased as the duration of sodium-containing paracetamol intake increased. The risk of cardiovascular disease increased by a quarter for patients with high blood pressure who had one prescription of sodium-containing paracetamol, and it increased by nearly a half for patients who had five or more prescriptions of sodium-containing paracetamol. We saw similar increases in people without high blood pressure. The risk of death also increased with increasing doses of sodium-containing paracetamol in both patients with and without high blood pressure.”

Sodium is used widely in drug preparations for enhancing solubility and disintegration. In 2018, 170 people per 10,000 of the population in the UK were using sodium-containing medications, with a higher proportion among women.

In an editorial to accompany the research paper [2], Alta Schutte, professor of cardiac, vascular and metabolic medicine at the University of New South Wales and The George Institute for Global Health, Sydney, Australia, and Bruce Neal, executive director of The George Institute, and professor of clinical epidemiology at Imperial College London, UK, write that in the UK alone in 2014 there were 42 million paracetamol-containing medicines prescribed, with a further 200 million packs sold over the counter.

“This equates to ~6,300 tons of paracetamol sold each year in the UK, with the figure for France close to 10,000 tons. Fortunately, only a small proportion of paracetamol formulations contain sodium but, with ‘fast-acting’ and ‘fizzy’ medications increasing in popularity, the adverse effects of medication-related sodium intake look set to rise rather than fall,” they write.

Prof. Zeng said that clinicians and patients should be aware of the risks associated with paracetamol that contains sodium and avoid unnecessary consumption, especially when the medication is taken for a long period of time.

“Given that the pain relief effect of non-sodium-containing paracetamol is similar to that of sodium-containing paracetamol, clinicians may prescribe non-sodium-containing paracetamol to their patients to minimise the risk of cardiovascular disease and death. People should pay attention not only to salt intake in their food but also not overlook hidden salt intake from the medication in their cabinet,” he said.

“Although the US Food and Drug Administration requires that all over-the-counter medications should label the sodium content, no warning has been issued about the potentially detrimental effect of sodium-containing paracetamol on the risks of hypertension, cardiovascular disease and death. Our results suggest re-visiting the safety profile of effervescent and soluble paracetamol.”

Profs. Schutte and Neal call for urgent action in their editorial. “The weight of the evidence makes ongoing inaction on sodium-containing medications untenable,” they write. “The widespread use of effervescent medication in the general population, and the enormous doses of sodium that can be consumed inadvertently by unsuspecting consumers requires urgent action. Particularly concerning is the observation in some surveys that up to 94% of users of fizzy medications are self-medication using over-the-counter preparations. There is an immediate need for protection of consumers against these risks. The most plausible and effective strategy is likely to be the mandatory labelling of all medications containing significant quantities of sodium with a front-of-pack warning label . . . Information programmes that raise public and practitioner awareness of the hidden sodium in medications, and education about the need to avoid effervescent, dispersible, and soluble medicines in all but essential circumstances should also be considered.”

Strengths of the study include its large size and the fact the researchers looked at people with and without a diagnosis of high blood pressure. Limitations include the fact that this is an observational study and can show only that there is an association between salt in paracetamol and CVD and deaths, rather than that salt causes these events; there was a lack of data on dietary intake of salt and excretion of salt from urinary samples; the researchers took account of factors that could affect the results, but some may not have been accounted for, such as genetic traits; the use of over-the-counter paracetamol was not recorded, however by restricting the study to those over 60 who qualify for free prescriptions in the UK, the risk of this is minimised; patients may not have adhered to the medication prescribed by their doctors.

On 23 February 2023, the Cambodia International Health Regulations (IHR) National Focal Point (NFP) reported one confirmed case of human infection with avian influenza A (H5N1) virus to WHO. A second case, a family contact of the first case, was reported on 24 February 2023. An outbreak investigation is ongoing including determining the exposure of these two reported cases to the virus.

These are the first two cases of avian influenza A (H5N1) reported from Cambodia since 2014. In December 2003, Cambodia reported an outbreak of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) H5N1 for the first time affecting wild birds. Since then, and until 2014, human cases due to poultry-to-human transmission have been sporadically reported in Cambodia. H5N1 infection in humans can cause severe disease, has a high mortality rate, and is notifiable under IHR (2005). Description of the cases On 23 February 2023, the IHR NFP of Cambodia notified WHO of a confirmed case of human infection with avian influenza A (H5N1) virus. The case was an 11-year-old girl from Prey Veng province, in the south of Cambodia. On 16 February 2023, the case developed symptoms and received treatment at a local hospital. On 21 February 2023, the case was admitted to the National Pediatric Hospital with severe pneumonia. A sample was collected the same day through the severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) sentinel system and tested positive for avian influenza A (H5N1) virus by the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at the National Institute of Public Health on the same day. The sample was also sent to Institute Pasteur Cambodia, the National Influenza Center, which confirmed the finding. The patient died on 22 February 2023. Cambodia shared the genetic sequence data of the virus from the index case through the publicly accessible database GISAID. Virus sequencing shows the H5N1 virus belongs to clade 2.3.2.1c, and similar to the 2.3.2.1c clade viruses circulating in poultry in southeast Asia since 2014. A total of twelve close contacts (eight asymptomatic close contacts and four symptomatic who met the suspected case definition) of the index case were identified and samples were collected and tested. Laboratory investigations confirmed the second case on 23 February 2023, the father of the index child. The father, who is asymptomatic, is in isolation at the referral hospital. The eleven other samples tested negative for A (H5N1) and SARS-CoV-2. As of 25 February 2023, a total of 58 cases of human infection with avian influenza A (H5N1) virus have been reported in Cambodia since 2003, including 38 deaths (CFR 66%); nine cases and seven deaths between 2003 to 2009 and 47 cases and 30 deaths between 2010 to 2014 were reported.



Public health response

A joint animal-human health investigation is underway in the province of the index case to identify the source and mode of transmission. Additionally, a high-level government response is underway to contain any further spread of the virus.

WHO risk assessment

These are the first human infections reported in Cambodia since 2014. Human infection can cause severe disease and has a high mortality rate. Almost all Influenza A (H5N1) infection cases in people have been associated with close contact with infected live or dead birds, or Influenza A (H5N1)-contaminated environments. Based on evidence so far, the virus does not infect humans easily and spreads from person-to-person appears to be unusual. An outbreak investigation is ongoing including identifying the source of exposure of the two reported cases to the virus. Since the virus continues to be detected in poultry populations, further human cases can be expected. Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, there is a risk for sporadic infection or small clusters of human cases due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. From 2003 to 25 February 2023, a total of 873 human cases of infection with influenza A (H5N1) and 458 deaths have been reported globally from 21 countries. Public health measures from both the human and animal health agencies have been implemented including monitoring of contacts of the laboratory-confirmed cases. While further characterization of the virus from these human cases is pending, available epidemiological and virological evidence suggest that current A(H5) viruses have not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans, thus the likelihood of sustained human-to-human spread is low. Based on available information so far, WHO assesses the risk to the general population posed by this virus to be low. The risk assessment will be reviewed as needed as further epidemiological or virological information becomes available. Vaccines against avian influenza A (H5N1) for human use have been developed for pandemic use but are not widely available. WHO, through its Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) monitors the evolution of the virus, conducts risk assessment, and recommends the development of additional new candidate vaccine viruses for pandemic preparedness purposes. Close analysis of the epidemiological situation, further characterization of the most recent viruses (human and poultry) and serological investigations are critical to assess associated risk and to adjust risk management measures promptly.

WHO advice

Given reports of sporadic influenza A (H5N1) cases in humans, the widespread circulation in birds and the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect and monitor virological, epidemiological, and clinical changes associated with emerging or circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal) health and timely virus sharing for risk assessment. When avian influenza viruses are circulating in an area, people involved in high-risk tasks such as sampling sick birds, culling, and disposing of infected birds, eggs, litter and cleaning of contaminated premises should be provided with and trained in the proper use of appropriate personal protective equipment. All persons involved in these tasks should be registered and monitored closely by local health authorities for seven days following the last day of contact with infected poultry or their environments. In the case of a confirmed or suspected human infection caused by a novel influenza virus with pandemic potential, including a variant virus, a thorough epidemiologic investigation (even while awaiting the confirmatory laboratory results) of history of exposure to animals, of travel, and contact tracing should be conducted. The epidemiological investigation should include early identification of unusual respiratory events that could signal person-to-person transmission of the novel virus and clinical samples collected from the time and place that the case occurred should be tested and sent to a WHO Collaboration Centre for further characterization. Currently, there is no vaccine widely available to protect against avian influenza in humans. WHO recommends that all people involved in work with poultry or birds should have a seasonal influenza vaccination to reduce the potential risk of reassortment. Travelers to countries with known outbreaks of animal influenza should avoid farms, contact with animals in live animal markets, entering areas where animals may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with animal faeces. General precautions include regular hand washing and good food safety and food hygiene practices. Should infected individuals from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during travel or after arrival. If this were to occur, further community-level spread is considered unlikely as on the basis of available information, this virus has not acquired the ability to transmit easily among humans. WHO advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions based on the current information available on this event. WHO does not advise special traveler screening at points of entry or restrictions with regard to the current situation of influenza viruses at the human-animal interface. All human infections caused by a novel influenza subtype are notifiable under the International Health Regulations (IHR) and State Parties to the IHR (2005) are required to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory-confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by an influenza A virus with the potential to cause a pandemic. Evidence of illness is not required for this report.

364,364,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/08/judge-says-autistic-teenage-boy-with-rare-kidney-disease-can-seek-transplant,Judge says autistic teenage boy with rare kidney disease can seek transplant,"A family have spoken of their joy after a judge ruled that a teenage boy who is autistic and has learning disabilities and ADHD should be allowed a kidney transplant for a rare disease, against the judgment of doctors.

William Verden, 17, is being kept alive by dialysis at Manchester Children’s Hospital but it will stop working in 12 months at the most.

Health officials took the medical decision that William should not be offered the chance to have a kidney transplant.

That led to his family launching a legal case and an appeal for possible donors to come forward after tests showed relatives would not be suitable. William’s mother, Amy McLennan, of Lancaster, had accused the NHS of handing her son a “death sentence”.

At a court hearing in Liverpool on Tuesday, Mrs Justice Arbuthnot ruled that a transplant was in the boy’s best interests.

“Transplant is not futile,” she said. “Although the chances of that lead to an increase in William’s suffering in the short and medium term, it has the commensurate benefit which is there is a chance for William of long-term survival.”

William’s mother said going to court was not something she ever wanted. “As a family we still struggle to comprehend why William’s case has gotten to this stage but this judgment is about trying to look to the future.

“What’s happened is in the past and we now need to focus on trying to find the crucial donor who can provide William with the best chance in life.”

McLennan said all she ever wanted was for William to be added to the transplant list and have his treatment continued until a donor was found. “I feel it is the minimum he deserves and what any mum would do for their child.”

The family’s lawyer, Liz Davis, of the firm Irwin Mitchell, said it was an “incredibly sensitive case which has prompted a really important discussion not only about William’s care but also about the wider issue of providing medical treatment to people with autism and learning disabilities”.

Davis said listening to the evidence in court had been tough for the family.

“Strong legal arguments were put forward as to what is in William’s best interests. We’re pleased that the judge has ruled in William’s favour and understandably Amy and the family are overjoyed.”

William, who is autistic and has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and learning disabilities, suffers from steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome.

The court heard evidence that there was a 50% chance of success. But William’s doctors argued the chance of disease recurrence after a transplant would be nearer 100%.

The hearing was told doctors could not agree to a transplant because William would suffer psychological and physical harm from post-operation sedation and ventilation to prevent him pulling out lines and catheters.

It was also argued that if a transplant proved successful then William would live a further 15 to 20 years before he needed another one.

Toli Onon, joint group medical director for Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust said of the ruling: “We welcome the clarity which this decision brings for William, his family and our clinicians.

“The trust asked the Court of Protection to make today’s judgment because of how unusual, complex and risky the situation is.

“William has a rare condition affecting his kidneys, and each treatment option had its own risks to his health and wellbeing. That’s why we asked the court to make this difficult decision, and why the judge noted that she respected our approach to establishing what’s best for William.

“William, his family and our staff have all worked really hard together to support his dialysis; and we will now be liaising with William and his family regarding how best to progress his treatment.”

The court of protection considers cases relating to people who lack the mental capacity to make decisions.

A number of people have come forward wanting to help after the family launched an appeal for possible donors.","William Verden, 17, is being kept alive by dialysis at Manchester Children’s Hospital but it will stop working in 12 months at the most.

Globally, 322 million metric tons of plastics were produced in 2016, of which 60% supplied the food and beverage industry for food packaging. These plastics contain an array of chemicals, including stabilizers, lubricants, fillers, and plasticizers. Exposure to some environmental conditions, such as heat, causes plastic to break into smaller fragments called microplastics, which can migrate into food. Single-use water bottles, to-go containers, food cans, and storage wraps are examples of common plastic-based food packaging that contains microplastics. Heating food in plastic packaging, long storage times, and the type of plastic packaging a person uses all affect the amount of the microplastics and their harmful chemicals that migrates into food.

Common microplastics in food The microplastic chemicals present in food are a mixture of those that manufacturers deliberately add, such as fillers and stabilizers, and those that accumulate as byproducts, such as residues and impurities. Some common microplastics present in food include: bisphenol A (BPA): Manufacturers use this plasticizer to make polyvinyl chloride, the “parent” plastic of many products.

Manufacturers this plasticizer to make polyvinyl chloride, the “parent” plastic of many products. dioxin: This is a byproduct of herbicides and paper bleaching, which contaminate the environment.

This is a of herbicides and paper bleaching, which contaminate the environment. phthalates : These make plastics more flexible, transparent, and durable and are present in many types of food packaging.

These make plastics more flexible, transparent, and durable and are present in many types of food packaging. polyethylene and polypropylene: These make packaging lightweight and durable and are the most common plastics present in food and the environment. Microplastics found in smaller quantities in food include BPA and BPF, mono-(3-carboxypropyl), mono-(carboxyisononyl), and mono-(carboxyisoctyl).

How much exposure do we experience? Microplastics are abundant in the environment, an outcome scientists attribute to the massive global production of plastics and widespread pollution. Research suggests that an average person in the United States may consume over 50,000 particles of microplastics from food alone per year. This figure increases to an estimated 90,000 in those who regularly consume plastic-based bottled water, and to 120,000 when considering the inhalation of microplastics from non-food sources. The authors of a 2019 study identified an average of 20 microplastics per 10 grams of stool samples from eight participants. These findings suggest that the amount of microplastics that people come into contact with and consume is much greater than experts once anticipated.

How to minimize exposure While eliminating your exposure to microplastics may not be possible, you can try to reduce the amount of microplastics you come into contact with and consume. Here are some tips: 1. Limit highly processed foods Research associates consumption of highly processed foods — such as hamburgers, ready-to-eat convenience meals, French fries, ice cream, soda, and canned foods — with higher levels of phthalate microplastics in the body. This effect is more pronounced in children. Experts further speculate that the low nutritional quality of highly processed foods, combined with the harmful effects of the microplastics present in those foods, may be responsible for the development of chronic conditions, including heart disease. The solution: Choose whole foods and minimally processed foods more often and limit or eliminate highly processed foods from your diet. This will help lower levels of endocrine-disrupting microplastics in the body. 2. Choose eco-friendly packaging Using eco-friendly packaging reduces the exposure to and migration of microplastics in the food supply. The solution: Opt for the following: glass storage containers, portable bowls, and water bottles

stainless steel bento boxes and reusable water containers

bamboo lunch boxes, bowls, utensils, and pantry storage jars

rice husk bowls and storage containers 3. Use glass or stainless steel water bottles Exposure to microplastics is almost 2–3 times higher in individuals who rely on their fluid intake from plastic water bottles than in those who use alternative water bottles. This may be due to the fact that heat and longer storage times that may be common with bottled water increase the migration of microplastics from packaging into the food and water. The solution: Replace single-use or BPA-containing water bottles with glass or stainless steel ones to reduce exposure to microplastics.","Globally, 322 million metric tons of plastics were produced in 2016, of which 60% supplied the food and beverage industry for food packaging.

Workers at airports, ports, railways, buses and metro lines throughout much of Europe's top economy are expected to heed a call by the Verdi and EVG unions to the 24-hour walkout.

""A labour struggle that has no impact is toothless,"" Verdi chief Frank Werneke told public broadcaster Phoenix.

He acknowledged that it would inflict pain on many commuters and holidaymakers, ""but better one day of strain with the prospect of reaching a wage agreement than weeks of industrial action"".

To prevent supply gaps, Transport Minister Volker Wissing has ordered states to lift restrictions on truck deliveries Sunday, while asking airports to allow late-night takeoffs and landings ""so stranded passengers can reach their destinations"".

Verdi represents about 2.5 million public sector employees, while EVG represents 230,000 workers on the railways and at bus companies.

The rare joint call for a strike in Germany marks an escalation of an increasingly ill-tempered dispute over a pay packet to blunt the impact of surging inflation.

Employers, mostly the state and public sector companies, have so far refused the demands, instead offering a rise of 5 per cent with two one-off payments of €1,000 (US$1,100) and €1,500, this year and next.

Verdi is demanding a rise of 10.5 per cent in monthly salaries, while EVG is seeking a 12 per cent rise for those it represents.

""MASSIVE IMPACT""

State-owned rail company Deutsche Bahn (DB) has completely suspended all long-distance trains for the day and many regional and local connections will be at a standstill.

DB's Martin Seiler, responsible for human resources on the company's management board, described the nationwide strike as ""groundless and unnecessary"" and urged the unions to return to the negotiating table ""immediately"".

The company expects the walkout to have a ""massive impact"" on its entire rail network and has pledged to inform its customers ""as quickly and comprehensively as possible"" about cancellations and delays.

The German airport association, which estimated about 380,000 air travellers would be affected, said the walkout ""went beyond any imaginable and justifiable measure"".

Employers have accused labour representatives of contributing to a wage-price spiral that will only feed inflation, while unions say their members have been asked to bear the burden of the soaring cost of living.

""Petrol and food prices have risen, I'm feeling it in my wallet,"" Timo Stau, 21, told AFP at a protest on Thursday in Berlin.

""ECONOMIC HARDSHIP""

Like in many other countries, Germans are struggling with high inflation - it hit 8.7 per cent in February - after Russia's invasion of Ukraine sent food and energy costs soaring.

The ""mega-strike"", as local media have dubbed it, follows industrial action in recent months in several German sectors, from the postal service to airports and local transport.

A third round of salary negotiations for public-sector workers is due to begin on Monday.

Earlier in March, Bremen, Berlin, Hamburg and Hanover airports cancelled more than 350 flights after security staff walked out. Bus and metro staff in Frankfurt also staged a strike.

Some unions however have succeeded in winning big pay increases.

Postal workers won average monthly increases of 11.5 per cent earlier in March, and in November IG Metall, Germany's biggest union, won hikes totalling 8.5 per cent for almost four million employees that it represents.

Although Monday's walkout is set to create travel chaos, it pales in comparison to the industrial disputes rocking neighbouring France, where President Emmanuel Macron's pension reform plans have ignited voter anger.

Rubbish is gathering in the streets of Paris due to a rolling strike by garbage collectors, while blockades of oil refineries by striking workers are beginning to create fuel shortages around the country.","BERLIN: Transport staff across Germany are set to stage a major strike on Monday (Mar 27) to push for wage hikes in the face of brisk inflation, as passengers brace for serious disruptions.

At the time, some 300,000 people were injured, and 1.5 million became homeless during the 35-second-long tremor.

Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary General in Haiti, Bruno Lemarquis, took part in a remembrance ceremony on Wednesday, to remember the lives lost.

António Guterres, UN Secretary-General antonioguterres

The UN system in Haiti honoured those staffers who perished, in a statement released on Wednesday, describing it as “one of the darkest days in its history”.

Since then, “Haiti has drawn on the resilience of its people, the work of its institutions and the assistance of its many friends and supporters to overcome the ravages caused by that calamity”.

Across the UN system, messages of remembrance were shared. UN Secretary-General, António Guterres, said on a tweet that “everyday we remember the victims and honour their legacy through the Organization’s work”. And the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), renewed its support for Haiti’s “path to recovery, stability and prosperity”.

Last August, another large earthquake hit the southern regions of the country, killing more than 2,200 and injuring over 12,000 people, and leaving thousands of homes destroyed.

The same sense of resilience and solidarity was again in evidence, as Haitians promptly and effectively responded to yet another disaster.

Sustainable future

In the statement issued by the UN office, the Organization renewed its commitment to work alongside the Haitian people, and with the country’s friends and supporters.

The UN is on the ground, continuing to work on long-term reconstruction, helping communities “to build a sustainable, inclusive, and brighter future for Haiti.”","At the time, some 300,000 people were injured, and 1.5 million became homeless during the 35-second-long tremor.

In Leipzig, one of the two shifts will be cancelled. In Regensburg, production will also be limited to a single shift.

BMW's plants in the U.S., China and Mexico are not impacted because they have different suppliers, a BMW spokesman told the Sueddeutsche newspaper.

The stoppages mean that almost the entire European production of the automaker is being impacted by the Ukraine crisis.

Crisis team

BMW has set up a crisis team, similar to those established by other automakers including Volkwagen and Stellantis that have been hit by the supply disruption.

Specialist departments are in intensive talks with suppliers to secure supplies via alternative production sites and to restart production as quickly as possible, the BMW spokesman told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.

The stoppages are being caused after deliveries of wire harnesses that BMW sources from western Ukraine were disrupted. The harnesses are a key part of a vehicle's electrical systems.

German cable maker Leoni, with two plants in Ukraine employing some 7,000 workers, said it is intensifying efforts to help offset the disruption in Ukraine by adding capacity at other sites, while prioritizing the safety of its employees.

“Logistics in and out of Ukraine are a particular challenge, especially because of the partly chaotic situation at the border points with the EU,” a Leoni spokesman said in a statement.

German automotive companies and suppliers maintain some 49 production sites in Russia and Ukraine, according to the German car lobby group VDA.

Export stop

BMW also said it had halted the export of cars to Russia and would stop production in the country.

Last year, BMW assembled about 12,000 vehicles at a factory in the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad that BMW has operated with local partner Avtotor for more than 20 years.

Sales of BMW brand vehicles in Russia rose 10 percent to 46,802 last year, according to the Moscow-based AEB industry association.

374,374,https://www.health.com/condition/infectious-diseases/coronavirus/covid-19-cardiovascular-disease-risk,COVID-19 Can Increase Risk of Cardiovascular Disease Up to a Year Later—Even After Mild Illness,"Even after recovering from a milder case of COVID-19, people can still face significantly higher risks for new heart problems up to a year after diagnosis, according to new research. Cardiovascular issues—including heart failure, stroke, and myocarditis—affected people regardless of age or the presence of risk factors.

The study, published in the journal Nature Medicine, is the first comprehensive look at the cardiovascular outcomes that can occur following a COVID-19 diagnosis, regardless of severity.

""Until now we had data that COVID infection could affect the heart in the short term,"" Saurabh Rajpal, MBBS, a cardiologist and assistant professor in the Division of Cardiology at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, tells Health. Dr. Raipal, who was unaffiliated with the new research points to issues like heart inflammation or blood clots in the acute stage of the disease. ""However, this research shows that COVID can have lingering effects on the heart,"" he says.

And the effects of COVID-19 on long-term heart health aren't insignificant. ""Consequently, COVID-19 infections have, thus far, contributed to 15 million new cases of heart disease worldwide,"" Ziyad Al-Aly, MD, one of the study's co-authors, and chief of research and development service at the VA Saint Louis Health Care System said in a press release. ""This is quite significant. For anyone who has had an infection, it is essential that heart health be an integral part of post-acute COVID care.""

How COVID-19 Affects Long-Term Heart Health

To investigate the potential long-term cardiovascular effects of having COVID-19, researchers looked at data from national health care databases curated by the US Department of Veteran Affairs (VA). The information was split into three separate groups: people who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 (153,760 individuals), people who did not catch the virus (5,637,647 individuals), and people whose data was collected pre-pandemic (5,859,411 individuals).

Across the board, COVID-19 survivors were at an increased risk for cardiovascular diseases across several categories, including cerebral vascular disorders, dysrhythmia, inflammatory heart disease, ischemic heart disease, thrombotic disorders, and other cardiac disorders. More specifically, being diagnosed with COVID-19 increased a person's risk of heart attack by 63%, stroke by 52%, and heart failure by 72% in a 12-month period, compared to those without the illness.

The findings did not discriminate against age, race, gender, or pre-existing conditions—according to study authors, even people without a history of cardiovascular disease before a COVID-19 diagnosis were at a higher risk after having the illness. Researchers also found that people were affected despite the severity of their COVID-19 infection, and cardiovascular risks were evident even in people who weren't hospitalized during the acute phase of their illness, which reflects the majority of people who have COVID-19.

Still, researchers say the study has its limitations: In using data from the VA—which was from mainly white men—the demographics of the study weren't necessarily representative of the US population. It's also possible that those who were part of the control group actually had COVID-19 but didn't know or weren't officially diagnosed with the illness, which could throw off results. And as the COVID-19 pandemic continues, new variants and greater vaccine adherence could lead to a change in these cardiovascular issues.

What To Know if You've Had COVID-19

Scientists are still learning about the long-term effects of COVID-19 in real-time, but this new research suggests that a history of COVID-19 infection should be considered as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. According to Dr. Al-Aly, physicians should evaluate patients with that in mind. It is worth a conversation with your primary care doctor if you have been infected with COVID-19.

""It is essential to inform your doctor of a prior COVID-19 infection so that he/she can be alerted to the late effects that the virus may have caused,"" Andrea Mignatti, MD, an interventional cardiologist at Lenox Hill Hospital, who is not affiliated with the study, tells Health. ""While COVID-19 is a disease that predominantly affects the lungs, it can also affect other organs, including the heart, kidneys, the nervous system, and blood cells.""

""There is no universal consensus around [monitoring the heart after COVID-19],"" adds Dr. Al-Aly. ""Our understanding of the long-term health consequences of COVID-19 is evolving. What is clear is that people can get heart problems after COVID-19 infection even if they had no heart problems whatsoever before the infection, and even if they had no cardiovascular risk factors.""

The good news is that there is a very easy way to reduce the risk of COVID-19-related heart problems, and that is to protect yourself from COVID-19 altogether with the vaccine. ""The risk of developing heart problems including myocarditis, arrhythmias, blood clots—both in legs and lungs—heart attacks, bleeding, is significantly higher in patients who did not receive the vaccine, compared to the ones who are vaccinated,"" says Dr. Mignatti.

Though it's unclear how helpful vaccines and boosters are in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease as a result of breakthrough infections—because, as Dr. Al-Aly notes, ""vaccines are not 100% effective""—they're still considered the best option to protect against severe COVID-19 and hospitalization or death from the disease.

Why COVID-19 Remains a Greater Risk Factor for Myocarditis Than Vaccines

It'd be remiss not to mention the real (although very rare) risk of heart inflammation as a result from COVID-19 vaccination with an mRNA vaccine like Pfizer-BioNtech or Moderna. The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) in June 2021 declared a ""likely association"" between COVID-19 mRNA vaccines and myocarditis and pericarditis—two rare forms of heart inflammation.

Data from the ACIP meeting shows that the cases of myocarditis and pericarditis occur most often within a week of the second dose of an mRNA vaccine, and typically in younger males, ages 16–24.

But the risks of myocarditis or pericarditis after COVID-19 vaccination overall are much lower than the risks of heart inflammation following a bout with COVID-19 itself. A recent study published in the journal Nature Medicine compared the risk of cardiac events between vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 infection and found that, though there is a slight increased risk of myocarditis within a week of receiving a second dose of an mRNA vaccine, having COVID-19 ""substantially increased"" the risk of multiple cardiac events (myocarditis, pericarditis, and cardiac arrhythmia).

What's more: While myocarditis can be life-threatening, vaccine-associated myocarditis was mostly ""mild and self-limiting,"" according to researchers. Cardiac events from SARS-CoV-2 infection, however, put patients at a greater risk of hospitalization or death from their condition.

Though not without risks, COVID-19 vaccines can better protect people against cardiovascular issues. ""The risk of myocarditis after COVID-19 is much higher than the risk of myocarditis after vaccines,"" says Dr. Al-Aly. ""Vaccines are the safer choice.""

The information in this story is accurate as of press time. However, as the situation surrounding COVID-19 continues to evolve, it's possible that some data have changed since publication. While Health is trying to keep our stories as up-to-date as possible, we also encourage readers to stay informed on news and recommendations for their own communities by using the CDC, WHO, and their local public health department as resources.","And the effects of COVID-19 on long-term heart health aren't insignificant.

The World Health Organization has provided an update on the Marburg virus disease first detected in Equatorial Guinea last February. There have been nine laboratory-confirmed and 20 probable cases so far, as well as 27 deaths.

MVD is a highly virulent disease that causes hemorrhagic fever, and is among the viral hemorrhagic fevers that require assessment under the International Health Regulations.

The WHO wrote, “Since the first Disease Outbreak News on this event was published on 25 February 2023, eight additional laboratory-confirmed cases of Marburg virus disease (MVD) have been reported in Equatorial Guinea. This brings the total to nine laboratory-confirmed cases and 20 probable cases since the declaration of the outbreak in February 2023. There are seven deaths among the laboratory confirmed, and all probable cases are dead. Of the eight new confirmed cases, two were reported from the province of Kié-Ntem, four from the Litoral, and two from Centre- Sur provinces. The areas reporting cases are about 150 kilometers apart, suggesting wider transmission of the virus.”

WHO said that it has deployed experts to support national response efforts and strengthen community engagement in the response, and assesses the risk posed by the outbreak as very high at the national level, moderate at the regional level, and low at the global level.

Description of the situation, according to the WHO

On 7 February 2023, the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare of Equatorial Guinea reported at least eight suspected MVD deaths that occurred between 7 January and 7 February 2023, in two villages located in the district of Nsok Nsomo, in the eastern province of Kié-Ntem, Río Muni Region.

On 12 February 2023, eight blood samples were collected from contacts and sent to the Institute Pasteur in Dakar, Senegal, where one of these samples was confirmed positive for Marburg virus by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). This case presented with fever, vomiting, blood-stained diarrhoea, convulsions, and died on 10 February 2023 in a hospital. The case also had epidemiological links to four deceased suspected cases from one of the villages in Nsok-Nsomo district.

On 13 March 2023, samples from two additional individuals from Kié-Ntem province tested positive for MVD by RT-PCR performed at a mobile laboratory at the Regional Hospital of Ebibeyin. Another sample, obtained from a resident of Litoral province in the western part of the country, epidemiologically linked to a confirmed case in Kié-Ntem, tested positive for MVD on 15 March 2023 following RT-PCR performed by the same laboratory. The two provinces (Kié-Ntem and Litoral) are located in different parts of the country, about 150 kilometers apart. On 18 and 20 March three additional laboratory confirmed positive cases were reported from Litoral province. On 20 March two more laboratory confirmed cases were reported from Centre Sur province. The wide geographic distribution of cases and uncertain epidemiological links in Centre Sur province suggests the potential for undetected community spread of the virus.

Overall, since the beginning of the outbreak and as of 21 March, a cumulative number of nine confirmed and 20 probable cases have been recorded in Equatorial Guinea.

Epidemiology of Marburg virus disease, according to the WHO

Marburg virus and the closely related Ravn virus are the causative agents of Marburg virus disease, which has a case-fatality ratio of up to 88%. Marburg virus disease was initially detected in 1967 after simultaneous outbreaks in Marburg and Frankfurt in Germany, and in Belgrade, Serbia. Rousettus aegyptiacus fruit bats are considered natural hosts for Marburg virus, from which the virus is then transmitted to people.

Marburg spreads between people via direct contact through broken skin or mucous membranes with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people, and with surfaces and materials such as bedding, clothing contaminated with these fluids. Healthcare workers have previously been infected while treating patients with suspected or confirmed MVD. Burial ceremonies that involve direct contact with the body of the deceased can also contribute to the transmission of Marburg.

The incubation period varies from two to 21 days. Illness caused by Marburg virus begins abruptly, with high fever, severe headache, and severe malaise. Severe watery diarrhoea, abdominal pain and cramping, nausea, and vomiting can begin on the third day. Severe haemorrhagic manifestations may appear between five and seven days from symptom onset, and fatal cases usually have some form of bleeding, often from multiple areas. In fatal cases, death occurs most often between eight and nine days after symptom onset, usually preceded by severe blood loss and shock.

In the early course of the disease, the clinical diagnosis of MVD is difficult to distinguish from many other tropical febrile illnesses due to the similarities in the clinical symptoms. Other viral haemorrhagic fevers need to be excluded, including Ebola virus disease, as well as malaria, typhoid fever, leptospirosis, rickettsial infections, and plague.

Laboratory confirmation is primarily made by RT-PCR. Other tests can be used such as antibody-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), antigen-capture detection tests, serum neutralization test, electron microscopy, and virus isolation by cell culture.

Although no vaccines or antiviral treatments are approved to treat the virus, supportive care – rehydration with oral or intravenous fluids – and treatment of specific symptoms improve survival. A range of potential treatments are being evaluated, including blood products, immune therapies, and drug therapies.

This is the first time that Equatorial Guinea has reported an outbreak of MVD. The most recently reported outbreak of MVD was in Ghana in 2022 (where there were three confirmed cases). Other MVD outbreaks have been previously reported in Guinea (2021), Uganda (2017, 2014, 2012, 2007), Angola (2004-2005), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (1998 and 2000), Kenya (1990, 1987, 1980) and South Africa (1975).

Public health response, according to the WHO

In-depth epidemiological investigations are ongoing to determine the source of the outbreak.

National teams have been deployed to the affected districts for active case finding, contact tracing, and clinical management of suspected cases.

WHO has deployed experts in epidemiology, case management, infection prevention and control (IPC), laboratory, and risk communication to support national response efforts and ensure community engagement.

WHO has shipped materials for sample collection and analysis, and viral haemorrhagic fever kits including personal protective equipment for 500 health workers.

WHO is supporting the training of national responders in surveillance, case management, IPC, safe and dignified burial (SDB), and risk communication and community engagement (RCCE).

The Government has activated the public health emergency operation center (PHEOC) at Ebibeyin and now in Bata under the leadership of the Minister of Health and the District Chief Medical Officer.

WHO is supporting ongoing community engagement activities to create awareness, share prevention information, and encourage reporting of alerts.

Alert systems have been established with the availability of a hotline.

WHO risk assessment

Equatorial Guinea is facing an outbreak of MVD for the first time while the country’s capacity to manage the outbreak needs to be strengthened.

In addition to the one confirmed case reported in the Disease Outbreak News of 25 February, eight more individuals have tested positive for MVD, indicating that exposure to the virus may be more widespread.

All three affected provinces have international borders with Cameroon and Gabon. Cross-border population movements are frequent, and the borders are very porous. Although no MVD cases have been reported outside Equatorial Guinea the risk of international spread cannot be ruled out.

Considering the above-described situation, and based on newly available information since the last update, the geographical spread of the outbreak in Equatorial Guinea and the uncertain epidemiological links for some of the confirmed cases, the risk assessment is currently being reviewed, however, it is considered very high at the national level, high at sub-regional level, moderate at the regional level and low at the global level.

WHO advice

Marburg virus disease outbreak control relies on using a range of interventions, such as prompt isolation and case management; surveillance including active case search, case investigation and contact tracing; an optimal laboratory service; infection prevention and control, including prompt safe and dignified burial; and social mobilization – community engagement is key to successfully controlling MVD outbreaks. Raising awareness of risk factors for Marburg infection and protective measures that individuals can take is an effective way to reduce human transmission.

Healthcare workers caring for patients with confirmed or suspected MVD should apply additional IPC measures beyond standard precautions to avoid contact with patients’ blood and body fluids and with contaminated surfaces and objects.

WHO recommends that male survivors of MVD practice safer sex and hygiene for 12 months from onset of symptoms, or until their semen twice tests negative for the Marburg virus. Contact with body fluids should be avoided and washing with soap and water is recommended. WHO does not recommend isolation of male or female convalescent patients whose blood has tested negative for the Marburg virus.

Based on the available information and current risk assessment, WHO advises against any travel and trade restrictions in Equatorial Guinea.","The World Health Organization has provided an update on the Marburg virus disease first detected in Equatorial Guinea last February.

It joins a large body of research supporting nuts as part of a heart-healthy diet.

Experts say nuts shouldn’t be the only way you combat your heart disease risk.

New research has found that adding a small amount of nuts to your diet can help support good heart health.

The study, which was published in the journal Food Nutrition Research, analyzed data from 42 scientific papers that included 1.8 million people and found that eating a handful of nuts daily can lower the risk of heart disease by about 25%. The researchers also found that, while nuts lowered the amount of fat in the blood, they didn’t seem to impact blood pressure or blood sugar.

This isn’t the first study to tie nuts to a lowered risk of heart disease. A study of nearly 193,000 people published in the Journal of the American Heart Association in 2020 found that people who ate nuts on a regular basis had a lower risk of developing cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease, and stroke compare to those who didn’t eat nuts. “These data support the role of nut intake in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease,” the researchers wrote.

Research from some of the largest cohort studies, including the Adventist Study, the Iowa Women’s Health Study, the Nurses’ Health Study, and the Physicians’ Health Study have also consistently shown that people who eat nuts several times a week have a 30 to 50% lower risk of cardiovascular disease or sudden cardiac death than those who don’t.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has even allowed some nuts, including macadamia nuts and pecans, to carry a label that suggests they can support good heart health.

But why might nuts be helpful for good heart health, and how can you add them to your diet? Here’s what you need to know.

Why might eating nuts help your heart?

Heart disease is a complicated illness and it’s difficult to pin your risk on developing it just on nuts, says lead study author Erik Arnesen, a researcher at the University of Oslo. Still, he says, nuts may be able to help support good heart health.

“It is true that heart disease has several risk factors, but almost all of them—about 90 %—are so-called ‘modifiable’ factors, meaning that the potential for prevention is huge,” he says. “Of biological risk factors, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels are the main causes for myocardial infarction, and we know that these to a large extent are related to diet and lifestyle.”

Nuts have several nutrients that can be helpful for heart health including unsaturated fatty acids that are linked to lower levels of cholesterol in the blood, Arnesen says. “Adding nuts to the diet has been shown in clinical trials to lower cholesterol, and this may explain at least partly why people who regularly eat nuts have a lower risk,” he says.

Overall dietary habits matter, too, when it comes to heart disease risk, Arnesen says. “It is best to include nuts in the diet as a replacement for less healthy and less nutrient-dense foods and snacks,” he says. “If you only add nuts on top of a diet with a lot of junk food and sweets, you will likely not get any healthier.”

Holly S. Andersen, M.D., attending cardiologist and associate professor of clinical medicine at the New York-Presbyterian Hospital, Weill Cornell Medical Center, says she’s “not surprised” by the latest findings. “Study after study has shown that eating a variety of nuts is good for your heart,” she says. “Nuts have a favorable unsaturated to saturated fat ratio and contain fiber, folic acid, magnesium, phytosterols, and tocopherols—all felt to be cardio-protective.”

Nuts also have a good amount of fiber, points out Rigved Tadwalkar, M.D., a board certified cardiologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, Calif. “That can improve blood sugar control and promote healthy digestion,” he says. “","New research finds that eating nuts regularly may lower your risk of heart disease.

Mr Yang and his wife started their own cooking oil business 10 years later, and called it Din Tai Fung. But in the early 1970s, sales took a big hit after tinned cooking oil became widely available.

After a day of deliberation, U.S. District Court Judge Lisa Godbey Wood said Tuesday morning that the jury — made up of eight white people, three Black people and one Hispanic person — had come to a conclusion and would read its verdict shortly.

The jury found father and son Greg and Travis McMichael and their neighbor William ""Roddie"" Bryan guilty of all the federal charges they individually faced, including hate crimes, attempted kidnapping and the use of a firearm to commit a crime. The conviction came one day before the second anniversary of Arbery's murder.

The McMichaels and Bryan chased Arbery, 25, through their coastal Georgia neighborhood in trucks. The three men, who spotted Arbery running by their homes in February 2020, cornered him and Travis McMichael fatally shot him with a shotgun.

The McMichaels and Bryan were free for several weeks after the shooting. They were arrested only after the video that Bryan recorded was released and the case was taken over by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.

They were convicted of murder and given life sentences in the state trial. The federal hate crimes trial centered on the history of the three men and their racial bias, a motive that prosecutors in the state case largely avoided, even though Arbery's killing gained national attention at the same time that the United States reckoned with issues including racism and bias in policing.

“Two years ago today, none of us knew of Ahmaud Arbery. But two years ago tomorrow, his story shook the conscience of our nation and world,” NAACP President Derrick Johnson said. “Ahmaud Arbery was lynched in broad daylight, and today’s verdict brings us one step closer to justice.”

The hate crimes verdict is an emotional victory for Arbery’s family members, who spoke out against a proposed plea deal for the men.

The McMichaels attempted to plead guilty to the hate crime charges prior to the trial, but the plea agreement was rejected by the judge after Arbery’s parents, Wanda Cooper-Jones and Marcus Arbery, protested that the men would be able serve their time in a federal prison instead of a state one, calling the deal “disrespectful.”

After the trial, Cooper-Jones said she was thankful for the prosecution, but she also noted that the Department of Justice ""did not hear my cry"" as it continued to push forward with a plea deal that she did not support.

“What we got today, we wouldn’t have got today if it wasn’t for the fight that the family put up,"" she said. ""What the DOJ did today, they was made to do today.”

Attorney General Merrick Garland grew emotional during a Department of Justice press briefing on Tuesday that addressed the case when members of the press asked him to respond to Cooper-Jones’ statement.

“I cannot imagine the pain that a mother feels to have her son run down and then gunned down, while taking a jog on a public street,” Garland said, his voice trembling. “My heart goes out to her and to the family. That’s really all I can say about this.”

Earlier in the press briefing, Garland said no one in the U.S. ""should fear being attacked or threatened"" because of their race, religion, sexuality or ethnicity and promised that the Department of Justice would punish crimes driven by intolerance.

""The Justice Department has a legal obligation to prosecute hate crimes, and, as Americans, all of us have a moral obligation to combat the hatred and bigotry that motivates those crimes,"" the attorney general said. ""Today’s verdict makes clear that the Justice Department will continue to use every resource at its disposal to confront unlawful acts of hate and to hold accountable those who perpetrate them.""

Federal prosecutors spent a week working to establish that Arbery's murder was driven by the three men's racial bias and their animus toward Black people.

Witnesses called included an FBI analyst who had combed through the three men's social media and messaging history, where she found messages, videos and memes that appeared to show that the three men held strong prejudices against Black people.

The defense said the messages and social media posts were taken out of context.

Friday was the final day of testimony and perhaps the most jarring for the jury, as prosecutors called neighbors and former co-workers of the McMichaels, who all testified that the father and son made troubling racist jokes, rants and statements and were open about their negative feelings toward Black people.

Throughout the case, the defense maintained that the three men may not be likable, may have said troubling things and did not dispute the essential facts of the case. But they insisted that they were not driven by prejudice to chase and kill Arbery.

On Monday, the jury heard closing arguments in which prosecutor Christopher Perras said that the three men were driven by their ""pent-up racial anger"" and that Travis McMichael ""was just looking for a reason"" to harm a Black person.

The prosecution also focused on the McMichaels operating as vigilantes and their view that they were above the law. At one point in the closing statement, Perras noted that Greg McMichael did not call police when Arbery ran by; he called his son and picked up his gun.

“There’s a big difference between being vigilant and being a vigilante,” Perras said.","The three white men convicted of murdering Ahmaud Arbery, a young Black man, were found guilty of hate crimes and other charges by a federal jury in Georgia on Tuesday.

According to the boy's death certificate, the cause of death is cardiorespiratory failure, said Shin Min Daily News.

The Chinese-language newspaper reported on Monday (Jan 3) that the boy, Yong Jing Yu, had apparently stopped breathing before he was admitted to Sengkang General Hospital.

In response to queries from The Straits Times, the police said they were alerted to a case of unnatural death at Block 158D Rivervale Crescent at 6.25pm on Dec 28.

A baby was taken to hospital unconscious and subsequently pronounced dead at the hospital. Investigations are ongoing, the police added.

As health care professionals, researchers and consumers increasingly use genetic testing, they are uncovering incidental genetic abnormalities, or variants, that are associated with cardiovascular diseases.

The statement writing committee cautions that incidentally identified single gene variants may or may not be risk factors for disease, so it is important to interpret them correctly and cautiously.

The new scientific statement offers a framework to support health care professionals in appropriately assessing individual genetic variants, communicating findings with patients and families, and, when needed, how to create a strong multidisciplinary team for individualized care.

Embargoed until 4 a.m. CT / 5 a.m. ET Monday, March 27, 2023

DALLAS, March 27, 2023 — Increasing use of genetic testing means people may discover they have a gene variant associated with some types of cardiovascular disease (CVD). A new scientific statement, published today in the American Heart Association journal Circulation: Genomic and Precision Medicine, aims to help individuals and health care professionals understand what to do when a variant is discovered.

An American Heart Association scientific statement is an expert analysis of current research and may inform future guidelines. The new statement, “Interpreting Incidentally Identified Variants in Genes Associated with Heritable Cardiovascular Disease,” suggests next steps to determine whether a variant truly carries a health risk, provides support to health care professionals on how to communicate with people and their families, and suggests appropriate follow-up actions to care for people with variants deemed higher risk for CVD.

Variants associated with cardiovascular disease risk are often found “incidentally” when people undergo genetic testing for non-cardiac reasons, including screening or diagnosis of other diseases. These unexpected genetic variants may also be discovered with genetic testing through direct-to-consumer DNA testing kits.

Pretest genetic counseling is strongly encouraged to prepare patients for the possibility of incidental findings, how and whether findings will be communicated, and potential implications for themselves and family members.

“The scope and use of genetic testing have expanded greatly in the past decade with the increasing ease and reduced cost of DNA sequencing,” said Andrew P. Landstrom, M.D., Ph.D., FAHA, chair of the scientific statement writing committee and associate professor of pediatrics and cell biology at Duke University School of Medicine in Durham, North Carolina. “Where we would once look for genetic changes in a handful of genes, we can now sequence every gene and, potentially, the whole genome, allowing us to make genetic diagnoses that would have been impossible in the past. However, with increased genetic testing comes more surprises, including finding unexpected variants in genes that might be associated with cardiovascular disease.

“If we interpret these incidental variants incorrectly, it may lead to inappropriate care, either by suggesting patients have a risk of cardiac disease when they do not, or by not providing care to those with increased risk for a serious condition.”

This statement is the first to focus on inherited monogenic, or single-gene, diseases for CVD which can be passed on within families, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or long QT syndrome. There are currently 42 clinically treatable, secondary variant genes that increase the risk of sickness or death from sudden cardiac death, heart failure and other types of cardiovascular disease, according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics. Genetic variants that cause long QT syndrome cause the heart to electrically reset slower than normal after each contraction, which may cause electrical instability of the heart and may lead to fainting, arrhythmias or even sudden death.

Once an incidental genetic variant for CVD is found, the statement authors suggest a framework for interpreting the variant and determining whether it is classified as benign, uncertain or pathogenic (disease-causing):

Health care professionals should only relay information to patients about incidentally identified variants if they are among the cardiovascular disease genes already known to be associated with CVD and if patients agreed during pretest genetic counseling to be informed about incidental findings.

Incidentally identified variants in genes with an uncertain association with CVD should not be reported.

If the discovered variant may increase the risk of CVD, a family history and medical evaluation by an expert health care professional are suggested, preferably a specialist working with or within a multidisciplinary team to address in the disease in question. The goal of this evaluation is to determine whether the individual has evidence of the disease, such as symptoms or relevant test results, or if there are any warning signs in the family history.

The genetic variant itself should be re-evaluated periodically by an expert or expert team to ensure whether the CVD link remains accurate. As knowledge about a variant evolves over time, its link to disease may be reclassified.

Finally, the medical evaluation and genetic re-evaluation should guide next steps, which may vary from dismissing the incidental variant as not likely to cause CVD to starting medical interventions. This may also involve periodic re-evaluation with appropriate tests (echocardiogram, blood tests, etc.) and possibly screening other family members for the variant.

“The list of incidental variants related to cardiovascular disease continues to evolve. This statement provides a foundation of care that may help people with a CVD-related genetic variant and their health care professionals take the next step in determining the individual and familial risk that a variant may or may not carry,” Landstrom said. “It’s also important to consult with genetics specialists to custom-tailor an evaluation and treatment plan to both the individual and the genetic variant in order to ensure the highest level of care possible.”

(WHDH) - An investigation is underway into a series of Legionnaires’ disease cases in New Hampshire, health officials announced on Tuesday.

Officials with the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services said five people contracted Legionella pneumonia between early fall 2021 and January of this year. In each case, officials said individuals stayed at the Meredith Woods and Clearwater Campground in Meredith, N.H. before falling ill.

Officials said each of the five individuals had to be hospitalized, though they have since recovered.

State Epidemiologist Dr. Benjamin Chan discussed efforts to date and next steps on Wednesday.

“We’re working with the facility and the owners of the Meredith Woods facility to implement a water management plan, mitigate the risk and make sure future infections don’t occur and future exposure doesn’t occur,” Chan told 7NEWS.

As part of their investigation, officials asked anyone who was diagnosed with Legionnaires’ disease after visiting Meredith Woods and Clearwater Campground to contact the Division of Public Health Services.

Chan also said anyone who recently stayed at the campground who develops symptoms including pneumonia or fever and respiratory symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath, headache and muscles aches, should talk to their healthcare provider about testing for Legionella infection.

Most people exposed to the Legionella bacteria do not get sick, as noted in the Department of Health and Human Services’ statement this week. Those who do get sick, though, can suffer severe illness and death in some cases.

Officials said Legionnaires’ disease is usually not transmitted between people. Instead, officials said most people become infected by inhaling Legionella bacteria from water droplets.

He highlighted two serious problems: the deluge of wilful misinformation, and growth of scams, fraud and cybercrime.

On the spread of misinformation, Mr Daniel said an episode during the United States presidential election in 2016 illustrates the difficulties of reining in the problem.

A piece of fake news tweeted by a woman at that time had falsely accused Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton of running a child sex ring in Washington. It brought a man from North Carolina to the US capital, where he fired three shots in a so-called bid to rescue the allegedly kidnapped children.

But while the 29-year-old man was arrested, charged and jailed for four years, no action was taken against the 60-year-old woman who posted the fake news.

Citing this, Mr Daniel said: ""No matter how false the information, no matter what damage it causes... her freedom of expression was sacrosanct. Like it or not, that is the law in the US.""

At the same time, Section 230 of the US Communications Decency Act 1996 gives social media giants blanket immunity with respect to third-party content, he added.

Together, these factors have made it hard to check the spread of misinformation online, he said.

He suggested that a fundamental relook of the law was needed to find a moderate middle road to address the problem.","That is why Singapore will have to be guided by its own circumstances in coming up with an approach to governance, to reap the maximum benefits from the Internet, he added.
Mr Daniel was delivering his second lecture on Stewardship Of The Singapore Media: Staying The Course, as the Institute of Policy Studies' 11th S R Nathan Fellow for the Study of Singapore.

These issues may be due to changes in sexual desire or problems with sexual function. This can affect a person’s sex life or cause intimacy difficulties. A note about sex and gender Sex and gender exist on spectrums. This article will use the terms “male,” “female,” or both to refer to sex assigned at birth. Click here to learn more. Was this helpful? Some people with PD may experience sexual problems, especially in the late stages of the disease. A person living with PD may be able to improve their sex life with certain treatments and strategies. This article will look at the impact of PD on sex and intimacy, as well as how to maintain a healthy sex life.

What factors contribute to sexual problems in those with PD? Share on Pinterest Hinterhaus Productions/Getty Images Certain factors can cause a person to develop sexual problems when they have PD. These factors include: Depression: The American Parkinson Disease Association states that up to 40% of people with PD also have depression. Depression can occur as a result of living with PD or due to changes in brain chemistry. It can reduce a person’s sexual function and lead to low sex drive. Research from 2018 found that 62.5% of males with depression in the study had a form of sexual dysfunction.

If a person is regularly low on energy, they may not want to engage in physical intimacy.

PD can make a person feel tired or fatigued. If a person is regularly low on energy, they may not want to engage in physical intimacy. Mobility issues: The tremor, rigidity, and slowness of movement characteristic of PD can affect a person’s ability to have sexual intercourse.

The tremor, rigidity, and slowness of movement characteristic of PD can affect a person’s ability to have sexual intercourse. Anxiety: Anxiety can decrease a person’s sex drive and ability to maintain an erection or orgasm.

Anxiety can decrease a person’s sex drive and ability to maintain an erection or orgasm. Sleep problems: Sleep problems, such as restless leg syndrome (RLS), can cause a person to feel fatigued. RLS is prevalent among those with PD.

How does it affect sex drive? PD can cause a person’s dopamine levels to drop. This occurs when dopamine-producing nerve cells in the part of the basal ganglia called the substantia nigra die. Dopamine is a chemical messenger that helps regulate coordinated movements. It is also involved in all types of positive feelings and pleasure, such as sexual pleasure. Dysregulated dopamine activity can cause behavioral changes, including a loss of interest in previously enjoyable activities. The American Parkinson Disease Association notes that if a person has low dopamine levels, they may have a reduced sex drive or interest in sex. Mobility issues that occur due to PD can interfere with comfort during sex. If a person finds sex uncomfortable or painful, they may not want to have it. On the other hand, less than 1% of people with PD will experience hypersexuality. Hypersexuality is when a person has a compulsive sex drive. Hypersexuality can cause : increased interest in sex

increased arousal

preoccupation with sexual thoughts

frequent desire for sex

use of sex lines, pornography, or sex workers Hypersexuality in PD could be due to a side effect of a PD medication called levodopa. If a person develops hypersexuality due to their PD treatment, they should speak with a doctor.

How does PD affect sex and intimacy? PD develops when nerve cells in the basal ganglia of the brain become impaired or die. The basal ganglia are a group of structures that help control movement. Mobility issues that occur due to PD may also cause intimacy problems. Mobility issues include: slowed movements

tremors

stiffness

pain

fatigue PD can affect a person’s autonomic nervous system (ANS). The ANS controls involuntary processes in the body, such as heart rate and digestion. The ANS is also responsible for sexual arousal. Research from 2021 found that issues with the ANS can cause erectile dysfunction and dry ejaculation.

Sexual problems affecting males with PD The following are sexual concerns that may affect males with PD: Erectile dysfunction According to the Michael J. Fox Foundation, erectile dysfunction is the most common sexual issue for a male who has PD. Men may find that they are unable to achieve or maintain an erection. Erectile dysfunction due to PD may be a result of the condition itself, medication used to treat it, or depression. Lack of climax PD can reduce sensation and function during sex, meaning achieving orgasm can be difficult. This can lead to frustration or dissatisfaction.

Sexual problems affecting females with PD Parkinson’s UK notes that females with PD are most likely to experience: Vaginal dryness and pain PD can lead to vaginal dryness in some females. This means the vagina may not be properly lubricated during sex. Vaginal dryness can lead to friction during sex, which can be uncomfortable or painful. Bladder infections are also common for females who have vaginal dryness. Lack of arousal or climax Females who have PD may also experience difficulty achieving orgasm. This may be due to issues with arousal or a result of pain and discomfort.

How to maintain a healthy sex life with PD There are many ways a person can improve their sex life if they have PD, such as: Being open and honest with each other Communication between partners is important if a person finds sex or intimacy difficult. A person should let their partner know how they feel and how PD is affecting their sex life. If a person finds that they are struggling to communicate with their partner, they may want to speak with a therapist. The therapist can help the couple open up to each other and facilitate change. Speaking with a doctor about medications If a person suspects that their PD medication is affecting their sex life, they should speak to a doctor. A doctor may be able to change a person’s medication to something more suitable. Additionally, a doctor may be able to prescribe medication that could help a person’s sexual function. This may include antidepressants or erectile dysfunction medication, such as sildenafil (Viagra). Methods to try during sexual activity Sexual experimentation can help a person with PD figure out what works best for them and their partner. Experimenting may involve: using lubricants during penetration

trying different forms of simulation

using sex toys

trying new positions

applying oils to the skin to reduce friction from tremors

putting satin sheets on the bed to reduce friction

trying new things, such as roleplaying or dressing up

trying positions that reduce strain and discomfort","Challenges related to sex and intimacy can occur when a person has Parkinson’s disease (PD).

The number of new COVID-19 cases is in steep decline in many parts of the U.S., but it's still unknown how many of the people who've had the illness will develop the lingering symptoms of long COVID-19.

Journalist Meghan O'Rourke, who has been writing about long COVID-19 for The Atlantic and Scientific American, says as the coronavirus pandemic was starting to unfold in the U.S., she was dreading ""the prospect of a tremendous wave of chronic illness that would follow.""

That's because O'Rourke has firsthand experience living with poorly understood chronic conditions. That has made her sensitive to the struggles of patients living with hard-to-diagnose diseases who often have had their symptoms dismissed by a medical system that can't pin them down.

Long COVID-19 can be similarly hard to characterize. The term encompasses ""a wide variety of symptoms that persist long after the initial infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus,"" O'Rourke says. ""Those symptoms might include chest pain, but they also include so-called vague and subjective symptoms like brain fog or fatigue and roaming pain in the body.""

The symptoms of long COVID-19 can be difficult to track on conventional lab tests, in part because they may come and go over time. ""And all of this puts pressure on patients who then have to testify to the reality of their own illness,"" O'Rourke says.

O'Rourke writes about her own experience struggling to get a diagnosis in her new book, The Invisible Kingdom: Reimagining Chronic Illness. For O'Rourke, it all started in the late 1990s, soon after graduating from college. Over the years, her symptoms have included extreme fatigue, brain fog, joint pain, nerve pain, hives, fevers and more. She visited a number of specialists, but more often than not, the doctors attributed what she was experiencing to stress or anxiety.

""The hardest part of being ill was that I didn't feel I had any advocate on my side who even believed fully in the reality of what I was describing to them,"" she says. ""When you're at the edge of medical knowledge, the lack of evidence is treated as evidence that the problem is you and your mind. ... I felt, in a sense, kind of locked away in a room like a 19th-century hysteric.""

When you're at the edge of medical knowledge, the lack of evidence is treated as evidence that the problem is you and your mind. ... I felt, in a sense, kind of locked away in a room like a 19th-century hysteric.

Eventually, O'Rourke found a team of doctors whom she likens to ""detectives at my side."" She was diagnosed with autoimmune thyroiditis, a disease in which the body begins attacking the thyroid, as well as with Lyme disease and the genetic condition Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.

For O'Rourke, just getting a diagnosis felt like a triumph. But she acknowledges that many others who suffer from chronic illnesses don't have the same resources to continue seeking treatment.

""It's really clear from research that, in fact, social structures are a major factor in all of this,"" she says. ""I think we're witnessing a calamity that is one not of personal failure, but of societal failure, and one that we really need to reckon with openly.""

She spoke with Fresh Air's Terry Gross about her new book, chronic illness and long COVID-19.

On current theories and research about the cause of long COVID-19 and its impact on chronic diseases

When we get sick, our immune system springs into action, trying to get rid of the pathogens that have entered, or even invaded, our body, and tries to push them out. And so one theory of long COVID has been that in some people, that immune response just doesn't turn off for a wide variety of reasons. And so they keep getting damage to their body done by their own immune system, either an autoimmune process or inflammation.

There's also some evidence suggesting that in some parts of the body, fragments of the virus remain or in other parts that the virus itself remains, persisting and triggering ongoing immune action. ...

One of the great mysteries is: Why do some people get a mild case of acute COVID and then end up unable to walk up and down stairs, almost bedridden, subsumed in brain fog? A recent study found that there are some indicators that can tell us a little bit about who might be prone to get long COVID. One such indicator is the level of coronavirus RNA in your blood early on in the infection.

That tells us something about that term ""viral load."" If you have a high viral load early in your infection, even if your symptoms are mild, you might end up with long COVID. There's also evidence that some of these things called ""autoantibodies,"" which are the antibodies in autoimmune disease ... that instead of attacking those pathogens that are coming into your body, actually end up mistakenly, mysteriously attacking your own tissue instead. Another factor is people who have reactivated Epstein-Barr virus, which many of us have had, but some of us have these episodes of reactivation that can be a sign that you might develop long COVID, and another is the presence of Type 2 diabetes.

On how her experiences with chronic illness made her aware of long COVID-19 early on in the pandemic

What kept me up at night as the coronavirus pandemic came to the United States was not just the wave of acute infections that were clearly coming, but also the prospect of a tremendous wave of chronic illness that would follow them. The research I had been doing already for five years had taught me that in many cases, infections can leave ongoing problems in a subset of patients in ways that we're just beginning in medical science to really research and understand.

Many autoimmune diseases are triggered by viruses, in fact. It's the interaction of a virus or an infection with your own genetics [that] can, in some cases, trigger conditions like lupus or multiple sclerosis, as we just found out in a big study. So I had been talking to virologists and researchers who work on the ways that Epstein-Barr creates all kinds of lung conditions. And reading these early reports of the severity of the SARS-CoV-2 virus just had me worrying that a tremendous number of people were going to get sick and never get better.

So I was kind of lurking on message boards and reading around from pretty much April of 2020 to see what I was seeing and pretty quickly just started seeing these terrifying messages that reminded me so much of my own case where people were saying, ""I just never got better. I got sick. I have brain fog. My energy is gone. I'm not the person I once was."" I read those with a chill of recognition.

On connecting the 19th-century diagnosis of ""hysteria"" to today's autoimmune diseases

A lot of women who ended up diagnosed with hysteria had abdominal pain, bouts of fatigue, symptoms that came and went. So doctors originally were trying to kind of figure out what was wrong with these women, and they thought that it was a disorder of the nervous system, which was newly discovered and something there was a lot of excitement around. And when they couldn't find an answer in their tests, they then ended up abandoning that idea. Doctors start to increasingly talk about the ways that hysteria is caused by women's brains, that women are trying to use their brains too much and so therefore they're sick.

The reason I [say] autoimmune diseases and chronic fatigue syndrome, or myalgic encephalomyelitis, and chronic Lyme disease and fibromyalgia ... are today's ""hysteria"" is that ... in the research I did, you can see medicine is incredibly uncomfortable with areas of uncertainty, diseases it can't measure, diseases it doesn't have a really clear handle on. And so when ... anyone who has one of these diseases goes into a doctor's office and says, ""Doctor, I'm experiencing fatigue. I'm experiencing brain fog. It comes and goes,"" you very quickly get to the question of whether you're anxious. ...

There's this really fascinating phenomenon in current medical science in which patients who live at the edge of medical knowledge, patients whose diseases we have a tough time measuring or we just don't understand yet ... rather than being told, ""Hey, you're probably someone who has something I don't understand,"" such patients are often told: ""I think you should see a psychiatrist. I think you are suffering from anxiety. Maybe you have depression.""

I want to be really clear: Advances in how we treat mental illness are one of the great triumphs of 20th-century medicine, and it's really important to talk about mental health and chronic illness. But the problem I kept seeing patients talk to me about — and what happened to me — is that doctors often go to the suspicion of anxiety in a way that forecloses further investigation into what might be going on.

On why she found integrative medicine helpful

The reason I found it so helpful was that they take a whole-body approach. They are medically trained doctors, so they're looking at your labs and they're prescribing medication when appropriate, but they were also talking to me about things like my sleeping habits, the level of stress in my life and food sensitivities and trying to really help me figure out what foods made me feel better and what foods made me feel worse, because a lot of the time when I ate, I just felt really sick afterwards — I got terrible headaches. So they worked with me very patiently to try to manage my illness. ...

I think working with integrative doctors helped me feel that I did have a partner in my health care. I'm a very evidence-based person, so one always has questions about some of the aspects of medicine that are less well studied, like supplements and all of that, but in my case, it just became really clear that what these doctors were doing with me, the kinds of lifestyle changes they were advocating, made a big difference in my day-to-day functioning.

On why she believes chronic illness is representative of this time we're living in

One of the things I found in my reporting was that many people who lived with these illnesses, who lived with autoimmunity, thought that the problem was something in themselves ... that they were living an inauthentic life. They hadn't lived the life they should lead. And in this way, they took their illness and they turned it into a metaphor for personal inauthenticity that only they could overcome, which is a huge burden for an individual to live with. ...

These diseases kind of allow both sick people and people who are healthy to see the problem as an individual problem, [and that] allows us to look away from the social factors that are contributing to the rise of these diseases. So everything from food deserts to lack of chemical regulation to probably our chronically fast-paced lifestyles and lack of social safety nets for new mothers and all sorts of things. I really just came to think that these diseases reveal something to us about our culture in a way that made them deeply representative of aspects of the time that we needed to look more deeply at.

It remains challenging to tackle these diseases, not least because data on rare diseases are enormously fragmented, spread across several hundred registries in Europe.

That’s why the JRC, together with the EU Commission’s Directorate-General for Health and Food Safety, launched the European Platform on Rare Disease Registration in 2019 .

A core component of the Platform is its Central Metadata Repository, which stores all types of variables used by various registries. The JRC released a new and completely revamped version in January 2022, where both access and use have been significantly simplified. This includes a new user-friendly web interface, as well as the integration of conversion and upload tools, to allow for easy integration of metadata, ultimately making it easier to use the data for overarching studies and research purposes.

Cutting-edge research led by University of Ottawa Faculty of Medicine Associate Professors Dr. Emilio Alarcon and Dr. Erik Suuronen suggests a spray-on technology using customized nanoparticles of one of the world's most precious metals offers tremendous therapeutic potential and could eventually help save many lives. Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally, claiming roughly 18 million lives each year.

In a paper recently published online in ACS Nano, a peer-reviewed journal that highlighted the new research on its supplementary cover, Dr. Alarcon and his team of fellow investigators suggest that this approach might one day be used in conjunction with coronary artery bypass surgeries. That's the most common type of heart surgery.

The therapy tested by the researchers – which was sprayed on the hearts of lab mice – used very low concentrations of peptide-modified particles of gold created in the laboratory. From the nozzle of a miniaturized spraying apparatus, the material can be evenly painted on the surface of a heart within a few seconds.

Gold nanoparticles have been shown to have some unusual properties and are highly chemically reactive. For years, researchers have been employing gold nanoparticles – so tiny they are undetectable by the human eye – in such a wide range of technologies that it's become an area of intense research interest.

In this case, the custom-made nanogold modified with peptides-;a short chain of amino acids -;was sprayed on the hearts of lab mice. The research found that the spray-on therapy not only resulted in an increase in cardiac function and heart electrical conductivity but that there was no off-target organ infiltration by the tiny gold particles.

""That's the beauty of this approach. You spray, then you wait a couple of weeks, and the animals are doing just fine compared to the controls,"" says Dr. Alarcon, who is part of the Faculty of Medicine's Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Immunology and also Director of the Bio-nanomaterials Chemistry and Engineering Laboratory at the University of the Ottawa Heart Institute.

Dr. Alarcon says that not only does the data suggest that the therapeutic action of the spray-on nanotherapeutic is highly effective, but its application is far simpler than other regenerative approaches for treating an infarcted heart.

At first, the observed improvement of cardiac function and electrical signal propagation in the hearts of tested mice was hard for the team to believe. But repeated experiments delivered the same positive results, according to Dr. Alarcon, who is part of the Faculty of Medicine's Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Immunology and Director of the Bio-nanomaterials Chemistry and Engineering Laboratory at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute.

To validate the exciting findings in mice, the team is now seeking to adapt this technology to minimally invasive procedures that will expedite testing in large animal models, such as rabbits and pigs.

Dr. Alarcon praised the research culture at uOttawa and the Heart Institute, saying that the freedom to explore is paramount.

When you have an environment where you are allowed to make mistakes and criticize, that really drives discoveries."" Dr. Emilio Alarcon, Associate Professor, University of Ottawa Faculty of Medicine

The team involved in the paper includes researchers from uOttawa and the University of Talca in Chile.

Español

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today issued draft guidance that provides food manufacturers with recommendations on how and when to use Dietary Guidance Statements on the label of food products to ensure the label statements promote good nutrition, provide greater consistency in labeling, and assist consumers in making informed choices. This guidance is part of the FDA’s overall goal to help reduce the burden of chronic disease and advance health equity through improved nutrition.

“Diet-related chronic diseases, are the leading causes of death and disability in the U.S. and disproportionally impact communities of color and people living in rural areas,” said FDA Commissioner Robert M. Califf, M.D. “The FDA is committed to being a part of the solution to improve the health of millions of Americans. Today’s action is another step towards helping consumers make informed choices about the foods they eat.”

Today’s eating patterns in the U.S. do not align with current federal dietary recommendations, which focus on the entirety of the diet and how foods and beverages work together to affect health. Dietary Guidance Statements are statements in food labeling which are based on key recommendations from consensus reports, such as the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025, that discuss how a food or food group can be a part of a nutritious dietary pattern. The statements may include symbols or pictures that convey to consumers that a food or a food group may contribute to, or help maintain, a nutritious dietary pattern.

Examples of Dietary Guidance Statements include: “Make half your grains whole grain,” and “Eat leafy green vegetables as part of a nutritious dietary patten.” The draft guidance provides the agency’s thinking about the use of such statements, including recommendations that products contain a meaningful amount of the food, or category of foods, that is the subject of the statement, and that they also not exceed certain amounts of saturated fat, sodium and added sugars. The recommendations in the guidance can enhance consistency in the use of such statements and consumer understanding as well as facilitate industry innovation toward healthier foods. Like other labeling statements and claims, Dietary Guidance Statements act as quick signals on food packages to help consumers better understand nutrition information and make healthier food choices.

Today’s action is part of the FDA’s overall nutrition initiatives, which include empowering consumers by providing more informative labeling and education, including tailored messages for various audiences to help consumers identify foods that can contribute to healthier diets. It is also part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s National Strategy on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health, which provides a roadmap of actions the federal government will take to end hunger and reduce diet-related diseases by 2030 – all while reducing disparities. Complementing today’s guidance and the National Strategy, the FDA issued a proposed rule in September 2022 to update the definition of “healthy” on food labels and help consumers more easily identify healthy food choices. The agency’s work also supports the Biden-Harris Administration’s White House Challenge to End Hunger and Build Healthy Communities, a nationwide call-to-action to stakeholders across all of society to make bold commitments to advance the Strategy’s goals. The

Challenge builds on the success of the $8 billion package of private and public sector commitments that the Administration announced as part of the historic conference.

Another priority of the FDA’s nutrition efforts is to create a healthier food supply for all. In October 2021, the FDA issued final guidance for the food industry that provided voluntary, short-term sodium reduction targets for a broad range of processed, packaged and prepared foods to help reduce the amount of sodium in the U.S. food supply.

“In addition to the Dietary Guidance Statements draft guidance, reducing sodium intake and updating the definition of “healthy” are two other examples of how the agency is showing its commitment to fostering a healthier food supply for all and empowering consumers with more informative and accessible labeling to choose healthier diets,” said Susan Mayne, Ph.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. “We are making great strides in our nutrition initiatives in order to improve the health and wellness of our nation.”

The FDA remains committed to doing its part in the all-of-government approach to improving nutrition, which can have a lasting generational impact on reducing chronic diseases and advancing health equity. The agency is moving forward with additional nutrition and labeling priorities, including exploring a “front-of-pack” labeling initiative and recommendations for nutrition labeling for online grocery shopping sites. Additionally, the FDA will begin assessing further strategies to reduce added sugar consumption, which includes collaborating with others in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Department of Agriculture to hold a public meeting regarding future steps the federal government could take to reduce intake of added sugars.

Children with congenital heart disease (CHD) have much to think about as they undergo tests, try medications, and face possible surgery. These adults know what that’s like. To celebrate National Heart Month, here are their words of encouragement.

Frank Collins, 63

I loved basketball as a kid, but when I played I would get tired before anyone else. When I was 7, I was diagnosed with a heart murmur. After some delays, I had surgery at Boston Children’s Hospital just two days after my 10th birthday. I knew if I had surgery, I could do the things I saw other kids doing and that I desperately wanted to do.

As Frank Collins donated blood in 2020, Boston Children’s Blood Donor Center team gave him a cake to celebrate the 51st anniversary of his heart surgery. (Image: Casey Powell, Boston Children’s Hospital.)

I remember looking up at the anesthesiologist putting the mask over my face. That was it. I was out. Almost 10 hours later, I had a temporary drainage tube in my chest. When I finally opened my eyes, my mom and dad had big smiles on their faces. I then saw a picture of a puppy taped to the guardrails of my bed. It was my gift: Schnitzel, a girl beagle I would have for 13 years.

I finally kept up with the best of them. I restarted basketball and played semi-pro softball into my 30s. I was in the Air Force, Navy Reserve, and Air National Guard. I worked as a commercial airline mechanic and construction machine mechanic, while also at one point renovating my house. And I was a full-time father to Jordan, who is now 30. I like to say there is nothing wrong with Frank Collins’ heart.

Knowing what I know about Boston Children’s, your parents brought you to the best place. Have faith in your doctors. Know that getting you fixed is their number one goal. And you should have special goals. If your condition is holding you back, this treatment will get you to where you will no longer be held back. You’ll want to get through this, so do what they tell you, and you’ll get better.

Fran Sansalone, 75

I was born with tetralogy of Fallot. Congenital heart disease right from birth is just the life you live. You grow up accepting it while learning about it. It wasn’t until I entered school and couldn’t take gym that I realized I was different. I had to sit on the sidelines.

Fran wants children with CHD to know that life will be better. “I can’t say it will be perfect, but it will likely be better.”

I had six cardiac catheterizations before high school. In those days, a patient was awake with minimal anesthesia. I finally had my first heart surgery at 19, and another one in my early 20s. After a few checkups, I didn’t see a cardiologist for decades. I felt good and I moved on. Then in 2001, I read about a Boston Children’s research project on tetralogy of Fallot, and that’s what led me to become a patient in the Boston Adult Congenital Heart (BACH) Program. When I come in for annual checkups, I sit in a waiting room with children.

I want those children — and any other young person with CHD— to know that life will be better. After treatment, I hope this piece of your life will disappear or be modified. I can’t say it will be perfect, but it will likely be better. Another thing: I always liked what Mr. Rogers said, “I like you just the way you are.” It’s a valuable message to give any child. But a child with CHD might look at the rest of the world and feel deficient in comparison. It’s easy to think everyone else has got their act together or is a superstar — it’s easy to feel deficient in comparison. Guess what? Not true. Just like Mr. Rogers said, “I like you just the way you are.”

Launched on Tuesday (March 8), the Cardiovascular Systems Imaging and Artificial Intelligence (CVS.AI) lab is the first of its kind to be set up by a healthcare provider in Singapore and South-east Asia, said NHCS.

The use of AI in detecting and monitoring the progression of heart disease could allow for early intervention and counter the world's top killer disease, which takes about 17.9 million lives each year.

In Singapore, one-third of all deaths are due to cardiovascular disease - with 19 people dying from heart diseases or stroke each day.

NHCS, which sees more than 120,000 outpatients a year, performed nearly 17,000 cardiac scans last year alone.

These are images of the heart and blood vessels taken using methods such as magnetic resonance imaging, computerised tomography and nuclear imaging methods.

The structure and function of the heart and its arteries can be analysed from these scans, such as by detecting plaque on artery walls or heart muscle damage due to blocked blood supply.

""AI can potentially capture and make sense of complex information in a multidimensional manner that cannot be done by a human interpreter - improving predictive ability and reducing labour and time intensive processes in analysing scan images,"" said Assistant Professor Lohendran Baskaran, clinical lead at CVS.AI and a consultant at NHCS.

Not only can AI analyse the images to a greater level of detail such that it identifies even subtle changes that would escape detection by the human eye, but it also does this in a fraction of the time it takes a radiologist - mere minutes, compared with between two and four hours.

NHCS medical director Terrance Chua said this allows for more precise assessment of patients' risk of heart disease, allowing doctors to prescribe preventive treatments effectively.

""Over time, this can potentially save costs, broaden accessibility of cardiac scans to patients, and improve overall healthcare for our population,"" Professor Chua added.

Prof Baskaran also said that CVS.AI is armed with the technical hardware and software to securely transmit, store and process patient's information.

The lab's technical lead, Associate Professor Zhong Liang - who is also principal investigator of NHRIS - said that its location at the National Heart Research Institute Singapore (NHRIS) at NHCS in the Singapore General Hospital Campus also ""allows for a constant influx of real world data and daily information that can go towards helping the AI algorithms improve"".

399,399,https://www.healthline.com/health/is-osteoporosis-an-autoimmune-disease,Is Osteoporosis an Autoimmune Disease?,"Osteoporosis is a condition that affects your bone density. It often occurs in: women after menopause

people of all genders as they age

people who have other health conditions like autoimmune diseases It is a “silent” condition that can occur for many years before you notice symptoms, like bone fractures or shrinking height. Osteoporosis is not an autoimmune disease. But research suggests a malfunctioning immune system may cause osteoporosis. Scientists are studying this link between changes in your bones and your immune system. Diagnosing both osteoporosis and any underlying autoimmune disease is important to managing the conditions and reducing problematic symptoms later.

Osteoporosis and the immune system Some developing research focuses on how osteoporosis is influenced by the immune system and if it’s related to autoimmune diseases. The immune system and bone system are linked. They share certain molecules and regulatory mechanisms. Researchers want to find out more about how this link may cause bone loss. Your immune system exists to fight outside germs that make you sick, but it can malfunction. Sometimes, your immune system creates proteins called autoantibodies that attack healthy cells in your body. This is called autoimmune disease. These autoantibodies can affect your entire body, including your organs, joints, and skin. This can result in painful and debilitating symptoms. A 2017 review suggests that autoantibodies, as well as chronic inflammation, can contribute to bone loss. Immune cells affect the remodeling of bones, so changes in your immune system can affect the density of your bones. More studies looking into this link could help doctors to better understand osteoporosis and find more effective treatments for it.

What causes osteoporosis? Doctors classify osteoporosis as either primary or secondary, depending on what causes it. Primary osteoporosis Most people with osteoporosis have primary osteoporosis. According to a 2017 review , 80 percent of women and 60 percent of men with osteoporosis have this type. One or more of these factors can lead to primary osteoporosis: aging

menopause

family history

lifestyle factors like diet and exercise The Office on Women’s Health says that women develop primary osteoporosis more than men. It often occurs after menopause because of a change in estrogen levels. Estrogen helps keep your bones strong. Men, too, can experience primary osteoporosis as a result of changes in testosterone and estrogen levels. Language matters We use “women” and “men” in this article to reflect the terms that have been historically used to gender people. But your gender identity may not align with how your body responds to this disease. Your doctor can better help you understand how your specific circumstances will translate into diagnosis, symptoms, and treatment. Was this helpful? Secondary osteoporosis Secondary osteoporosis is when the disease is caused by other health conditions. These include autoimmune disease and connective tissue disorders. It may also occur as a side effect of some medications, such as steroids used to treat autoimmune diseases. The medical field is currently expanding its research to understand how osteoporosis and autoimmune diseases may be linked. Osteoporosis makes your bones more brittle, and they may fracture easily. You may experience a fracture in your hips, spine, or another bone. Fractures can occur years after the onset of the condition, so it’s important to visit a doctor to determine whether you may be susceptible to bone loss. Talk with your doctor if you fall into any of the risk categories for primary or secondary osteoporosis.

Diagnosing osteoporosis with autoimmune disease Your doctor can conduct tests to determine whether you have osteoporosis along with an autoimmune disease. There is not one single test to diagnose both conditions, so your diagnosis will involve a few different methods. Traditional tests for osteoporosis look at bone mineral density. This is an imaging test completed while you lie flat on a table. Your doctor will be able to determine your entire body’s bone density. They will also be able to determine the bone density in various parts of your body where you might be more vulnerable to fractures, like your back and hips. Determining if you also have an autoimmune disease will require laboratory tests. One type of blood test that looks for a variety of these conditions is the antinuclear antibody (ANA) test. Other tests may look for certain proteins and inflammation in your blood or urine. Your doctor may also order an X-ray or other imaging studies to help make a diagnosis. These tests can help detect autoimmune diseases like ankylosing spondylitis. Elevated levels in laboratory tests might mean that your immune system is not working properly. Your doctor can use this information, along with your bone density scan, family history, and a physical examination, to determine a treatment plan for your symptoms.","Diagnosing both osteoporosis and any underlying autoimmune disease is important to managing the conditions and reducing problematic symptoms later.

A non-invasive ultrasound treatment for Parkinson’s disease that was tested in a pivotal trial led by University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSOM) researchers is now broadly available at the University of Maryland Medical Center (UMMC).

(top l-r) Howard Eisenberg, MD, Dheeraj Gandhi, MD, MBBS, (bottom l-r) Paul Fishman, MD, PhD, Bert W. O’Malley, MD.

The device, called Exablate Neuro, was approved in November by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat advanced Parkinson’s disease on one side of the brain. The approval was based on findings from the UMSOM clinical trial and effectively expands access to focused ultrasound beyond clinical trial participation.

Rapid Reversal of Symptoms

Focused ultrasound is an incisionless procedure, performed without the need for anesthesia or an in-patient stay in the hospital. Patients, who are fully alert, lie in a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner, wearing a transducer helmet. Ultrasonic energy is targeted through the skull to the globus pallidus, a structure deep in the brain that helps control regular voluntary movement. MRI images provide doctors with a real-time temperature map of the area being treated. During the procedure, the patient is awake and providing feedback, which allows doctors to monitor the immediate effects of the tissue ablation and make adjustments as needed.

Soon after treatment begins, patients often experience relief from severe symptoms such as tremors, rigidity in the legs and arms, and side effects from medications that cause involuntary, erratic movements called “dyskinesia.”

About one million Americans have Parkinson’s disease, a neurodegenerative disorder that affects brain cells or neurons in a specific area of the brain that produce the brain chemical dopamine. Other current treatments for Parkinson’s include medications and deep brain stimulation from surgically implanted electrodes.

“Focused ultrasound has less ominous side effects for patients since there’s no risk of infection or damage to blood vessels from the electrodes,” said Howard Eisenberg, MD, the Raymond K. Thompson Professor of Neurosurgery at UMSOM and a neurosurgeon at UMMC who served as principal investigator on the study that led to the approval of Exablate Neuro. “Presently, it can only be used to treat one side of the brain, so it may more appropriate for patients with symptoms predominantly on one side. However, research into bilateral focused ultrasound is ongoing and shows very promising results.”

Patient: Focused Ultrasound Changed My Life

Parkinson’s disease not only robs people over time of their mobility, but erodes social networks built over years of shared interests and experiences. Symptoms like involuntary head shaking and jerking of the limbs — which can also be caused by their medications — may cause many to feel acutely self-conscious to the point of avoiding almost all social activity.

One man who managed to stave off this devastating outcome was an early participant in clinical trials for focused ultrasound led by UMSOM researchers at the medical center. For this patient, relief came within minutes before the procedure was even completed — which ultimately eliminated 95 percent of the involuntary movements caused by his medication and reduced his tremors by half. More than seven years later, these benefits have lasted, although his disease has advanced on other fronts.

“The focused ultrasound I received at the University of Maryland Medical Center changed my life by giving me back the ability to do the things I love. I’m in a competitive bowling league. I play golf. I ride my bike,” said Steve Squires, 46, of Middlebury, Ind., who had the procedure in 2015 as part of the pilot study.

Squires noted that while focused ultrasound isn’t a cure for Parkinson’s, it helped him return to many of his normal activities. “It also gave me a platform to share with others who have Parkinson’s that there are new treatment options — you don’t have to suffer this alone,” he said.

In a pilot study published last year in the Journal of Neurosurgery, Eisenberg and his colleagues tested the focused ultrasound device on 20 patients with Parkinson’s disease and found that the vast majority of patients experienced a clinically meaningful improvement in their motor-skill symptoms like tremors that lasted through one year of follow-up. Only one patient experienced a progression of their disease during that time, and none experienced any serious adverse events from the treatment itself. A more recent randomized controlled study involving 89 patients, a third of whom initially had a sham procedure, yielded similar results. It was the basis for the device approval.

“We have had great experience using this focused ultrasound technique in clinical trials and can now offer this less invasive treatment option to those with Parkinson’s symptoms,” said study co-author Paul Fishman, MD, PhD, professor of neurology at UMSOM and a neurologist at UMMC. Dheeraj Gandhi, MD, MBBS, professor of radiology, neurosurgery, and neurology and director of Interventional Neuroradiology at UMSOM, and an interventional neuroradiologist at UMMC, was also a co-author of the study. They are planning a new trial in coming months to use the device to treat patients on both sides of the brain.

A New Era for Parkinson’s Disease Treatment

“A diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease no longer automatically portends a future of extremely limited physical capabilities. Thanks to the commitment of researchers like Dr. Eisenberg and Dr. Fishman — and clinical trial participants like Steve Squires — treatment has expanded to include non-invasive options that significantly reduce certain symptoms within minutes and last for years,” said Bert W. O’Malley, MD, president and CEO of the University of Maryland Medical Center.

“Our School of Medicine researchers have established themselves as world leaders in pioneering MRI-guided focused ultrasound for many devastating brain diseases including Parkinson’s and essential tremors,” said E. Albert Reece, MD, PhD, MBA, executive vice president for medical affairs, University of Maryland, Baltimore, and the John Z. and Akiko K. Bowers Distinguished Professor and dean, UMSOM. ""The stellar work of Dr. Eisenberg and Dr. Fishman has led to a new era in which this breakthrough modality has now become the standard of care for patients looking for less invasive treatments for their symptoms.”","| By Deborah KotzA non-invasive ultrasound treatment for Parkinson’s disease that was tested in a pivotal trial led by University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSOM) researchers is now broadly available at the University of Maryland Medical Center (UMMC).
The device, called Exablate Neuro, was approved in November by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat advanced Parkinson’s disease on one side of the brain.
The approval was based on findings from the UMSOM clinical trial and effectively expands access to focused ultrasound beyond clinical trial participation.
Squires noted that while focused ultrasound isn’t a cure for Parkinson’s, it helped him return to many of his normal activities.

402,402,https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-find-common-link-between-distinct-neurodegenerative-diseases,A Common Link Between Several Neurodegenerative Diseases Might Finally Be Identified,"There's a hallmark of incurable neurodegenerative diseases – misfolded proteins that clump together to form sticky plaques or tangles called fibrils.

Now, new research has discovered that a protein normally tasked with clearing cells of molecular debris might be a common feature of a cluster of common and rare neurodegenerative diseases, including two distinct forms of dementia.

The finding was ""both unexpected and surprising"" and ""raises many intriguing questions"", according to the team behind the study, who made 3D-reconstructions of a twisted protein they found in ""copious amounts"" in some brain tissue samples.

""We have found that a protein called TMEM106B can form fibrils, and this behavior was not known before,"" says biophysicist and study author Xinyu Xiang of Stanford University.

The team extracted bulk proteins from brain tissue donated by 11 patients who had died from one of three neurodegenerative diseases: frontotemporal dementia, the most common form of dementia for people under age 60; progressive supranuclear palsy, a rare brain disorder which impairs balance, walking and vision; or dementia with Lewy bodies, a type of dementia often confused with Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease.

""Each of these diseases has a unique protein tangle, or fibril, associated with it,"" says structural biologist Anthony Fitzpatrick of Columbia University. ""These proteins associated with diseases have their own shapes and behaviors.""

But in all 11 post-mortem brain samples, Fitzpatrick and colleagues found some previously undetected fibrils which, on closer inspection, appear to point ""toward a commonality between these diverse neurodegenerative diseases.""

To investigate, the researchers used a technique called cryo-electron microscopy, or cryo-EM, which involves flash-freezing proteins to capture the fine details of their shape and structure, and is capable of resolving molecular features that are just 2 angstroms across – significantly smaller than a nanometer.

Fragments of the mysterious protein formed narrow twisted rods or stacked into wide, symmetric twisted ribbons, and this was most pronounced in the cases of frontotemporal dementia.

Based on these molecular structures, the researchers inferred the most probable sequence of the protein's amino-acid building blocks. When they scanned a database of known protein sequences, the fragments matched a protein that was actually identified more than a decade ago in a broad hunt for genes linked with frontotemporal dementia.

That protein is TMEM106B, which usually sits snug in the membranes of lysosomes and endosomes – two types of cell substructures (organelles) which gobble up cellular debris, malfunctioning proteins, and worn-out cell parts.

Cryo-EM images of protein fibrils found in brain tissue samples (Chang et al., Cell, 2021)

The researchers speculate that the TMEM106B protein fragments and forms fibrils, which in turn disrupts lysosome function. This leads to a build-up of other known fibril-forming proteins, such as tau, which is implicated in Alzheimer's disease.

At this early stage, the microscopy data don't show that TMEM106B causes neurodegenerative disease, only that it happens to be present in the diseased brain tissue of a few people with different neurodegenerative diseases.

Also, finding that TMEM106B fibrils ""occur across diverse proteinopathies makes it difficult to determine whether TMEM106B fibrils are disease-specific or are a general feature of neurodegeneration and aging,"" the team writes. They also note that another study, not yet peer-reviewed, recently found TMEM106B filaments in the brains of healthy older adults but not younger individuals.

What's more, Fitzpatrick and colleagues didn't detect these protein fibrils in their past studies of Alzheimer's disease and another brain disorder called corticobasal degeneration, so TMEM106B fibrils may not be a common feature across all neurodegenerative diseases, just some. It might also reflect the small number of samples analyzed thus far, from various brain regions.

Untangling what triggers the formation of TMEM106B fibrils, and if their presence amplifies or accelerates the accumulation of pathological proteins, as Fitzpatrick and colleagues suspect, could help to resolve some of these questions.

""We now have a promising new lead,"" says Fitzpatrick. ""It could point towards a common thread linking a range of neurodegenerative diseases and could open the way to new interventions.""

Bear in mind, however, that decades of research into therapies targeting the protein thought to be the main culprit in Alzheimer's disease, amyloid-beta, have led to many failed trials and much disappointment.

So, while there may be some commonalities between neurodegenerative diseases, their individual root causes remain elusive.

He has identified preventive care as a tool and plans to get state and local governments to key into measures encourage such as vaccinations, eye tests, and cancer screening, blood pressure monitoring and diabetes testing.

“Such preventative care services will be grassroot based, gender sensitive, and affordable,” his health plan states, noting that President’s Muhammadu Buhari’s restructuring of the national health insurance scheme will serve as a great footing to begin its execution.

But if the plan must move from paper concept to practical solutions, it must be ready to pass the test of scale, stakeholders says.

For cancer treatment in particular, health advocates are looking to see a more inclusive package that eases the burden of patients.

The impact of the current package under the NHIS is feather weight for roughly 90 percent of the population, who are uninsured and face the dire effects of a health system where about 77 percent of health expenditure is out-of-pocket.

The NHIS in 2019 for instance began to cover some cancer medications which are used for treatment. They have been included on the essential medicine list.

However, the provision does not cover most of the expensive drugs required for treatment which often runs into millions.

A large pool of cancer patients increasingly young are also not under the vulnerable group which now as a special fund. The NHIS does not cover surgery and radiotherapy among others.

Runcie Chidebe, executive director, Project Pink Blue, a non-profit cancer advocacy group, in an interview, told BusinessDay he expects the government will widen the vulnerable group to include both people who are indigent financially, and others battling terminal diseases or disease who their treatments are really expensive.

“The healthcare system in Nigeria is largely in the hands of donor agencies and not the government. The responsibility on the government to implement the National Health Act of that stipulates 15 percent of the national budget should go to healthcare should be held to seriously for a change,” he said.

According to Femi Olugbile, 70 percent of things that typically take people to hospital are already covered under the national insurance act. It could offset the majority of the health costs and would provide a significant relief on the already high out-of-pocket expenditure of Nigerians.

“It now depends on whether the government has the will to implement these plans. That’s the big elephant in the room. If they have the muscle to enforce then that will be a major game-changer. Government still has to show willingness and deliberate intent and muscle to execute,” he said.

Stakeholders have also called for actions towards the initiative to establish a National Catastrophic Fund to specifically address terminal ailments such as cancer, advanced heart disease, among others.

Mohammed Sambo, director-general of the scheme had in 2021 said that the contributions to the health insurance pool was insufficient to cater for some packages and programmes of the scheme.

Sufficient funds could help the authority cover the treatment and management of cancers and other terminal diseases fully, he said.

Under Tinubu’s plan, the goal is to increase health spending braising the allocation of healthcare in the national budget. His government plans to scale-up the National Health Insurance Authority Act to cover at least 40 percent of the population within two years.

“We will also expand public-sector driven mandatory health insurance coverage while augmenting the financial mechanism such as the Basic Health Care Provision Fund and Vulnerable Group Fund to cover vulnerable in order to provide universal basic healthcare to all,” Tinubu wrote.

In addition to other sources, funds saved by the removal of the fuel subsidy would be earmarked to provide health coverage.","“Such preventative care services will be grassroot based, gender sensitive, and affordable,” his health plan states, noting that President’s Muhammadu Buhari’s restructuring of the national health insurance scheme will serve as a great footing to begin its execution.

First-half goals from Harry Kane and Bukayo Saka helped England seal a dominant 2-0 victory over Ukraine in Group C of their Euro 2024 qualifying at Wembley on Sunday.

Gareth Southgate's side have now won back-to-back games to begin their bid to qualify for the next European Championships following Thursday's win over Italy. The pair of matches were also their first since being knocked out in the quarterfinals of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

Harry Kane opened the scoring with a well-taken volley from inside the six-yard box that went through the legs of Ukraine goalkeeper Anatoliy Trubin. The strike was Kane's 55th goal for England, coming days after he broke the country's all-time scoring record, previously held by Wayne Rooney, against Italy.

Saka doubled England's lead just three minutes later with an eye-catching curled strike from the edge of the box into the far corner.

Ukraine had their moments and enjoyed some pressure after the interval but never really looked capable of claiming only a second victory over England in 10 attempts.

The second half was tepid although it was noteworthy for an international debut for Brentford forward Ivan Toney who came on 10 minutes from the end as a substitute for Kane.

Ukraine, who came agonisingly close to qualifying for the World Cup but lost a playoff to Wales, will be relieved to have got their toughest fixture out of the way.

There was plenty of sympathy for war-ravaged Ukraine around Wembley Stadium with 1,000 tickets donated to refugees and their sponsor families and the country's anthem warmly-applauded.

But all sentiment was put to one side once the whistle sounded with England focussed only on building on their first victory in 62 years against Italy on Italian soil.

It took them a while to get going, however, as Ukraine comfortably kept the hosts at bay for most of the first half.

Kane, who was presented with a golden boot beforehand, was missing two routine chances, first fluffing a close-range volley and then prodding an inviting James Maddison delivery over.

But when he got a third chance he made no mistake.

Having passed the ball out to Saka, the captain then ghosted into the area and was picked out by the Arsenal's man cross to touch the ball home. Saka then produced a goal of stunning quality, turning on to Jordan Henderson's pass and curling a shot into the top corner.

Ukraine, who had a couple of half chances early on, showed plenty of energy after the interval but did not have the quality to ruffle and England side in cruise control.

It could have been a bigger margin of victory if substitutes Conor Gallagher and Jack Grealish, left out in favour of Maddison, had converted chances, although by that time thousands of England fans had decided to get to the station early.

Ukraine's fans stayed until the end, however, and gave their team a rousing ovation in a corner that was a sea of yellow and blue. Their next game will be against North Macedonia in June while England are away in Malta next.

New research from the University of Wisconsin–Madison is helping to change that by identifying the cell population that causes GVHD, a target that may make bone marrow transplants safer and more effective.





An allogenic (from a donor) bone marrow transplant is a common treatment for blood cancers and other diseases of the immune system. During the transplant, the patient’s immune cells are replaced with the donor’s healthy cells. While the donor cells can help cure the patient’s blood cancer, they can also cause GVHD — in which donor T cells, a specialized immune cell in the blood, attack the patient’s healthy cells. This causes complications similar to an autoimmune disease that can be lethal.

“Graft versus host disease is one of the most common complications after an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation procedure, and the field knows quite well that the T cells from the donor are the ones mediating the disease,” says the study’s lead author Nicholas Hess, a scientist at UW–Madison’s Carbone Cancer Center. “Before this study, there was no finite T cell population that we've been able to identify as the cause of GVHD, so all our treatment regimens generally impacted the entire T cell population. But targeting all the T cells is not ideal, as they don't just cause this detrimental disease, they also have a beneficial impact on the ability to prevent relapses.”





In Science Advances, Hess and collaborators including Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine Center members Christian Capitini, professor of pediatrics, and Peiman Hematti, professor of medicine, published their findings, identifying cells called CD4/CD8 double positive T cells (DPT) causing GVHD in immunodeficient mice. To further confirm their findings, the researchers directly investigated human patient samples.





“We looked at over 400 clinical samples from 35 patients as a part of this study and found double positive T cells to be predictive of GVHD. We also found four other biomarkers which are predictive of not just GVHD, but also relapse in general,” says Hess. “Based on that, our next step is to merge the biomarkers into a machine learning algorithm that can output a risk prediction model. Clinicians could then use this model to understand a patient’s risk of relapse and GVHD.”





A team of physicians and scientists at UW–Madison is working on ways to address the problematic cells in patients while leaving healthy and helpful T cells to flourish. Hess says that while the team is very confident the double positive T cells are directly involved in GVHD, the key step in bringing this discovery to the clinic will be developing a targeted depletion strategy and this prediction model.





“When we can gain confidence in this biomarker research and our ability to identify patients at risk, then we will potentially be able to treat them before they have all the detrimental effects of this disease,” Hess says.





The study won a Best Abstracts Award from the American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy and was presented at the American Association of Immunologists (AAI) and ECOG-ACRIN conferences, creating excitement based on the findings’ potential impact beyond blood cancer and transplantation.





“I’ve learned that DPTs have been found in a variety of chronic human inflammatory diseases, which goes to show that this is not a specific thing to graft-versus-host disease. It's probably a wider phenomenon that these human T cells are doing that we've never really appreciated before,” says Hess. “It's very exciting because it gives us something to study further. I've always been interested in taking something you discover in the lab and translating it to the clinic. I think it's what gets me up every day. It is kind of the ultimate goal in my life to be able to say I participated in something that helped patients in some way.”

407,407,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-022-01037-8,"Rare diseases, common challenges","The genetics community has a particularly important part to play in accelerating rare disease research and contributing to improving diagnosis and treatment. Innovations in sequencing technology and machine learning approaches have positively affected diagnostic success, but more coordinated efforts are needed to move towards effective therapies or even cures for these important, and sometimes overlooked, class of diseases.

Rare Disease Day was recently held on 28 February 2022, which aimed to raise awareness and promote advocacy for rare disease research. Globally, there are more than 300 million people living with rare diseases and there are no approved therapies for over 90% of these disorders. Because around 80% of rare diseases have a genetic basis, recent advances in genomic sequencing technologies and molecular gene therapies have enhanced diagnosis and expanded treatments. To ensure that these advances are benefitting as many patients as possible and doing so in an equitable manner, unified efforts that span different stakeholders across rare disease communities should be supported.

In this issue of Nature Genetics, Halley and colleagues present a Comment that calls for an integrated approach for rare disease research in the United States. The authors argue that rare diseases are an important public health issue that should be given commensurate attention for their collective effects on individual patients, disease communities and healthcare systems. As such, the approach to rare disease research needs to broader for maximum benefits to a greater number of patients. The authors call for integrated approaches to research infrastructure that would minimize barriers to making connections, whether biological, therapeutic or societal, within and between rare diseases.

The authors highlight that rare disease research is currently very siloed and often organized around single disorders. Although efforts such as the Rare Disease Clinical Research Network have taken a broader approach, overall, there is limited coordination across rare disease research networks. The single-disorder focus creates challenges for jointly combining efforts, sharing data, assessing outcomes and capturing knowledge that could be relevant across diseases. A more integrated structure with appropriate support for researchers to coordinate across rare diseases would minimize redundant efforts and increase efficiency, potentially accelerating development and the implementation of successful therapies.

Importantly, no recommendations intended to promote rare disease research can ignore equity; indeed, ensuring fair practices in funding and equitable benefits of research outcomes must be a central focus of any research initiatives into rare diseases. It is challenging to achieve greater parity across rare diseases within the current research infrastructure, as analyzing how outcomes vary within or across rare diseases in different populations or socioeconomic groups is not straightforward. A more integrated approach to rare disease research will enable the assessment of how various factors (such as income level, insurance status, or racism in health care) affect participation in rare disease research or access to its benefits.

Altogether, the authors advocate for moving towards a more coordinated approach to rare disease research that would enable analysis of the similarities and differences across diseases in terms of etiology, treatment and outcomes. Although this article is specifically focused on the United States, the authors also recognize existing international efforts, such as the Global Genes and Genetic Alliance and the International Rare Disease Research Consortium that are leading the way in facilitating coordinated research efforts and data sharing.

We are excited by new technical advances in rare disease genetics research that apply the latest technologies to improve diagnosis. As an example, also in this issue of Nature Genetics, Hsieh and colleagues report a tool that uses deep convolutional neural networks to aid in diagnosing ultra-rare disorders based on facial morphology. GestaltMatcher defines a Clinical Face Phenotype Space based on over 17,000 photographs of patients representing more than 1,100 rare disorders. An advantage of using this method is that patients who share the same genetic diagnosis can be matched, even in cases when the disorder is not part of the training set. This helps with the clinical diagnosis of both known and new phenotypes. The concept of matching patients with rare disease is also conveyed on our cover, with actual matches forming the shape of a human face.","Rare Disease Day was recently held on 28 February 2022, which aimed to raise awareness and promote advocacy for rare disease research.

The American Heart Association journal Circulation: Genomic and Precision Medicine publication of a new scientific statement aims to inform patients and medical providers on what to do when a variation is found.

An American Heart Association scientific statement is an expert analysis of current research and may inform future guidelines. The new statement, “Interpreting Incidentally Identified Variants in Genes Associated with Heritable Cardiovascular Disease,” suggests next steps to determine whether a variant truly carries a health risk, provides support to healthcare professionals on how to communicate with people and their families and suggests appropriate follow-up actions to care for people with variants deemed higher risk for CVD.

Variants associated with cardiovascular disease risk are often found “incidentally” when people undergo genetic testing for non-cardiac reasons, including screening or diagnosis of other diseases. These unexpected genetic variants may also be discovered with genetic testing through direct-to-consumer DNA testing kits.

Pretest genetic counselling is strongly encouraged to prepare patients for the possibility of incidental findings, how and whether findings will be communicated, and potential implications for themselves and family members.

“The scope and use of genetic testing have expanded greatly in the past decade with the increasing ease and reduced cost of DNA sequencing,” said Andrew P Landstrom, MD., PhD, FAHA, chair of the scientific statement writing committee and associate professor of pediatrics and cell biology at Duke University School of Medicine in Durham, North Carolina. “Where we would once look for genetic changes in a handful of genes, we can now sequence every gene and, potentially, the whole genome, allowing us to make genetic diagnoses that would have been impossible in the past. However, with increased genetic testing comes more surprises, including finding unexpected variants in genes that might be associated with cardiovascular disease.

“If we interpret these incidental variants incorrectly, it may lead to inappropriate care, either by suggesting patients have a risk of cardiac disease when they do not, or by not providing care to those with increased risk for a serious condition.”

This statement is the first to focus on inherited monogenic, or single-gene, diseases for CVD which can be passed on within families, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or long QT syndrome. There are currently 42 clinically treatable, secondary variant genes that increase the risk of sickness or death from sudden cardiac death, heart failure and other types of cardiovascular disease, according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics. Genetic variants that cause long QT syndrome cause the heart to electrically reset slower than normal after each contraction, which may cause electrical instability of the heart and may lead to fainting, arrhythmias or even sudden death.

Once an incidental genetic variant for CVD is found, the statement authors suggest a framework for interpreting the variant and determining whether it is classified as benign, uncertain or pathogenic (disease-causing):

Health care professionals should only relay information to patients about incidentally identified variants if they are among the cardiovascular disease genes already known to be associated with CVD and if patients agreed during pretest genetic counseling to be informed about incidental findings.

Incidentally identified variants in genes with an uncertain association with CVD should not be reported.

If the discovered variant may increase the risk of CVD, a family history and medical evaluation by an expert health care professional are suggested, preferably a specialist working with or within a multidisciplinary team to address in the disease in question. The goal of this evaluation is to determine whether the individual has evidence of the disease, such as symptoms or relevant test results, or if there are any warning signs in the family history.

The genetic variant itself should be re-evaluated periodically by an expert or expert team to ensure whether the CVD link remains accurate. As knowledge about a variant evolves over time, its link to disease may be reclassified.

Finally, the medical evaluation and genetic re-evaluation should guide next steps, which may vary from dismissing the incidental variant as not likely to cause CVD to starting medical interventions. This may also involve periodic re-evaluation with appropriate tests (echocardiogram, blood tests, etc.) and possibly screening other family members for the variant.

“The list of incidental variants related to cardiovascular disease continues to evolve. This statement provides a foundation of care that may help people with a CVD-related genetic variant and their health care professionals take the next step in determining the individual and familial risk that a variant may or may not carry,” Landstrom said. “It’s also important to consult with genetics specialists to custom-tailor an evaluation and treatment plan to both the individual and the genetic variant in order to ensure the highest level of care possible.” (ANI)

Variants associated with cardiovascular disease risk are often found “incidentally” when people undergo genetic testing for non-cardiac reasons, including screening or diagnosis of other diseases.
These unexpected genetic variants may also be discovered with genetic testing through direct-to-consumer DNA testing kits.
However, with increased genetic testing comes more surprises, including finding unexpected variants in genes that might be associated with cardiovascular disease.

Wever co-founded the Second Chance 5K, which has since turned into a non-profit. Its mission is to give people another chance to find a cure for addiction.

“I felt like it was important for people who struggle with addiction to first feel like real people because they are. And for other people to recognize it. There’s been so much shame attached to this disease,” Wever said.

This is the seventh year Second Chance has been held, and Saturday’s race took place near Givens Elementary in Summerlin West. Participants were encouraged to arrive at 8 a.m. and the race’s program started at 9 a.m.

While folks were given the option to walk or run, some participants said they went to honor the lives lost.

“This is about people who are suffering, families who have suffered, people who know people that are going through it,” Michele Dearing said. “So, you’ve got to be a part of something bigger than yourself.”

There were non-profits at the event with booths, sharing information on how people battling addiction can lead a life toward recovery.

“It’s really meeting them where they’re at. Helping them figure out what are they willing to do right now to help them move out of the situation they’re in,” Angel Lash, coordinator for the Clark County District Court Law Enforcement Intervention for Mental Health and Addiction Program said.

The funds raised at the 5K went to organizations such as No Hero in Heroin, Vegas Stronger, and Mission High School, which is the first school in the country designed for students recovering from substance abuse.

The acute viral haemorrhagic illness belongs to the same family as Ebola and is named after the town of Lassa in northern Nigeria.

While the spread of any new disease can cause panic among people, knowing facts and spreading awareness can help take people informed decisions. Unlike Coronavirus, Lassa virus doesn't spread through everyday contact like hugging or shaking hands. It can spread only if one comes in contact with a contaminated rodent's urine or excrement. It can also infect a person if he or she is exposed to blood, urine, feces, or other bodily secretions of an infected person.

Is Lassa fever spreading in India?

Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Benin, Ghana, and Mali are among the countries in West Africa where Lassa fever is endemic. Within the United States, the prevalence of Lassa virus infections varies. The disease is most common in West Africa's forested regions, where Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone share a border.

Among India, incidences of Lassa disease have been reported in returned travelers. However, there is no information on the disease's prevalence in India.

Symptoms of Lassa fever

""Lassa fever is accompanied with a wide range of clinical symptoms and its incubation period is between one to three weeks. Prior to the start of symptoms, Lassa fever patients are not thought to be contagious. The majority of infected people experience moderate symptoms (about 80%), such as a low-grade fever, lethargy, and headache, and may not seek medical care,"" says Dr. Manish Wadhwani, Consultant Intensivist, Masina Hospital.

""In about 20% of people, the disease progresses to more serious signs and symptoms, including pharyngitis, cough, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea. Muscle discomfort, chest pain, back pain, and stomach pain are all common symptoms. In severe cases, face swelling, respiratory failure, fits, unconsciousness, bleeding (from the mouth, nose, vaginal, or gastrointestinal tract), and a reduction in blood pressure can occur, leading to multi-system involvement and subsequent crucial organ failure,"" adds Dr Wadhwani.

Lassa fever complications

Hearing loss is the most prevalent Lassa fever complication, which affects up to one-third of patients and can occur with mild or severe illness. In around half of the instances, hearing may improve after 1-3 months.

""Vomiting, sore throat, breathing trouble, blood, and diarrhoea are all poor prognosis indicators. In serious situations, death usually occurs within two weeks of the onset of symptoms. Lassa virus is found in about 1% of the population. Infections cause death, with fatality rates ranging from 15 to 30% among hospitalised patients,"" says the expert.

Lassa fever treatment

Ribavirin, an antiviral medication, is used to treat Lassa fever. Ribavirin is most effective when used within the first six days of a fever's start. Apart from ribavirin, supportive care includes things like keeping blood pressure under control with appropriate fluids and maintaining oxygen levels with external oxygen support.

How to prevent Lassa fever

Residents and visitors to places where Mastomys rats are common should keep food in rodent-proof containers, capture rodents in and around their homes, and avoid eating rodents.

Patients with known or suspected Lassa fever should be handled in healthcare to reduce person-to-person contact.

To reduce the danger of person-to-person transmission, community-based care should be avoided if possible. Even if the clinical indications are minor, patients with signs and symptoms of illness should be considered contagious. Lassa fever does not have a vaccination available to prevent it.

Their findings are published in the journal Alzheimer’s and Dementia in a paper titled, “The P522R protective variant of PLCG2 promotes the expression of antigen presentation genes by human microglia in an Alzheimer’s disease mouse model.”

“The P522R variant of PLCG2, expressed by microglia, is associated with reduced risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD),” wrote the researchers. “Yet, the impact of this protective mutation on microglial responses to AD pathology remains unknown.”

“Recently the mutation, which is known as P522R, was shown to lower the risk of developing late-onset Alzheimer’s,” explained Hayk Davtyan, PhD, senior researcher in the laboratory of Mathew Blurton-Jones, professor of neurobiology & behavior, where the study was conducted. The project was led by assistant project scientist Christel Claes, PhD, the paper’s first author.

The researchers used CRISPR gene-editing technology to generate the protective mutation in human stem cells and then implanted microglia derived from those stem cells into humanized rodent models of Alzheimer’s disease.

“Our research showed for the first time that the P522R variant increased expression levels of several microglial genes that are reduced in people with Alzheimer’s. This provides some of the first evidence to explain how this protective mutation might reduce Alzheimer’s risk,” Davtyan noted.

The researchers also observed the variant increased the number of T cells in the brain.

“Beyond that, the next step could be to identify drugs that can safely increase the activity of the PLCG2 enzyme and further promote protective microglial functions. It is well known that the PLCG2 P522R mutation increases TREM2 downstream signaling, an AD risk variant, thus it will be very interesting to study the effect of TREM2 stimulating antibodies on microglia-T cell crosstalk. Studies like ours pave the way to find new strategies to treat or prevent this disease that is taking such a toll on humanity, this is what drives us as neuroscientists,” said Davtyan.","Researchers at the University of California, Irvine, have discovered how a gene mutation in brain immune cells serves a positive role in protecting people against Alzheimer’s disease in mice.

Mason Greenwood ‘would run through a brick wall to be back playing’ at Man Utd as a report highlights the ‘back story’ of his time at Old Trafford after criminal charges against the forward were dropped.

Greenwood, 21, had been facing charges including attempted rape and assault but the Crown Prosecution Service announced at the beginning of February the case had been discontinued as “the withdrawal of key witnesses and new material that came to light meant there was no longer a realistic prospect of conviction”.

Man Utd then issued their own statement which said “the club will now conduct its own process before determining next steps”.

Greenwood, who has two and a half years left on his contract, has been suspended from both training and playing for the club since his arrest in January 2022.

And, as United’s internal investigation continues, The Athletic‘s Laurie Whitwell has put together the ‘back story’ of Greenwood’s time at the Premier League club, where the England international has been since the age of six.

One source told The Athletic that the process and investigation has ‘changed’ Greenwood for good, claiming: “He would run through a brick wall to be back playing for United now.”

A representative told the website that Greenwood should be able to resume his duties at Man Utd, they said: “There’s no real substance to any of this, it being a mix of old news, speculation, half-truths and completely untrue claims. Mason is 21, he has been cleared and should be allowed the opportunity to rebuild and move forward with his young life.”

Greenwood has always been confident in his own ability but it has apparently extended too far at times with the Man Utd star calling out other players for being “sh*t”.

Whitwell wrote:

‘Greenwood’s confidence had been established in his early days at United’s academy. At the age of 16, he could be brutal with his choice of words when dismissing the credentials of boys not on his level; something not uncommon among talented players in youth teams. ‘Someone who witnessed events, says: “He knew he was a good player and was cutting, he wasn’t shy about telling someone they were sh*t. When you hear that you’d think, ‘Can’t be talking like that’.” ‘But, then again, Greenwood levelled the same criticism at Cristiano Ronaldo when he was still at Real Madrid. “He’s dead,” Greenwood once said — implying he was finished in teenage vernacular. Staff corrected him and considered his mentality that of youthful delusion.’

Story continues

The report does add that Greenwood has now ‘demonstrated signs of becoming more mature around Carrington, asking how people were doing when he hadn’t shown great interest in that kind of conversation before’.

The United States Justice Department has announced charges against a second man it accuses of being involved in the assassination of Haitian President Jovenel Moise last year.

Rodolphe Jaar, 49, a dual Haitian-Chilean citizen, was charged with conspiring to commit murder or kidnapping outside of the US, the Justice Department said on Thursday.

He was also charged with “providing material support resulting in death, knowing or intending that such material support would be used to prepare for or carry out the conspiracy to kill or kidnap” in relation to Moise’s killing at his residence in Port-au-Prince on July 7, 2021.

Jaar is the second person to be charged in the US this month over the assassination, after authorities charged a former member of the Colombian military, Mario Antonio Palacios, with “conspiracy to commit murder or kidnapping outside the US” on January 4.

US authorities said Palacios was part of a plan to kidnap Moise that later evolved into an assassination plot after the conspirators were unable to find a plane to take the president out of Haiti.

More than 40 people have been arrested so far in Haiti, the US and Jamaica in connection with Moise’s killing, which heightened uncertainty in a nation already struggling with widespread poverty, natural disasters and political instability.

Powerful armed gangs have tightened their grip on the country since the president’s assassination, causing a spike in violence and kidnappings.

In its statement on Thursday, the US Justice Department accused Jaar of being among a group of co-conspirators – including about 20 Colombian citizens and several dual Haitian-American nationals – who “entered President Moise’s residence in Haiti with the intent and purpose of killing him”.

“Jaar was responsible for providing weapons to the Colombian co-conspirators to facilitate carrying out the operation; several of the Colombian co-conspirators also stayed at a residence controlled by Jaar,” the department said.

The US complaint, which was unsealed on Wednesday in the US District Court for the Southern District of Florida, also accused Jaar of being present when an unnamed co-conspirator obtained a signature from a former Haitian judge on a request for assistance to arrest and imprison Moise.

The unnamed co-conspirator, referred to only as “co-conspirator #1”, is described as a dual Haitian-American who travelled from Haiti to the US to help lay the groundwork for the plan before flying back to Haiti from Florida on July 1, 2021, to participate in the operation.

The person is currently in custody in Haiti, the complaint says.

Jaar voluntarily consented to an interview with FBI agents on December 9, 2021, the complaint states, and an FBI agent said in a sworn statement that he “admitted that he provided firearms and ammunition to the Colombians to support the assassination operation”.

“He stated that the operation changed from an arrest operation to an assassination operation after the initial plan to ‘capture’ the Haitian President at the airport and take him away by plane did not go forward.”

Jaar was convicted of drug-trafficking charges a decade ago and once served as an informant for the US government.","Dual Haitian-Chilean citizen is second man charged in the US over plot to assassinate Jovenel Moise in July last year.

It has been driven by increased consumption of energy dense and ultra-processed foods as well as sugar sweetened beverages coupled with sedentariness and decreased energy expenditure. The World Heart Federation (WHF) estimates that 2.3 million children and adults are at present overweight or obese the world over, with a projected rise to 2.5 billion by 2025.

The conventional measure of being overweight and obese is the body mass index (BMI) which relates weight to height through a metric which reads BMI = weight (in Kilograms)/height (in metres) squared. The standard globally applied definition of overweight is a BMI of 25-<30 and of obesity 30 or above. A BMI lower than 18.5 is classified as underweight. These cut-offs are considered generally to be predictive of healthy life expectancy in the ‘normal’ range between 18.5 and 24.9. Being overweight and obesity are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, some cancers, osteoarthritis, liver, gallbladder and respiratory problems.

BMI DOES NOT FACTOR IN RACE DIFFERENCES

However, these ‘universal’ cut-offs, which were developed in Caucasian populations, proved to be inappropriate for other populations. Recognising that Asian populations manifested a rising risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease at lower levels of BMI, the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommended that public health and clinical action thresholds should be reset for those populations at BMIs 23 and 27.5, with the ideal range being between 18.5 and 23. While these are interpreted as Asian cut-offs for defining overweight and obesity respectively, international comparisons across all countries mostly use cut-offs of 25 and 30. Lower BMI cut-offs are being recommended for Black African and Black Caribbean populations too.

The problem with BMI is that it does not differentiate between weight contributed by fat, muscle and bone. A very muscular individual may have a BMI over 30, inviting the label of being obese, even if the body fat content is not high. Similarly, a person with low muscle mass or low bone weight may have a BMI of 22 but still be at a high risk of diabetes, hypertension and heart attacks. While BMI broadly correlates with the prevalence of cardio-metabolic diseases at the population level, it does not distinguish well at the individual level.

This problem of misclassification of risk has been particularly prominent in South Asians of the Indian sub-continent. It was initially noted among Indian migrants studied in different continents. Their increased propensity for diabetes and excess risk of heart attacks was not explained by a high BMI, as many had values within the ’normal’ range. They, however, had high amounts of body fat, especially concentrated around the abdominal organs. Such ‘visceral adiposity’ or ‘abdominal obesity’ poses a high risk of diabetes and heart disease. Some international algorithms for predicting the risk of a future cardiovascular event now use ‘South Asian ethnicity’ as an independent risk marker.

THE WAIST TO HEIGHT RATIO HOLDS GOOD FOR ALL RACES

These findings have also been corroborated by several studies of Indians residing in different parts of India. More than BMI, the waist to hip ratio (WHR) has emerged as a better predictor of diabetes and cardiovascular disease than BMI. This index, which compares the waist circumference to that around the hips, measures the degree of abdominal obesity. Since it is not always easy to measure the hip circumference, especially when clothing is interposed between the tape and the body, an alternate measure has emerged in recent years. This is the waist to height ratio (both expressed in centimetres). This ratio has been shown to be a very good predictor of cardio-metabolic risk, certainly better than BMI and in some studies even better than WHR. Initially developed, validated and applied in children, it is being increasingly used in adults.

In December 2022, UK’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommended that waist-to-height ratio be used instead of BMI. A ratio higher than 0.5 carries an increased risk of cardio-metabolic disease. This relationship does not appear to be altered by differences in race, age or gender.

UNDERSTANDING THE OBESITY PARADOX

One of the consequences of using a flawed measure like BMI has been the reporting of an ‘obesity paradox’ where obesity appeared to be protective in some health conditions. It was reported that it may protect against deaths from heart failure, stroke and diabetes. These studies have been criticised on the ground that the contributions of body fat, muscle, bone and fluids to the excess weight have not been assessed. Similarly, the high prevalence of ‘thin diabetes’ in India will appear puzzling if the body fat content and visceral adiposity are not taken into account.

A recent study, however, showed that the fallacy around ‘protective obesity’ arose because BMI was measuring body weight rather than body fat, which is mainly responsible for inflammation and disease. Published on March 22, in the ‘European Heart Journal,’ the study looked at the clinical outcomes in persons with chronic heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (pumping ability) of the heart. Scientists analysed data from 6,567 men and 1,832 women participating in the PARADIGM-HF heart failure trial, which was conducted in 47 countries. While unadjusted BMI-based analysis appeared to support the idea of the ‘obesity paradox’, analysis with adjustment for other variables removed that effect. More important, the use of waist to height ratio showed a positive correlation with higher mortality risk.

Fluid retention occurs in heart failure, adding to body weight but not reflecting the adipose tissue content of the body. Waist to height ratio is unaffected by that altered weight. After adjustment, both BMI and waist-to-height ratio showed that higher levels were associated with a greater risk of death or hospitalisation for heart failure, but this was more evident for the waist-to-height ratio.

WAIST TO HEIGHT (WHtR) RATIO OVER 0.5 = BELLY FAT

Race or ethnicity related differences in BMI’s gradient of cardio-metabolic risk have implications for screening of persons at high risk in a population. A recent study, published on March 24, in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, examined the impact of racial differences on population screening for diabetes in the US. The existing guidelines of US Preventive Services Task Force (USPTF) recommend screening for pre-diabetes and diabetes in people aged 35-70 years, if they are overweight or obese by conventional BMI standards.

The authors of the new study reported that such screening underestimated the numbers with diabetes or pre-diabetes in Asian, Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black adults. The percentage of cases identified among persons of Asian ethnicity was significantly lower among the Asians residing in America, compared to other racial groups, when the age cum BMI criteria were used, compared to measured blood glucose values. They recommend that the BMI based screening criteria be dropped and all adults in the age group of 35-70 be screened. Matthew O’Brien, lead author of the study avers that such a revised strategy would promote greater health equity, by reducing the effect of racial differences. Perhaps the USPTF should look at waist-to-height ratio too!

From this welter of information, a clear message emerges for us to use in India. Waist to height ratio over 0.5 = visceral adiposity = raised risk of obesity related diseases. Works for children, women and men.

(Prof K. Srinath Reddy is a cardiologist, epidemiologist and Distinguished Professor of Public Health, PHFI)","The conventional measure of being overweight and obese is the body mass index (BMI) which relates weight to height through a metric which reads BMI = weight (in Kilograms)/height (in metres) squared.
More than BMI, the waist to hip ratio (WHR) has emerged as a better predictor of diabetes and cardiovascular disease than BMI.
A recent study, however, showed that the fallacy around ‘protective obesity’ arose because BMI was measuring body weight rather than body fat, which is mainly responsible for inflammation and disease.

(Feb. 23, 2022) — Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers from the University of Kentucky’s College of Medicine and College of Engineering have joined forces to track the virus’ presence in the community using wastewater testing.

In addition to providing local disease surveillance, the collaboration across disciplines has generated $4.7 million in external federal funding to support two research projects involving the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater.

Led by Assistant Professor of Family and Community Medicine James Keck, M.D., and Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering Scott Berry, Ph.D., the two projects are aimed at exploring wastewater testing’s impact on COVID-19 public health measures and advancing testing technology.

Wastewater surveillance provides an alternative strategy for SARS-CoV-2 detection in communities by evaluating samples of wastewater for the presence of viral biomarkers like RNA. Wastewater includes water from household and building use that can contain human fecal waste, which can be tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.

The practice has seen limited use in the past as a public health surveillance tool, but the COVID-19 pandemic has brought newfound interest in the approach due to its ability to monitor infection trends without extensive clinical testing, says Keck.

“The investment in advancing wastewater testing is a reflection of the usefulness of this tool to give a comprehensive picture of the spread of infection, especially in rural communities with limited access to clinical testing,” Keck said.

The team’s first project, supported by an 18-month $1.3 million grant from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is focused on testing wastewater for the early detection of COVID-19 in nursing homes.

The team has been testing wastewater daily at six nursing homes in the Lexington and Louisville areas using an automated sampling device in facility sewers. If a sample tests positive for SARS-CoV-2, facilities are notified and can then take additional measures to prevent infection spread including facility-wide clinical testing.

Keck says results will help inform public health officials about how testing can be used as another measure to control the spread of disease in congregate living settings, including long-term care facilities.

“Since wastewater testing can show the first signs of an outbreak in a community prior to detection in clinical samples, the early notice could help prevent COVID-19 infections and deaths in this vulnerable population,” Keck said.

The second project, supported by a $3.4 million grant from the National Institutes of Health, is aimed at advancing the testing technology so that samples can be processed and analyzed on-site.

During conventional wastewater testing, samples must be sent to a lab after they are collected so they can go through a complicated series of steps needed to extract the RNA before a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test can be done.

Berry invented a new technology called exclusion-based sample preparation (ESP), which uses special beads to extract the RNA to make the process faster and more efficient.

“ESP can provide a fast and simple method to manipulate RNA and has the potential to improve testing sensitivity and help to create a low-cost way to expand testing in rural areas or developing countries,” said Berry. “RNA also degrades over time, so the faster samples can be tested, the more accurate the results.”

With the help of engineering students, Berry and his team created a mobile lab to take wastewater testing to rural Kentucky. Equipped with ESP and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), the “Disease Detective” van has the capability to both process and analyze samples in the field.

Beginning this summer, the van will head to rural communities in Kentucky where Berry’s team will train people to test wastewater at treatment plants, schools and streams.

In the meantime, Berry's lab is processing weekly samples from wastewater treatment plants across eight counties in Kentucky. Results are being used by local health officials to evaluate response measures that were taken due to the spread of infection. The hope is that the ESP technology will eventually allow the wastewater treatment plant operators to do the testing themselves, Berry says.

In addition to the training, the team partners with UK’s College of Education on another project that will utilize the mobile lab to teach local students about wastewater testing and get them excited about science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM).

It’s just another way the project has connected researchers from different disciplines who otherwise may never have worked together, says Keck.

“Basic science researchers and engineers are working with public health officials to have real impact in communities across Kentucky,” said Keck. “These projects utilize expertise and resources across many disciplines, bringing UK’s mission as a land grant institution into service.”

At a Glance People who used electronic cigarettes had unique microbial communities in their mouths that more closely resembled those of smokers than of nonsmokers.

These communities may signal an increased risk of gum disease for those who use e-cigarettes.

The use of electronic cigarettes—also called vaping—has been on the rise. In 2019, almost 5% of adults in the U.S reported using e-cigarettes. Overall, e-cigarettes are thought to produce fewer toxic compounds than conventional cigarettes, but they can still contain many harmful substances, including nicotine and heavy metals like lead.

Smoking conventional cigarettes is a known risk factor for the development of gum disease, or periodontitis. Part of this risk is driven by changes in the bacterial communities that normally live in the mouth, called the oral microbiome. But whether e-cigarettes induce similar changes hasn’t been well understood.

To look at this issue, a team led by Drs. Deepak Saxena and Xin Li from New York University examined 84 volunteers over a six-month period: 27 people who smoked conventional cigarettes, 28 who only used e-cigarettes, and 29 nonsmokers. All participants had at least mild gum disease at the start of the study. To reduce other factors that could affect the oral microbiome, none had their teeth cleaned during the study period.

The team compared the types of bacteria found where the gums meet the teeth at the beginning and end of the six-month study. They also compared markers of inflammation and immune cell activity. The study was funded in part by NIH’s National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR). Results appeared on February 22, 2022, in mBio.

The number of unique bacterial species—a measure called alpha diversity—living in and around the gums increased for all participants during the study. This can be a sign of gum disease getting worse.

The specific types of microbes found in the oral microbiomes differed substantially between the three groups. There was a core set of species common among the groups, but each also had unique features. They were so distinct that a machine-learning program could use the oral microbiome to predict which group people were in with 74% accuracy.

However, the program was least accurate at picking out e-cigarette users. The patterns of their oral microbes shared characteristics with both smokers and nonsmokers, with slightly more similarities to smokers. Unique traits among e-cigarette users included enrichment with Fusobacterium and Bacteroidales species. Both of these are linked with gum disease.

Several markers of inflammation and immune response were also higher in smokers and e-cigarette users than in nonsmokers. But again, these patterns differed between smokers and e-cigarette users.

“We are now beginning to understand how e-cigarettes and the chemicals they contain are changing the oral microbiome and disrupting the balance of bacteria,” Saxena says.

More work will be needed to better understand how e-cigarette use alters the oral microbiome and potentially affects gum health and disease.

The number of people on cardiac waiting lists grew to 293,500 people at the end of January, NHS England data shows. This is nearly 2,700 more than the previous month, and the 19th consecutive month where an increase has been seen.

The data also shows:

4025 people were waiting over a year in January – 144 times higher than before the pandemic began when just 28 people were waiting this long

Just over 100 people have been waiting over two years

Nearly 30 per cent of people on waiting lists for potentially lifesaving heart care in England have been waiting over four months (18 weeks)

Data includes emergency, urgent, and elective, or ‘routine,’ heart surgery and other heart procedures, such as stents or balloons to open narrow or blocked arteries.

Commenting on the figures, Dr Sonya Babu-Narayan, our associate medical director and a consultant cardiologist said:



“Month after month, we see waiting lists for time-critical heart care grow by the thousands with no sign of improving. But cardiac care can’t wait – significant delays could lead to more avoidable heart attacks, disabling heart failure, or even premature deaths.



“The vast and mounting backlog of cardiac care is a ticking time bomb, which the health secretary recognised earlier this week. But what patients still urgently need to see is a clearly funded and specific plan to address the burden of cardiovascular disease. Heart patients’ lives are at risk, and we must urgently start to address the shortage of heart disease doctors, nurses and physiologists.”

The virus causes a severe hemorrhagic fever and is deadlier than the related Ebola virus, which was first suspected in the deaths. Tanzanian health officials say they are working to contain the Marburg outbreak.

Tanzania’s health minister, Ummy Mwalimu, said the mysterious and deadly outbreak in its northwest Kagera region was caused by the Marburg virus.

Mwalimu announced at a Tuesday evening press briefing the government was intensifying efforts to contain the virus, including with contact tracing.

She said among the five people who died from the virus last week were four from the same family. The additional death was a health worker.

Mwalimu said the government has successfully managed to control the rate of new infections of the disease and the disease remains confined to the same area.

Tanzania has never before recorded a case of Marburg, a virus that the World Health Organization says has a fatality rate as high as 88%.

The deaths last week were initially suspected to be Ebola, a virus related to Marburg that the WHO says has an average fatality rate of 50% but is slightly more infectious.

Marburg and Ebola have similar symptoms, such as high fever, severe headaches, and bleeding.

Last week’s outbreak occurred near the border with Uganda, which recovered from a months-long Ebola outbreak in January that caused 77 deaths.

WHO Regional Director for Africa Matshidiso Moeti said Tuesday officials were working with Tanzania to halt the Marburg virus’s spread.

WHO Tanzania representative Zabulon Yoti told the Tuesday briefing the public should remain calm as it deals with the disease.

“This is not the first time Marburg has occurred in Africa. It has happened several times in our neighboring country, Uganda, and they have typically managed to contain it through strong community involvement,"" said Yoti. ""I am calling upon community members to join hands with the government to ensure that contacts are identified and those who require care receive it promptly.”

The WHO says Marburg has also been found in Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, and South Africa and is spread by bats to people, who then spread it through body fluids.

It was first recognized as a disease after simultaneous laboratory-related outbreaks in 1967 in the cities of Marburg and Frankfurt, Germany, and in Belgrade.

A WHO report last year said Tanzania is at high risk for infectious disease outbreaks.

Peter Bujari, who heads Health Promotion Tanzania, an activist group that raises awareness on health issues and disease control, said Marburg kills quickly and Tanzania’s health facilities often suffer from a shortage of medicine and medical supplies. Bujari said the government must aid healthcare workers who are on the front line in treating patients and receiving them, so they are not infected.

Clinically, AD patients present amnestic multidomain progressive dementia. A more definitive AD diagnosis requires evidence of amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques and Tau neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) accumulation within the neurodegenerative brain [3].

AD is a highly complex and heterogeneous disease caused by various pathophysiologic mechanisms. AD can be classified by heritable cause and age of onset, i.e., rare familial AD, sporadic early-onset (EOAD), and late-onset (LOAD) [4]. While AD often progresses through a period of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), not all patients with MCI develop AD, hinting at protective or causal factors that may differentially affect subsets of patients even within traditional subtypes. Postmortem evaluations revealed that AD brains may include depositions of additional pathologies (i.e., beyond Aβ and phosphorylated tau), such as Lewy bodies, alpha-synuclein, transactive response DNA-binding protein and/or vascular-related brain lesions [5]. Further, the recently discovered five molecular subtypes of AD were associated with unique molecular signatures and distinct sets of brain cell type-specific key regulators [6].

Understanding the cell-type-specific changes and regulations at the single-cell level will enable us to decode the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathophysiologic processes contributing to dementia. Indeed, recent single-cell sequencing studies of aged and AD brains revealed a series of brain cell clusters involved in AD [7, 8]. However, these studies primarily focused on clustering and differential analyses but did not fully exploit the single-cell sequencing data to explore, for example, pseudo-temporal dynamics. To mitigate these gaps, we reviewed the state-of-the-art bioinformatics approaches to analyze single-cell transcriptome (single-cell/−nuclei RNA sequencing (sc/snRNA-seq)) and epigenome (single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatic sequencing (scATAC-seq)) in AD, and integrate single-cell features with abundantly available AD bulk sequencing data. Specifically, we reviewed the following 15 topics (Fig. 1): 1) quality control and normalization, 2) dimension reduction and feature extraction, 3) cell clustering analysis, 4) cell type inference and annotation, 5) differential expression for disease gene identification, 6) trajectory inference, 7) copy number variation (CNV) analysis, 8) integration of single-cell multi-omics (e.g., expression associated quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and expression associated CNVs (eCNVs)), 9) epigenomic (scATAC-seq) analysis, 10) gene network inference, 11) prioritization of cell clusters, 12) integration of single cell and bulk RNA-seq data, 13) spatial single-cell transcriptomics, and 14) comparison between single cell AD mouse model studies and single cell human AD studies. For future directions, we discuss experimental validation strategies of single-cell based findings, and translations to drug discoveries. Notably, we implemented our recommended workflow for each major analytic direction and applied them to a large snRNA-seq dataset in AD. Key analytic results were reported while the scripts and the data were shared with the research community through GitHub (see the section ""Availability of data and software code"" for the details). We hope that the guidelines will accelerate AD research by leveraging the power of single-cell sequencing.

Fig. 1 Overview of the bioinformatics approaches to analyze scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq, and spatial transcriptomics data with a focus on scRNA-seq data. scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data (A) go through appropriate quality control (QC) to remove outliers and cells with low-quality sequencing data (B), followed by normalization (B). QC-ed and normalized data are then used for dimension reduction, and feature extraction (C) clustering analysis to identify cell clusters (D). Marker genes for each cell cluster will then be identified to infer its association to known or novel cell type (E). Meanwhile, differential gene expression is performed between cell groups of interest (e.g., AD and Control) in each cell cluster to identify gene expression changes associated with the disease (F). Trajectory inference can be performed on all cells, cells in each cluster or the cells from multiple closely related cell clusters to infer cellular dynamics during developmental or disease progression (G). Copy number variations (CNVs) can also be inferred from scRNA-seq data (H). Integration of gene expression and genomic (SNPs & CNVs) data leads to the identification of expression-associated quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) (I). Epigenomic analysis by scATAC-seq can study gene expression regulatory elements in open chromatin regions (J) and will be detailed in Fig. 7. Gene coexpression and causal networks will be constructed for each cell cluster or multiple closely related cell clusters, while priors from eQTLs and epigenomic analyses can be developed for assisting causal network inference (K). Cell clusters can be prioritized based on the number of differentially expressed genes between disease and control across all cell clusters (L). scRNA-seq data can also be integrated with bulk RNA-seq data to robustly identify key molecular changes and network structures (M). Finally, cell cluster-based networks will be analyzed to prioritize key subnetworks (e.g., coexpressed gene modules) and potential network regulators for a disease (e.g., AD) under study (N). Novel cell clusters, key subnetworks and key driver genes can be validated through single-cell spatial transcriptomics analysis which offers more insights into spatially distributed molecular signals in a system or a disease under study (O). Key findings from human AD single cell sequencing data will be validated in AD mouse models and integration of mouse and human single cell data is critical for informing the correspondence between AD mouse models and human AD (P) Full size image

Overview of single-cell sequencing study design

High-throughput sequencing of bulk tissue measures the average signals of various cell types, thus falls short of dissecting the cellular heterogeneity in brain tissues. To address this issue, single-cell sequencing has been recently developed to elucidate the cell-type specificity and identify the transcriptome, epigenome, and genome changes among various cellular populations. Recently, scRNA-seq studies have been widely conducted in many research fields, such as oncology [9], developmental biology [10], immunology [11], and neurosciences [12]. Several protocols have been developed to measure mRNAs and non-coding RNAs from single cells, such as Smart-seq [13], Quartz-seq [14], CEL-seq [15], RamDa-seq [16], Drop-seq [17], sci-RNA-seq [18] and Chromium (10X Genomics).

Single-cell genome and epigenome including single-cell ChIP-seq [19] and scATAC-seq have also emerged to investigate the genomic and epigenomic status associated with the transcriptome of cells [20, 21]. Single-cell genome sequencing captures de novo germline mutations, somatic mutations, and copy number alterations to dissect the genetic heterogeneity at the cellular level [22]. scATAC-seq is useful in analyzing the patterns of open chromatin, a hallmark of active regulatory elements, in single cells. Moreover, several advanced spatial sequencing techniques (for example, 10x Visium) have included spatial dimensions of the molecular features at a near-cellular resolution [23, 24]. Although the sequencing protocols have improved platforms and reagent kits to increase the detection sensitivity, the sequencing coverage is still limited, and present challenges to robustly analyzing single-cell sequencing data.

Several considerations should be taken into account for designing single-cell sequencing studies. The first one is tissue requirement. For example, whole single-cell RNA sequencing requires fresh samples, thus requiring the study to implement a seamless process from obtaining patients’ consent, acquiring the autopsy samples, to preparing a single-cell library even sequencing within a few hours [7, 25]. On the contrary, fresh frozen samples in a tissue repository can be preserved for a substantial amount of time, providing the freedom to select samples with relevant clinical, molecular characteristics such as gender and APOE genotype, and their nuclei can be isolated for snRNA-seq data analysis. The second consideration is cellular coverage. Several cell types, especially neurons, are underrepresented in scRNA-seq dataset, due to technical issues relating to size selection during the tissue dissociation process [26, 27], while snRNA-seq covers more cell types [28, 29]. However, in selecting single-cell or single-nuclei based approaches for transcriptomic profiling, it is important to recognize that each has its strengths and limitations. Brakken et al. compared these two approaches side by side by generating matched datasets from the mouse visual cortex [30]. They found that scRNA-seq analysis has the strengths of unbiased transcriptomic profiling, a higher gene coverage rate, and a higher-power for distinguishing similar cell types. However, the tissue dissociation and cell-isolation protocols are too harsh for certain cell types, leading to significant under-representation. In contrast, snRNA-seq has the strengths of less biased cellular coverage, resistance to cell isolation-associated perturbations, and applicability to both fresh and archived frozen specimens. Single-nuclei detected transcripts are also enriched for intronic reads, whereas the majority of the single-cell detected transcripts are from exons. Interestingly, the nuclear proportion of total cellular mRNA varies significantly in a cell-type and cortical-layer-specific manner, although the biological significance of such variation is still unknown. However, Thrupp et al. [31] found that snRNA-seq data is depleted of an activated microglial subpopulation expressing the activation signature, including APOE, CST3, SPP1 and CD74, but the absence of the microglial subpopulation was likely due to the low sequencing depth. Despite these differences, it is important to note that the overall cell-type landscapes captured by these two approaches are similar [30]. Power analysis is a critical step to rationalize scRNA-seq study design to ensure robustness and reproducibility of scientific findings. In the companion GitHub repository (see the section ""Availability of data and software code"" for details), we provided a comprehensive review of the power analysis approaches for single cell studies and shared the script for applying a recommended approach to an AD snRNA-seq study.

Different sequencing protocols are optimized for different biological aspects. PCR plate-based sequencing protocols (e.g. Smartseq2 [32], CEL-seq [15], and MARS-seq [33]) capture cells through cell sorter or microfluidics and offer high read depth per cell with less effective cell captures [34]. Thus, these protocols provide high sensitivity to discriminate subpopulations of similar cell types with subtle differences [35]. On the contrary, droplet-based protocols (e.g. InDrop [36], Drop-seq [17], and 10x Chromium [37]) capture thousands to millions of cells with low sequencing depths per cell [34], and can offer exogenous spike-ins to handle technical noises systematically [38, 39]. Large numbers of cells in these protocols enable the detection of rare cell populations such as neuronal subtypes [40]. However, Alsema et al. 2020 report that single-cell sequencing of FACS sorted microglia by droplet-based 10x Chromium and PCR plate-based Smart-seq2 only displayed marginal differences, most likely arising from technical noises by plate-based protocols [25]. These indicate targeted studies for cell type of interest may not require large-sequencing depths to uncover distinct sub-populations. So far, the droplet-based 10x Chromium snRNA-seq, which can sequence over 10,000 nuclei per library, is the most widely used sequencing platform for human cohort studies including AD (Table 1).

Quality control and normalization

Data quality control (QC) and normalization are the essential steps to remove systematic sources of technical variations introduced during the single-cell data generation process while preserving the true biological variations. Due to the low amount of RNA in a single cell and the stochastic sampling process of sequencing, scRNA-seq data are much noisier than bulk-tissue sequencing data [46, 47]. Excessive zero or near-zero counts by the so-called “dropout” events [48], often lead to highly sparse data, shadow the biological variations in individual cells and require dedicated QC metrics to ensure that only high-quality data are selected for downstream analysis. Starting from a count matrix of unique molecular identifiers (UMIs), a typical data preprocessing workflow generally contains several steps for QC to remove low-quality cells and genes, and normalize cell-specific biases.

Quality control on the cells

Two common quality measures are the number of expressed features (i.e., features detected with non-zero counts) and the library size (i.e., the sum of counts across all features). Violin plots are used to visualize the distribution of these cell-specific measures in each donor sample [49, 50]. Cells with very few expressed features or small library size indicate low RNA-capture efficiency and are hence considered poor quality. On the other hand, cells with abnormally a large number of expressed features suggest doublets or multiplets (i.e., two or more cells mistakenly captured as a single cell) [51], hypothesizing that doublets or multiplets would have higher total RNA content (see below for a review of more elegant doublet detection methods). Thus, a lower and an upper bound for the number of expressed features can be specified for cell filtering. However, determining the bounds for the number of expressed features or library size is not trivial as both biological and technical factors need be taken into account. For example, sequencing with deeper depth leads to more reads and more expressed features, irrespective of the cell quality. Another filtering approach is to detect outliers. For instance, it has been proposed to remove cells with log-library size greater than 3 median absolute deviations (MADs) or below the median log-library size [52, 53].

The presence of doublets or multilets may severely confound the downstream analysis and interpretation. This can lead to, for example, spurious cell clusters, both false positive and false negative prediction of cell cluster markers or disease genes, biased cell-state trajectories, and misrepresented gene-gene correlation structure and gene regulatory networks [54,55,56]. Doublet detection can be facilitated through appropriate experimental design. These include species mixing (mixing of cells from different species), mixing of cells from samples with different genotypes or genetic labels, and cell “hashing” (pooling of cells from separately barcoded samples) (see [55] for a summary of the experimental assay-based methods, including their limitations, for doublet detection). However, most of the existing AD single-cell datasets have not implemented the experimental design features. This review will focus on the model-based doublet detection approaches that are applicable to all AD scRNA-seq datasets currently available.

Assuming that doublets have more RNAs than singlets, the simplest approach is to threshold overall expression content (such as the number of detected genes and total UMI counts) to classify cells with unusually high UMI or gene number as potential doublets [51, 55]. However, the assumption that cells contain similar amount of RNA is unlikely to be true due to diverse cell types or different cell cycle states. Another simple approach is to look for cells expressed with marker genes of more than one distinct cell type [51, 55, 57]. However, this requires expert knowledge of the cell types and the associated markers in the data. There are more advanced and potentially more powerful computational algorithms for doublet detection in scRNA-seq data. In a recent benchmarking study, Xi and Li evaluated nine existing doublet detection methods [54], including Scrublet [55], scran/doubletCells [58], cxds [56], bcds [56], hybrid (combination of cxds and bcds) [56], DoubletDetection [59], DoubletFinder [60], Solo [61], and DoubletDecon [62]. Seven out of the eight standalone methods (except cxds which detects co-expression of markers that are supposedly to be mutually exclusive in the same cell) first generate artificial doublets by mixing observed gene expression profiles from randomly selected droplet pairs. The major difference among these methods is the choice of embedding/dimension reduction and classifier. Via a comprehensive benchmarking on 16 real datasets with experimentally annotated doublets and 112 realistic synthetic datasets, DoubletFinder showed the best prediction accuracy while cxds had the highest computational efficiency. However, one caveat of these computational algorithms is that they were designed to identify “neotypic” doublets, which consist of cells of distinct cell types, and hence difficult to capture “embedded” doublets that encapsulate cells from the same or highly similar cell types [55].

An important cell quality measure is the percentage of reads mapped to the mitochondrial genome in each library. As increased mitochondrial fraction indicates increased apoptosis, increased cell stress, and/or loss of cytoplasmic RNA from lysed cells [52, 63], cells with a high proportion of reads allocated to mitochondrial genomes are deemed poor-quality. A recent systematic survey of scRNA-seq data suggested that a mitochondrial proportion threshold of 10% is appropriate to distinguish between healthy and low-quality cells in most human tissues, while in mouse tissues, the recommended threshold is 5% [64]. However, just like the number of expressed features, selection of a threshold for this parameter is highly dependent on tissue type and experimental setting. For example, 30% of mitochondrial mRNA, which would otherwise indicate cell stress or apoptosis in tissues with low energy need, is normal for a healthy heart muscle cell due to high energy demand [65, 66]. Mitochondrial transcripts are not expressed in nuclei. Yet, variable amounts of mitochondrial transcripts were associated with the snRNA-seq data [8, 41, 42, 67, 68]. For example, in the first snRNA-seq transcriptomic analysis of AD, the fraction of mitochondrial reads exhibited a highly skewed empirical distribution, with an elbow shape which distinctly separates cells with high and low ratios for further classification and removal by k-means clustering (k = 2) on the mitochondrial ratio [8].

Another source of noises in the droplet-based scRNA-seq protocols (e.g., drop-seq or 10x Genomics Chromium protocol) is the contamination of ambient RNAs (cell-free RNAs), which are released in the cell lysis from dead or apoptotic cells before droplet separation. As ambient mRNAs are ubiquitous, they increase background noise and may significantly confound data quality and biological signal [69]. Several methods have been developed to remove the contribution of the ambient RNAs from each cell to recover the true molecular abundance. For example, the SoupX method estimates the ambient mRNA expression profile from empty droplets and the contamination fraction in each cell by making use of known negative cell markers in an identified cell cluster, and then corrects the expression of each cell using the two paratemers [69]. There are other ambient RNA decontamination methods that do not require prior knowledge of negative cell markers, such as DecontX [70] which uses a Bayesian inference model to estimate and remove the background noise, and CellBender [71] which employs a deep generative model to remove the background noise from ambient RNA. In the mixed-sample multiplexing scRNA-seq design, where multiple samples of different genotypes are pooled, or in the presence of subclones, a method called Souporcell can demultiplex cells, identify doublets, and perform joint genotyping and ambient RNA amount estimation by modeling the allele counts of genetic variants available from the reads [72]. Ambient RNA detection and removal is an emerging area of research and just began to be included in the AD snRNA-seq studies [44, 73]. However, since the leak of cytoplasmic RNA by ruptured cells to the cell suspension is unavoidable by the isolation protocols, especially for the case of nuclei isolation from fresh frozen tissues, we expect incorporating the ambient RNA decontamination into the single cell data analysis pipeline will provide much cleaner downstream analysis in future applications of AD.

Quality control and filtering on genes

Genes with low abundance should be removed since they do not contain sufficient information for reliable downstream statistical analysis [74]. Thresholds can be set for the number of cells expressing a gene or the mean expression of a gene [52]. The cell number threshold could be very liberal (e.g., 2 cells in some of the published brain disease studies [8, 68]). Still, it is critical not to exceed the minimal cell cluster size that one may reasonably expect [75].

Further, depending on the downstream analysis, some feature categories such as non-coding genes may not be of interest and hence could be removed to reduce the data complexity [8]. Mitochondrially expressed genes can be also discarded after cell QC in snRNA-seq data to avoid biases introduced during the nuclei isolation since mitochondrial transcripts are not expressed inside a nucleus [8, 67, 68].

Normalization

The observed single-cell read count data could be impacted by many biological and technical factors, including but not limited to sequencing depth, capture efficiency, and cell composition. Between-sample normalization can remove these sample-specific biases and mitigate the batch effect. The simplest method is scaling normalization, which corrects for sequencing depth difference by dividing the feature-level read counts by the library size (i.e., total read counts within each sample) and multiplying a constant value (e.g., 10,000). The library size corrected data is usually log-transformed after adding value 1 to prevent the logarithm of 0. This normalization strategy is implemented in popular tools like scanpy [50] and Seurat [76]. However, similar to bulk RNA-seq normalization, library size as a scaling factor is likely to bias towards highly expressed transcripts. In the context of bulk RNA-seq, there are three most popular methods for robust scaling normalization, including 1) the trimmed mean of M-values (TMM) [77], which calculates scaling factors by trimming away genes with extreme fold changes between samples; 2) the upper-quartile (UQ) method [78], which uses per-sample upper-quartile (75-th percentile) to scale counts; 3) the relative log-expression (RLE) [79], which scales to a pseudo-reference derived from the geometric mean of gene counts across cells.

While these bulk-based methods are still widely used in scRNA-seq data [74, 80], the excessive zeros in the scRNA-seq data jeopardize their effectiveness in calculating proper scaling factors. For example, the TMM method tends to overcorrect for the scaling factors [80] and the upper-quartile could be zero for many cells with low sequencing depth. Moreover, calculating the pseudo-reference sample from the geometric mean across cells can be applied to only the potentially minimal number of genes with non-zero reads in every single cell [80]. Alternatively, the dropout reads can be imputed by assuming a mixture model that includes two latent probability distributions: the probability of the true expressed reads and dropout reads among the true expressed reads. These model-based methods include SAVER [81] (Poisson-Gamma mixture model) and scImpute (Normal-Gamma mixture model) [82]. Markov Affinity-based Graph Imputation of Cells (MAGIC), on the other hand, utilizes a diffusion kernel to identify similar cells in reduced dimension, and infer the dropout reads from the similar cells [83].

Several scRNA-seq-specific normalization methods have been developed and they can be primarily classified into two categories: 1) cell-based normalization by estimating a cell-specific global size factor to normalize all the genes in the same cell, and 2) gene-based normalization by parametric modeling of individual genes. The scran package adopts the cell-based normalization approach by pooling the cells to estimate more robust size factors and avoid the impact of excessive zeros. Then pool-based size factors are “deconvolved” to yield cell-specific factors [84]. In contrast, the gene-based normalization methods, such as the SCnorm [85] and the Pearson residuals method SCTransform in the Seurat package [76], perform adjustments individually for each group of genes with different sequencing depths or different ranges of abundance levels. In addition to the correction for sequencing depth bias for different groups of genes, parametric modeling of count data can account for more complex technical or biological variations, such as batch effect, mitochondrial transcript fraction, cell cycle effect, cellular detection rate (fraction of detected genes), and the average number of counts per detected genes [86,87,88,89]. Moreover, cell-level and gene-level variations can be jointly modeled in a unified framework. For instance, for better separation of unwanted variation from biological signals in noisy, zero-inflated scRNA-seq data, Risso et al. proposed a Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial-based Wanted Variation Extraction (ZINB-WaVE) method, which incorporates not only observed and unobserved sample-level but also gene-level covariates (e.g., sequence length and GC content) [90].

Unwanted sources of variations such as batch effects should be adjusted using single-cell dedicated tools (e.g., MNN [91], CCA [92]), or general linear regression modeling tool (e.g., limma [93], ComBat [94]). Deep learning-based data denoising tools such as deep count autoencoder (DCA) [95] and single-cell variational inference (scVI) [96] are also attractive alternatives to handle unwanted variations in scRNA-seq.

Recommended workflow and application to AD

Figure 2 illustrates a workflow of preprocessing sc/snRNA-seq data, i.e., data QC and normalization. For data QC, we recommend to first inspect the distribution of cell-level read count statistics, such as the total number of UMI counts, the number of detected genes, and the percentage of mitochondrial reads. If no sample presents dramatically different data quality, we expect to see similar cell-level data distribution across donors. Otherwise, we should check if the sample data quality difference is associated with any biological or technical variable. Then confounding technical variables could be taken into account in the data normalization. For example, Seurat’s SCTransform normalization approach has an option “vars.to.regress” to regress out confounding factors. To investigate if any particular variables play significant contribution to the cell-level gene expression variation, mixed model variance component analysis (such as implementation by the R package variancePartition [97]) can be used to quantify the variance attributable to individual factors. For data normalization, we recommend evaluating several different methods. For example, start with the simplest approach of the global scaling by sequencing depth, and proceed to clustering and differential expression analysis (Sections C, D, and E). Then compare the clustering results of the simple method with those from more advanced/complex methods. We favor the methods that lead to better separation of cell clusters with clear cell type annotations and biological meaningful signatures. In cases of combining multiple batches (or conditions) of single cell data where there is batch (or condition) specific cell clustering, an elegant integration method such as Seurat/CCA [92] and harmony [98] should be used after normalization of individual datasets to minimize the batch difference.

After obtaining the single cell or single nucleus sequencing count data, a series of quality control processes are conducted to filter low quality cells with unusually high or low gene coverage or sequencing depth, unusually high mitochondrial content, ambient RNA, and doublets etc. QCed count data is normalized by either a global scaling approach or advanced parametric modeling of the zero-inflated count data distribution. If there exists batch or condition-specific clustering of the cells, a data integration method like MNN and CCA can be used to correct the batch difference to ensure that cells of the same cell type cluster together Full size image

In the first snRNA-seq analysis of control and AD brains by Mathys et al. [8], nuclei with fewer than 200 detected genes or an abnormally high ratio of mitochondrial reads were removed. Mitochondrially encoded genes were removed and only protein-coding genes detected in at least 2 nuclei were selected. In AD snRNA-seq study by Zhou et al. [57], they selected the nuclei with no more than 5% mitochondrial reads, 400–20,000 UMIs and 400–7000 genes as determined by UMI/gene distribution. In another AD snRNA-seq study by Grubman et al., the nuclei with more than 10% of their UMIs assigned to mitochondrial genes or nuclei outside the 5th and 95th percentiles in the number of detected genes or the number of UMIs were filtered out [41]. Similarly, AD snRNA-seq data analyses by Nguyen et al. [43], Lau et al. [99], and Gerrits et al. [44] also QCed their data by mitochondrial content and read count cutoffs, albeit with slightly different threshold values. In addition, Gerrits et al. conducted ambient RNA and cytoplasmic RNA identification to recover more cells from the raw data. In all these AD snRNA-seq studies, QCed data were normalized by the total library size multiplied by a factor of 10,000, except in the Zhou et al. study where they further regressed the total number of UMIs by a negative binomial model.

Feature selection and dimension reduction

Dimension reduction is to identify a few latent variables that explain the most variance in data. Selecting the most informative gene features can improve the detection efficiency and quality of the latent variables. The criteria for selecting informative genes include high biological variances with which the technical variance is modeled by the fitted relationship between mean and variance or spike-ins [74, 76, 84], and strong correlations with different cell types [17, 92] or known pathways (PAGODA) [100].

Then, the latent variables underlying the informative genes are identified by various techniques. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is an efficient linear algorithm applicable to large-scale matrices and preserves both local and long-range structures. Each principal component is an orthogonal vector to the rest, and their linear combinations can reconstruct the global transcriptome. The PCA dimension can be determined by selecting top PCs accounting for 80 ~ 90% of total variances, PCs with significantly higher loading than bootstrapped data, or detecting an elbow point in the PC loading plot [92]. Several PCA variants have emerged to handle drop-out reads via zero-inflated negative binomial distribution (ZINB) [90].

t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) is a non-linear approach to preserve the local structures in the high-dimensional data [101]. Due to the emphasis on the local structure, t-SNE has gained popularity for effectively segregating clusters, but loses long-range structures [34]. Diffusion map (DM) is another popular non-linear method that projects both local and long-range structures to a lower dimension and is optimized to trace gradual changes in a transcriptome [102]. However, DM and t-SNE are computationally expensive. Recently, a computationally more scalable method, uniform manifold approximation, and projection (UMAP), has been proposed to include more long-range structures than t-SNE [103]. UMAP shows superio","1 Overview of the bioinformatics approaches to analyze scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq, and spatial transcriptomics data with a focus on scRNA-seq data.
scRNA-seq data can also be integrated with bulk RNA-seq data to robustly identify key molecular changes and network structures (M).
While these bulk-based methods are still widely used in scRNA-seq data [74, 80], the excessive zeros in the scRNA-seq data jeopardize their effectiveness in calculating proper scaling factors.
Traditional metrics and clustering algorithms from bulk RNA-sequencing data analysis have been readily adopted in scRNA-seq analysis [105].

""I was angry and hurt. I don't know how to really explain it, but I could feel it in my chest,"" said Edwin Beardy.

The 70-year-old from Tataskweyak Cree Nation suffers from Kennedy's Disease, a rare degenerative disorder that causes muscle weakening in his face and legs, resulting in difficulty walking and articulating his speech.

On Feb. 19, Beardy drove from Tataskweyak to Thompson to pick up a bed that he had ordered days earlier, only to be told by the staff that some of the parts hadn't arrived.

When Beardy explained he had been told to come pick up the bed on that day and it was a nearly two-hour drive, he was told they would give him a refund.

The 70-year-old went to see a different staff member to get the refund and explained his situation, when a different staff member came and suggested he return to the store sober.

""I said, 'What? I don't even drink,'"" Beardy said.

""I didn't expect to be treated like that. I went in, I paid for a bed. I expected that bed.""

RCMP called

Beardy left the store and got in his car. While he was sitting there, an RCMP cruiser pulled up behind him with lights flashing.

The officers told Beardy they need to take a breath sample. Beardy said he had to make multiple attempts, as his condition made it difficult to blow into the device, but eventually the result showed zero alcohol content in his blood.

A spokesperson for the RCMP confirmed they made a traffic stop in the area and obtained a breath sample, which came back at zero.

Beardy believes staff at the store made assumptions about him because of his Indigenous identity and his disability.

""I'm handicapped, or maybe, I don't know, the way I walked ... It kind of shocked me, what they were doing. Why, why are they doing this?""

He calls it an incident of ""racial profiling.""

""It's stereotyping Indian people of being drunks, that's the way I see it ... I think that's discrimination against native people.""

Sensitivity training

A representative of The Brick told CBC that the store in Thompson is a franchise location not directly owned and operated by the company, but that they had spoken to the owner, as well as Manitoba Keewatinowi Okimakanak, which represents northern First Nations governments.

""The assumption that was made was clearly wrong, and we recognize that. We've instructed all staff members that the decision was wrong,"" said Greg Nakonechny, vice-president legal at The Brick.

The store would be making a formal apology to both Beardy and Tataskweyak Cree Nation, Nakonechny said.

""We will also undertake to complete sensitivity training for all staff members, so that's our hope that this never recurs again,"" he said.

Until the staff go through that training, however, Beardy says he has no interest in meeting with the people from the store to hear their apology.

""I'm still very angry,"" he said.

This isn't the only incident of Indigenous people being accused of being intoxicated by staff at businesses in Thompson. Beardy says he personally knows of three other similar incidents happening to friends and relatives within the last three years.

MKO Grand Chief Garrison Settee released a statement Monday condemning the incident.

""The Brick needs to respect that they are on First Nation territory, and as such, are required to respect the first citizens of this land,"" Settee said in the statement.

""It is also essential businesses are aware of the significant role First Nations have in providing a strong economic base in the City of Thompson.""

Beardy said he plans to meet with representatives from MKO to talk about the issue.

It is expected to increase to S$650 by Sep 1, 2025.

“In addition to quotas, qualifying salaries and levies are in place to ensure that S Pass holders are hired because they fill skills gaps, and not simply because they are cheaper than locals,” said MOM.

JOBS EXCLUDED

But firms will be allowed to hire workers for some jobs on work permits once the higher salary benchmarks kick in on Sep 1 next year. This is as some firms hire rank-and-file workers on S Passes due to the source restrictions for work permit holders.

“We will introduce a Non-Traditional Source (NTS) occupation list, which is a tight list of rank-and-file occupations where employers will be allowed to hire NTS foreign workers on work permits,” Dr Tan said.

These include cooks in Indian restaurants, food processing workers, sheet metal workers, welders and flame cutters, riggers and cable splicers, and other such workers in manufacturing and engineering firms.

""I know many enjoy ... the multicultural cuisines in Singapore. I hope that this will reinforce our position as a food paradise supporting the cultural heritage of Singapore,"" said the minister.

These workers will need to be higher-skilled and be subject to a quota. They can also only perform the occupation stated on their work permit.

MOM will also introduce a Manpower for Strategic Economic Priorities (M-SEP) scheme, which provides foreign manpower flexibilities for a period of time to firms that contribute to Singapore’s strategic economic priorities and local workforce development.

To be eligible for the scheme, firms will have to meet criteria such as taking part in selected programmes for research and internationalisation. They will also have to commit to developing their local workforce.

The scheme will be available for three years and more details will be provided later.

CONCERNS ABOUT RAISING S PASS SALARIES

Dr Tan said there have been questions about whether increasing the S Pass qualifying salary means that foreign S Pass holders will automatically get a pay raise, perhaps at the expense of their local colleagues.

But if the S Pass salary is not raised, then local workers’ salaries will also stagnate, said Dr Tan.

""The firm can continue to renew the S Pass holder on the lowest salary required, so long as he is willing to accept it. And the firm will then have little reason to raise the pay for the other nine locals who are doing the same job.""

He has also come across suggestions to load all the increase on levies. This will make the levy much higher, and apply equally to all S Pass holders.

“More productive firms that hire high-quality S Pass holders well above the qualifying salary, will face the same cost increase as less productive firms who are paying just the bare minimum,” said Dr Tan.

He added that the higher qualifying salary will only apply to work pass renewals from September 2023, and this could stretch out to 2026, depending on when the S Pass holder is due for renewal.

“The firm will have ample time to think about alternative options, for instance, finding or training up another local. This is especially so if the foreigner is not bringing enough value to justify the pay increase,” said Dr Tan.

He also pointed out that there are quotas at the S Pass level, but if employers still unfairly raise foreigners’ pay, without fairly reviewing the pay of locals, then workers can take their grievances to the Tripartite Alliance for Fair & Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP).

To businesses that have said that it is hard to find locals in a tight labour market, Dr Tan urged them to redesign their jobs to make them more flexible and inclusive to attract local workers.

He pointed out that there is a “significant untapped supply” of manpower from women and seniors outside the labour force.

“With the S Pass moves, businesses that are reliant on low-cost S Pass holders will have to adapt. They will have to redesign their operations to become more productive. They will have to improve the pay and working conditions for these jobs. And because of this, they will be in a stronger position to attract locals,” he said.","This is as some firms hire rank-and-file workers on S Passes due to the source restrictions for work permit holders.

These were the findings of a survey released last Friday. It had been conducted by the European Chamber of Commerce in Singapore (EuroCham) to assess the extent and severity of the impact of rising rental costs on business operations here.

The survey in March polled 268 businesses in total, with respondents employed by companies of all sizes.

EuroCham is an independent non-profit organisation representing the common interests of the European business community and promotes bilateral trade, services and investments among Europe, Singapore and the region.

It was found that 70 per cent of businesses surveyed are facing increasing difficulty in maintaining operations in Singapore due to rising rental and operational costs.

432,432,https://www.oxygen.com/new-york-homicide/crime-news/why-did-killer-andres-fernandez-shoot-louis-barbati,Why Did Killer Andres Fernandez Shoot Louis Barbati?,"Was the brutal slaying of Brooklyn pizzeria owner Louis Barbati a mob hit, a robbery gone wrong, or something else?

New York City is famous for iconic restaurants, and L&B Spumoni Gardens pizzeria in Brooklyn is one of the most legendary. Louis Barbati, the pie palace’s proud and gregarious co-owner, was just as beloved and respected.

So when Barbati, 61, known to intimates by his nickname of LuLu, was gunned down in broad daylight in the backyard of his Brooklyn home on June 30, 2016, loved ones, loyal customers, and members of the NYPD were left reeling.

Barbati’s wife, Joanne, called 911, and police rushed to their home in the Dyker Heights area of Brooklyn. Officers found Barbati with five gunshot wounds lying face down on steps leading up to his back door.

“We knew he’d been shot numerous times. Even if he was a block away from the emergency room, he didn't have a chance,” Det. James Hemmer, NYPD, Brooklyn North Homicide Squad, told “New York Homicide,” airing Saturdays at 9/8c on Oxygen.

Barbati was pronounced dead at the scene. When his body was taken away detectives focused on a bag underneath him. The sack contained more than $15,000. Why was he holding so much cash? Was his murder a botched burglary? Was it a mob hit? As police looked for answers, the story that Barbati's murder could be mafia-related became headline news.

Louis Barbati

Although police had no proof of mob involvement in the murder, the lead had to be explored. At the request of the NYPD, the FBI joined the case and pursued possible mob connections in the slaying, as the NYPD followed up on the robbery angle.

The FBI focused on the alleged “mob war” over the theft of L&B’s renowned sauce recipe that had “nearly boiled over into bloodshed,” reported the Daily News.

“Spumoni Gardens played no part in the feud,” said Robert K. Boyce, former NYPD chief of detectives. “But there was allegedly a sit down between two crime families to settle the dispute over the source of the recipe.”

However, the mob connection line of investigation led to a dead end.

In the meantime, the NYPD learned that L&B paid out period bonuses during the year to its six co-owners, said Sr. A.D.A. Emily Dean, former Kings County DA’s Office. The cash Barbati was carrying when he was killed – $15,483 – was the exact amount of the bonus.

Police then got a lead when one neighbor of the victim reported seeing a suspicious car — a white Acura TL — parked near the crime scene the day of the slaying. Another neighbor told detectives that he saw the shooter fleeing the scene while wearing a dark-colored sweatshirt and running toward the white Acura.

Witness statements about the car and the man in a sweatshirt were confirmed by home security camera footage obtained by the police. They believed his long-sleeved top could have covered telltale tattoos. Investigators also observed that the man walked with a subtle limp and was carrying a gun.

“What the videotapes don’t show is the actual moments of the weapons being discharged,” said Arthur Aidala, a Barbati family friend and attorney. “Who is this guy? Where did he come from?”

To help them identify the man seen fleeing from the murder scene, police released images to the public and offered a $2,500 Crime Stoppers reward for information. Barbati’s family put up $50,000 on their own for tips leading to an arrest.

Soon, a Crime Stoppers caller identified the man fleeing the scene as Andres Fernandez. The former construction worker fit the man in the surveillance video “to a T,” said Dean.

Originally from Brooklyn, he lived in Long Island, New York. He had a minor criminal record, detectives said. He drove a white Acura TL.

To bolster their case, detectives traced Fernandez’s whereabouts on the day of the murder using cell phone data and tower pings. They confirmed he was near the Barbati home when he was killed.

Evidence was falling into place, but police were stumped about his motive for murdering Barbati.

Still, Fernandez was arrested at his home on November 3, 2016. He requested a lawyer and refused to make any statement.

His white Acura TL was in his garage. Clothes matching what he was wearing in the security footage were collected as evidence, along with a business card from his wallet. Barbati’s home address was written on the back of the card.

After a thorough investigation into the possibility of the murder being a mob hit over pizza sauce, the FBI determined that case “had nothing to do with this incident,” said Hemmer.

Law enforcement never found a link between Fernandez and L&B other than video surveillance that put him at the restaurant on the day of the crime.

Fernandez’s trial began in December 2019. Joanne Barbati’s emotional testimony shook the courtroom, according to Phil Grimaldi, a retired detective, NYPD, Brooklyn South Homicide Squad and Barbati’s cousin.

However, Fernandez “showed no remorse,” Grimaldi said. “And he sat there like he was sitting on a park bench watching the birds, twiddling his thumbs.

Andres Fernandez was found guilty of second-degree murder and second-degree criminal possession of a weapon. He was sentenced to 24 years to life in prison.

Barbati’s family is “still tortured by the lack of a motive,” said Aidala.

The cases reported last week had raised concerns they were caused by a new strain of H5N1, clade 2.3.4.4b, which emerged in 2020 and has caused record numbers of deaths among wild birds and domestic poultry in recent months.

But work so far suggests this is not the case.

Preliminary genetic sequencing carried out in Cambodia led its health ministry to identify the viruses as H5 clade 2.3.2.1c, which has circulated in Cambodia among birds and poultry for many years and has sporadically caused infections in people, the CDC said in a statement on Saturday (Feb 25).

""Yes, this is an older clade of avian influenza that had been circulating around the region for a number of years and while it has caused human infections in the past, it has not been seen to cause human-to-human transmission. However, that doesn't mean that the threat is any less,"" said Erik Karlsson, director of the National Influenza Center of Cambodia and acting head of virology at the Institut Pasteur du Cambodge, which sequenced the virus.

He added that the response needed to be coordinated and swift to prevent any further spread and to limit exposure to any common source.

An investigation into the source and to detect any additional cases is ongoing, the CDC said, adding that so far there had been no indication of person-to-person spread.

Cambodia tested at least 12 people for the H5N1 strain last week, after an 11-year-old girl died from the virus in the first known transmission to humans in the country in nearly a decade.

The victim's father, who was part of a group the girl had been in contact with in a province east of the capital Phnom Penh, tested positive for the virus but did not exhibit any symptoms, Cambodia's Health Minister Mam Bunheng had said in a statement on Friday.

Only the girl's case has been sequenced and the father's case is still being worked on, Karlsson said.

The World Health Organization said it is working with Cambodian authorities following the cases, describing the situation as worrying due to the recent rise in cases in birds and mammals.","The viruses that infected two people in Cambodia with H5N1 avian influenza have been identified as an endemic clade of bird flu circulating in the country, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said.

Researchers revealed on Tuesday that an American, described as a middle-aged woman of mixed race, has likely been cured of HIV after undergoing a new transplant procedure using donated umbilical cord blood.

The patient, who needed a stem cell transplant for leukemia, reportedly developed a new HIV-resistant immune system following a breakthrough procedure in which she was genetically matched with umbilical cord stem cells that contained an HIV-resistant mutation.

She was part of a study that began in 2015 designed to monitor outcomes of 25 people with HIV in the U.S. who underwent a transplant, according to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

Dr. Yvonne Bryson, an infectious disease physician at UCLA, who led the study, discussed their team's finding along with the patient's condition at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections this week.

""Today, we reported the third known case of HIV remission and the first woman following a stem cell transplant and using HIV-resistant cells,"" Bryson said in a press conference.

""This case is special for several reasons: First, our participant was a U.S. woman living with HIV of mixed race, who needed a stem cell transplant for treatment of her leukemia. And she would find a more difficult time finding both a genetic match and one with the HIV-resistant mutation to both cure her cancer and potentially her HIV. This is a natural, but rare mutation.""

Bryson added that while this approach of using genetically-matched umbilical cord blood with HIV-resistant mutation opens the door to more diverse populations and studies, she confirmed there is no current routine screening in place in the U.S. for this mutation.

Previously, only two men have been cured of HIV using a bone marrow or stem cell transplant. And while this is the third known case, according to Bryson's team, of HIV remission in an individual who received a stem cell transplant of any kind, experts in the field caution that this method is not ideal for curing the many millions of HIV-positive people around the globe today.

Bryson said there could eventually be ""approximately at least 50 [people] per year that may benefit from this.""

In an interview with Community Health Center, Inc., Dr. Anthony Fauci, the leading expert in infectious disease in the U.S., whose work in HIV care and treatment innovation spans four decades, said, ""I don't want people to think that now this is something that can be applied to the 36 million people [globally] who are living with HIV.""

""This person had an underlying disease that required a stem cell transplant. ... It is not practical to think that this is something that's going to be widely available,"" Fauci added. ""It's more of a proof of concept.""

While there is no practical and applicable cure for HIV on a large scale, there have been incredible strides in HIV treatment over the years that allow individuals to live a normal and healthy life.

Known as U=U, or Undetectable=Untransmittable, if an HIV-positive person begins HIV treatment and brings the virus in their body to an undetectable level, the individual cannot transmit the virus to someone as long as they remain on said treatment or medication.

Last month, the The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first long-acting injectable drug for HIV prevention.

Until recently, the only medications licensed and approved by the FDA for HIV prevention or pre-exposure prophylaxis, most commonly known as PrEP, were daily pills, which slow the progression of an HIV infection in the body.

PrEP is usually taken daily so that it builds up in in a person's system, to the point that if there is an HIV infection, it prevents the virus from replicating and spreading throughout the body.

When taken as prescribed, PrEP services reduce the risk of getting HIV from sex by about 99%, according to new data from the CDC. Now, individuals who feel at-risk of HIV infection have the option of taking the daily pill, or the new shot every two months, after two initiation injections administered one month apart.

On the vaccine front, Moderna recently announced that it's launched early stage clinical trials of an HIV mRNA vaccine. ABC News previously reported that the biotechnology company teamed up with the nonprofit International AIDS Vaccine Initiative to develop the shot, which uses the same technology as Moderna's successful COVID-19 vaccine.

Because bone marrow transplantation is a dangerous and risky procedure, it is considered unethical to perform on people with HIV, unless the person also has cancer and needs a transplant as part of their treatment.

436,436,https://bmcgastroenterol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12876-022-02143-x,Objective disease activity assessment and therapeutic drug monitoring prior to biologic therapy changes in routine inflammatory bowel disease clinical practice: TARGET-IBD - BMC Gastroenterology,"In this cohort study of IBD patients receiving biologic therapy and undergoing treatment changes, up to 1/3 of individuals did not undergo objective disease activity assessment or therapeutic drug monitoring prior to the modification. In patients receiving biologics with routinely available TDM capability, nearly 2/3 of subjects did not undergo TDM evaluation. Understanding reasons and mechanisms for clinical loss of response are imperative to therapeutic decision making to optimize outcomes in IBD patients on biologics.

Societal guideline statements currently recommend assessing for objective disease activity when faced with new or recurrent symptoms and performing reactive TDM in light of secondary loss of response [12]. The current study suggests that while at least one objective assessment occurs in the majority of individuals prior to a change or discontinuation of a biologic therapy for lack of clinical efficacy, a significant portion do not. Even extending the assessment window to 6 months before or including the 3-month period after a dose adjustment or therapy discontinuation only yielded an additional 7 to 10% participants undergoing objective evaluation or TDM (Additional file 1: Tables S1a–S2b). This suggests that some clinicians are relying on clinical symptomatology and empiric therapeutic adjustments rather than objective data. Potential alternative explanations for the lack of universal assessment include: (1) testing performed at outside centers; (2) other objective metrics utilized such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate or fecal lactoferrin, (3) local health care or payer environment results in limited ability to utilize these assessments universally in routine clinical practice, or (4) certain clinical situations dictate other action (e.g., ongoing disease flare > 3–6 months, severely ill patient). It should be noted that if the results are available in the enrolling center’s EMR (e.g., scanned lab results), it was included in the TARGET-IBD data; however, data from other institutions via interoperability platforms (e.g. Care Everywhere in Epic) is not transmitted or abstracted by TARGET-IBD due to legal restrictions. While only CRP and FC were assessed in this study, these markers have demonstrated superior test characteristics compared to other biomarkers [20,21,22]. Another potential explanation includes delayed adaptation of such assessment strategies due to the body of evidence available at the time and clinician discretion in implementing the recommended strategies.

On multivariable modeling, the completion of objective assessment prior to a change in therapy was independently associated with site of care, with academic centers being 59% more likely to perform than community centers. There are several possible explanations, including more familiarity with recently published studies or guidelines in academic centers, clinical workload or support differences between sites of care to obtain and interpret such studies, or variable access to some of the markers such as calprotectin or MRI. Reasons for the differences between sites of care should be explored in future studies and efforts made to bridge any gaps or opportunities identified.

Interestingly, compared to participants receiving adalimumab, those receiving infliximab were significantly less likely to undergo objective assessment before a change in therapy. The exact reason for this difference is unclear. Potential explanations include the wide dosing range available to infliximab, familiarity with alternative dosing strategies, or differences in payer coverage or requirements for dose changes between the two agents. Furthermore, those receiving ustekinumab were also less likely to undergo objective assessments compared to adalimumab. We hypothesize this may be due to utilization of ustekinumab in a more biologic refractory population during the study period as well as more nascent data on TDM implications with ustekinumab compared to anti-TNFs. Thus, when faced with symptoms suggestive of active disease, a dose change may be implemented empirically as limited medical alternatives existed. These biologic specific differences were not seen in the TDM model. Additional studies are needed to explore these differences and potential reasons.

In the current study, nearly 2/3 of individuals receiving infliximab or adalimumab did not undergo TDM prior to a therapeutic change, either dose or agent. The utility of TDM in aiding therapeutic decision making and influencing disease-related costs and outcomes has been demonstrated in several retrospective and prospective studies [16, 23,24,25,26,27,28]. The current data suggests that real-world utilization of TDM, despite American Gastroenterological Association recommendations [12], still faces significant practice implementation challenges. These may include provider (e.g., lack of knowledge about TDM, critical position on TDM, lack of access or difficulty with ordering process), payer (e.g., lack of coverage, large out of pocket expenses), patient (e.g., does not obtain testing even when ordered, distance to travel), or system (e.g., lack of in-house testing) explanations. In a survey of gastroenterologists, lack of insurance coverage and high out of pocket costs were cited by a majority of responders as significant barriers to TDM implementation in real-world practice [29]. Our data reflects these challenges despite limiting the TDM patient population to those receiving infliximab or adalimumab, the two agents with most available TDM data and commercial testing ability. Thus, there remains a significant discordance between data-driven guideline recommendations and real-world capability and practice patterns.

With an increasing breadth of biologic and small molecule options for treating IBD, there may be a temptation by clinicians to simply change biologic therapy rather than assess and optimize when faced with potential loss of efficacy. However, the number of available treatments is not infinite. Multiple studies have demonstrated that subsequent biologic agents are typically less efficacious than the first and often more costly. Thus, emphasis must be laid on understanding and optimizing available therapies. Furthermore, in the pivotal CALM trial [15], proactive objective assessments of biomarkers and disease activity with resultant changes in the therapy when indicated improved Crohn’s disease outcomes. Despite this, real-world objective assessments after initiating biologic therapy remains incomplete. In a study of practice patterns from 2007 to 2016 using the Truven MarketScan database, Limketkai et al., reported 56.4% of CD patients and 67.8% of UC patients undergoing objective evaluations within 6 months of starting a biologic, rates similar to the current reactive evaluation [30]. The authors also demonstrated geographic variability, substantiating the inconsistency in real-world practice patterns. Accordingly, there remains a gap in real-world disease evaluation and biologic optimization that may influence IBD population-level outcomes.

Limitations of this study include the utilization of available clinical information. Certain data such as outside testing or procedures could be missing if not incorporated into the enrolling investigator’s EMR. However, for TDM data, which can include outside lab testing facilities, if testing was performed and mentioned in the clinical documentation, this was counted as performed, even if results not available. These limitations are similar to almost all real-world studies relying upon available clinical documentation and data. The majority of the study population was enrolled by an academic center, and thus may create both referral bias and generalizability issues. To this end, if the majority of patients are seen at academic centers and standard of care is deviating from guideline recommendations, this is even more critical to understand and reflective of real-world practice patterns. Similarly, TARGET-IBD is derived from U.S. centers and generalizability to other health care systems is limited. The exact reason for lack of testing on an individual level is unknown; however, we included only those with reasons for change or discontinuation as lack of efficacy, nonresponse, or antidrug antibody formation. Such a population represents scenarios where objective testing or TDM is most likely to be pursued. However, due to lack of prospective determination of reasons for change, full generalizability to all clinical situations is limited. Data limitations of TARGET-IBD include lack of detailed socioeconomic status data that may influence access to specialty care and related testing. In this study, only patients on infliximab or adalimumab were included in the TDM analysis and thus rates of TDM for other biologics is unknown. This was chosen as these agents have the most robust TDM data and available commercial testing capability. Including all biologics would be valuable, as many of the second line therapies are expensive; moreover, this likely would have resulted in even lower rates of TDM assessment.","In this cohort study of IBD patients receiving biologic therapy and undergoing treatment changes, up to 1/3 of individuals did not undergo objective disease activity assessment or therapeutic drug monitoring prior to the modification.
In patients receiving biologics with routinely available TDM capability, nearly 2/3 of subjects did not undergo TDM evaluation.
This suggests that some clinicians are relying on clinical symptomatology and empiric therapeutic adjustments rather than objective data.

For some people with Lyme disease, symptoms extend well beyond “successful” treatment with antibiotics.

A new study finds that dead, left-behind bits of the bacteria that cause Lyme disease may be the culprit.

The research shows that these unviable fragments cause even more neurological and musculoskeletal inflammation than the live bacteria.

It is hoped that future treatment can neutralize or clear out these lingering fragments.

A 2-to-4-week regimen of oral antibiotics cures Lyme disease for most people. However, for some, the symptoms linger for months. Among these symptoms are cognitive dysfunction — difficulty thinking — and musculoskeletal pain.

A new study from researchers at Tulane University, in New Orleans, has discovered what may be the reason.

After antibiotics have treated the bacteria responsible for Lyme disease, dead fragments are left behind, and these cause inflammation in the central and peripheral nervous systems.

Lead study author Dr. Geetha Parthasarathy, an assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at Tulane University’s National Primate Research Center, explains:

“As neuroinflammation is the basis of many neurological disorders, lingering inflammation in the brain due to these unresolved fragments could cause long-term health consequences.”

Dr. Michal Křupka, of Palacký University Olomouc, in Czechia — who was not involved in the study — told Medical News Today, “Excessive activation of the immune system is thought to play a role in this case, rather than the infection itself.”

In an email to MNT, Dr. Parthasarathy wrote:

“In essence, if a live bacterium is like a packed suitcase, then dead bacterial debris is like its contents upended, covering a larger area, stimulating more cells to release more inflammatory mediators.”","Share on Pinterest A recent study in animals helps explain the persistent symptoms of Lyme disease.

Offspring born to mothers with Crohn’s disease (CD), but not ulcerative colitis, are at higher risk of infection, suggests a study. This association is partly mediated by adverse birth outcomes and antitumour necrosis factor α (anti-TNFα) agents.

“The association between anti-TNFα agents and paediatric infection could be partially explained by maternal CD,” the authors said.

A total of 1,343,960 live-born singletons born in Denmark from 1995 to 2016 were included in this population-based study, with maternal inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) as the exposure. The authors assessed offspring infection at <5 years of age, defined by either infection-related hospitalization or systemic antibiotic prescription. An inverse probability-weighted marginal structural model was used for mediation analysis.

Maternal CD was associated with an 18-percent increased risk of offspring infection-related hospitalization (hazard ratio, 1.18, 95 percent confidence interval [CI], 1.10‒1.26) and a 16-percent increased frequency of prescribed antibiotics (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.16, 95 percent CI, 1.11‒1.21).

Notably, anti-TNFα agents accounted for 10 percent of 3 percent of the two estimated total associations, respectively, while a composite of preterm birth, low birth weight, and small for gestational age was responsible for 4 percent and 0 percent, respectively.

Additional adjustment for maternal CD attenuated the association between prenatal anti-TNFα and frequency of antibiotics (IRR, from 1.23, 95 percent CI, 0.98‒1.55 to 1.10, 95 percent CI, 0.87‒1.40).

Millet is a low maintenance and drought-resistant grain. People often use it to feed livestock, but consumer interest is growing. This grain provides various health benefits and has multiple uses in cooking. People have benefited from the nutritional properties of millet for thousands of years. The Old Testament of the Bible mentions it, as do texts from ancient Greece and Rome. Millet grows extremely quickly and matures in almost half the time required for rice and wheat. This makes it the ideal crop, contributing to its rapid spread across Asia and into Europe. Millet is now the sixth most important cereal grain in the world. In the contemporary United States, millet is often used to feed pets, livestock, and birds, but it is growing in consumer popularity. This is because it is gluten free and a good source of protein, fiber, micronutrients. It also provides multiple benefits to physical and mental health, requires few inputs to grow, and is resistant to drought. This article discusses the types of millet available, its nutritional properties and benefits, potential downsides to millet, and how to use it in cooking.

Types of millet Share on Pinterest Str/Xinhua via Getty Images There are more than 20 different types of millet. Some of the more common varieties include: pearl (Pennisetum glaucum)

finger (Eleusine coracana)

foxtail (Setaria italica)

proso (Panicum miliaceum)

barnyard ( Echinochloa utilis )

Nutritional facts Each 100 gram (g) of cooked millet contains the following: 3.51 g of protein

23.7 g of carbohydrate

1.3 g of dietary fiber

44 milligrams (mg) of magnesium

0.161 mg of copper

100 mg of phosphorus

0.272 mg of manganese

Potential downsides to health Although millet contains many vital nutrients, it also contains compounds called antinutrients. These interfere with the body’s ability to absorb nutrients. Different kinds of millet have different levels of these compounds. Pearl millet contains phytates, which make it harder for the body to absorb nutrients, and goitrogenic polyphenols. These may play a role in the incidence of goiters in diets high in millet. Finger millet also has antinutritional factors that include tannins, protease inhibitors, oxalates, and phytate. Researchers have found that using different processing techniques can reduce levels of antinutrients, including: milling

parboiling

blanching

dehulling

fermenting

germinating

Preparation Millet is available in many grocery and health food stores, and people can also purchase it online. People can buy millet as: intact grains

flakes

flour Find millet products available online here. People can usually keep millet grains at room temperature for 2 months or in the freezer for 4 months. If people store it in a sealed, airtight container or in the refrigerator, millet can last for up to a year.

How to use millet in cooking To get more flavor out of the millet, toast the seeds lightly for 4–5 minutes until golden brown. A 2-to-1 water to millet ratio will get you a quinoa-like consistency. For porridge, use a 3-to-1 ratio and stir often. Season as needed. For a creamier texture, use more liquid. People can prepare millet in many different ways. It can be soft and smooth, like a porridge, or light, fluffy, and slightly chewy, like rice. There are various recipes and ways a person can cook with millet. The following are summaries of popular sweet and savory recipes for millet: Toasted millet tabouli: Toast grains in a sauté pan until light golden brown. Cook with water or stock. Fluff with a fork. Add diced tomato, cucumber, onion, chopped fresh mint, oregano, and parsley. Mix with olive oil and season.

443,443,https://www.who.int/news/item/02-03-2022-who-releases-new-standard-to-tackle-rising-threat-of-hearing-loss,WHO releases new standard to tackle rising threat of hearing loss,"Over 1 billion people aged 12 to 35 years risk losing their hearing due to prolonged and excessive exposure to loud music and other recreational sounds. This can have devastating consequences for their physical and mental health, education, and employment prospects.



Ahead of World Hearing Day 2022, under the theme To hear for life, listen with care! WHO has issued a new international standard for safe listening at venues and events. The standard applies to places and activities where amplified music is played.



“Millions of teenagers and young people are at risk of hearing loss due to the unsafe use of personal audio devices and exposure to damaging sound levels at venues such as nightclubs, bars, concerts and sporting events,” said Dr Bente Mikkelsen, WHO Director for the Department for Noncommunicable Diseases.



She added: “The risk is intensified as most audio devices, venues and events do not provide safe listening options and contribute to the risk of hearing loss. The new WHO standard aims to better safeguard young people as they enjoy their leisure activities.”



New recommendations to limit risk of hearing loss



The Global standard for safe listening at venues and events highlights six recommendations for implementation to ensure that venues and events limit the risk of hearing loss to their patrons while preserving high-quality sound and an enjoyable listening experience. The six recommendations are:



(1) a maximum average sound level of 100 decibels

(2) live monitoring and recording of sound levels using calibrated equipment by designated staff

(3) optimizing venue acoustics and sound systems to ensure enjoyable sound quality and safe listening

(4) making personal hearing protection available to audiences including instructions on use

(5) access to quiet zones for people to rest their ears and decrease the risk of hearing damage; and

(6) provision of training and information to staff.



The new standard was developed under WHO’s Make Listening Safe initiative which seeks to improve listening practices especially among young people, drawing on the latest evidence and consultations with a range of stakeholders including experts from WHO, government, industry, consumers, and civil society.



Hearing loss due to loud sounds is permanent but preventable



Exposure to loud sounds causes temporary hearing loss or tinnitus. But prolonged or repeated exposure can lead to permanent hearing damage, resulting in irreversible hearing loss. Young people can better protect their hearing by:

keeping the volume down on personal audio devices

using well-fitted, and if possible, noise-cancelling earphones/headphones

wearing earplugs at noisy venues

getting regular hearing check-ups

Advocating for the new global standard



WHO encourages governments to develop and enforce legislation for safe listening and raise awareness of the risks of hearing loss. The private sector should include WHO’s recommendations for safe listening features in their products, venues, and events. To motivate behaviour change, civil society organizations, parents, teachers, and physicians can educate young people to practice safe listening habits.



“Governments, civil society and private sector entities such as manufacturers of personal audio devices, sound systems, and video gaming equipment as well as owners and managers of entertainment venues and events have an important role to play in advocating for the new global standard,” said Dr Ren Minghui, WHO Assistant Director-General. “We must work together to promote safe listening practices, especially among young people.”



Note to editors

As a postdoc at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard in 2008, cancer biologist Ravid Straussman worked on a collaborative effort to screen normal cells for their influence on cancer cells’ responses to various anticancer therapies. The project turned up hundreds of examples of stromal cells—best known for forming the connective tissues that support organs—somehow conferring drug resistance on their cancerous neighbors in vitro. One of these cases caught Straussman’s attention: human pancreatic and colorectal cancer cell lines could evade the chemotherapeutic drug gemcitabine when cultured with dermal fibroblasts.

In the lab, the cancer cells “continue to proliferate under therapy,” Straussman explains. “This was really fascinating to me because I didn’t understand . . . how stromal cells can protect cancer cells from chemotherapy.”

He spent the next year and a half trying to figure out what was going on. He ruled out several hypotheses, including that the stromal cells were secreting a protective protein or exosome. “We had tons of ideas that turned out to be not true,” Straussman says. Then, he discovered that the fibroblasts he and his colleagues had been using contained bacteria called Mycoplasma, a common contaminant of tissue and cell cultures. “I was devastated at the time,” he recalls—in presentations, he has used a photo of a wrecked sedan to depict his reaction to the discovery. “I spent a year and a half, probably, tracing this, and this is a complete artifact.” He almost trashed the whole project.

“But then I got curious.”

In subsequent experiments, Straussman confirmed that it was the bacteria that were rescuing the cancer cells from chemotherapy: when he treated the fibroblasts with an antibiotic, they no longer protected cancer cells from gemcitabine, and when he infected other stromal cells with Mycoplasma, it endowed them with the ability to shield cancer cells from the drug. “So we know for a fact it wasn’t the stromal cells that rescued the cancer cells from chemotherapy, but actually it was the Mycoplasma that did that.”

A CLOSER LOOK: Ravid Straussman of Weizmann Institute of Science has found evidence of bacteria inside tumor cells, such as these human pancreatic cells, which harbor GFP-positive bacteria. Left: Picture by Larry Luxner; Right: Picture by Leore Geller from the Straussman lab

The question remained whether such bacteria are naturally present in cancer. Contrary to the common dogma at the time that tumors were sterile, Straussman says he wondered if the cancerous growths could in fact be hosting microbial life, like so many tissues in the human body that modern genomic tools had revealed to harbor their own microbiomes. Gemcitabine was then a first-line treatment for pancreatic cancer, and is still commonly used. “If there are bacteria in pancreatic cancer and bacteria do such a beautiful trick, this can be really interesting.”

When Straussman accepted a faculty position at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel in 2013, he decided to pursue this line of research. Along with Weizmann colleagues and collaborators back at the Broad, Straussman sequenced samples from 113 human pancreatic cancers and scoured the results for bacterial DNA. Sure enough, the researchers found genetic signatures of bacteria in 76 percent of them. “We never found Mycoplasma in pancreatic cancer, but we found many other bacteria,” says Straussman, “and we found that [when] we isolated these bacteria from tumors, they can also rescue cancer cells from chemotherapy” in vitro.

Everything that has to do with tumor biology can now be reexamined. There's endless directions in which we can go. —Ravid Straussman, Weizmann Institute of Science

The next piece of the puzzle, then, was how. Further research showed that bacteria lived inside the cancer cells near the nuclear envelope. There, they would take up gemcitabine before it could reach the cell’s genome and they’d cleave an amine group from the drug, effectively deactivating it. The findings were so unexpected that it took one of the group’s own technicians more than a year to be convinced of their validity, notes Straussman, who has since filed for a few patents related to the presence of bacteria in tumors. When the team published its work in Science in September 2017, it was one of the first conclusive demonstrations that a tumor outside the gut had bacteria living within it.

While the thinking at the time was that cancers were generally germ-free tissues, there had long been reports of microbes in tumors. The problem was that contamination could not be ruled out in most cases. But in the less than five years since Straussman and his team revealed those findings, the evidence for the idea has exploded as various groups have carefully documented the presence of cancer type–specific microbial communities. There have been “literally dozens of other papers,” says microbiome researcher Rob Knight of the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), and these have provided “plenty of evidence that tumors do have their own microbiome.” Indeed, this January, Douglas Hanahan of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne added “polymorphic microbiomes” to the famous list of cancer hallmarks, noting that “while the gut microbiome has been the pioneer of this new frontier, multiple tissues and organs have associated microbiomes.”

Researchers are moving quickly to turn these discoveries into clinically useful tools. The mere presence of microbes in tumors could provide a conceptual basis for new cancer diagnostics, and Knight recently cofounded Micronoma, a company that aims to develop such tests based on bacterial nucleic acid signatures in the blood. Researchers are also exploring the possibility of manipulating the tumor microbiome to treat cancer, and Straussman says he is now in the process of launching a new company, Baccine, to do just that. (He also consults for Biomica, which is focused on gut microbiome–based therapeutics for a range of diseases, including cancer.)

But while some scientists are already looking toward potential clinical applications, many basics of tumor microbiome biology remain unresolved. Some of the most pressing questions pertain to whether and how microbes are influencing the development and progression of cancer, as well as patients’ responses to therapy. “There is a lot of fundamental biology that is yet to be discovered,” says Micronoma cofounder and executive Greg Sepich-Poore, a recent PhD graduate from Knight’s group.

“Describing the presence of these bacteria and viruses, it’s only step one,” agrees virologist Nadim Ajami, director of scientific research for MD Anderson’s Program for Innovative Microbiome and Translational Research (PRIME TR), an effort focused on interrogating microbe-host interactions in cancer. “What we’re really after is [understanding] their role [in the] onset of cancer, progression of disease, response to therapy, with an eye on how can we use all that information to perhaps prevent the development of cancer or increase therapy efficacy.”

See “Microbes Meet Cancer”

Tumors are melting pots

The overturning of the tumors-are-sterile dogma is thanks in large part to the development of next-gen sequencing and the curation of massive data sets of cancer genomes. As MD Anderson’s Jennifer Wargo explains, “Whenever you do whole-genome sequencing, not only do you get human reads, you also get microbial reads. . . . Rather than [filtering] microbes out, we can actually get a lot of clarity about what microbes are there [and] what function do they have.”

“But,” adds Wargo, who started PRIME TR, “there’s a lot of complexity because any time these tissues were collected, it wasn’t necessarily for the sole intent of looking at microbes, and so they may have been collected in a way that really complicates that. There could be a lot of contaminants.”

MICROBIAL GLOW: Bacterial RNA (orange) in human ovarian tumor (nuclei in blue) Picture by Deborah Nejman from the Straussman lab

This is a particular challenge because the microbial communities found in tumors are relatively small—bacteria are far less abundant than in the gut, for instance. Such low-biomass samples, as they’re called, are highly sensitive to contamination, which, according to Straussman, is entirely unavoidable. “A few years ago, we went into a lot of hassle trying to just clean everything completely . . . [and] we found out we just cannot do it,” he says. “There’s always some bacterial DNA contamination.”

So when he, Wargo, and their colleagues decided to survey 1,526 samples of seven different tumor types—including breast, lung, pancreatic, and brain—to rigorously address the question of whether bacteria were commonplace in cancer, they needed to control for this inevitability. They did so by incorporating negative controls in each step of the process, including extracting the DNA, cycling the samples through PCR, and sequencing the resulting nucleic acids. They even took bits of the paraffin block that the tumor tissue was preserved in, to control for contaminants introduced when the samples were first taken. “So at the end of the day,” Straussman says, “we know what the background noise is and what [are] the true sequences that are coming from the tumor.”

After eliminating more than 90 percent of the reads based on these controls, the group was able to identify a distinct bacterial signature for each tumor type, with breast cancer exhibiting a particularly abundant and diverse microbiome. Then, to ascertain if the bacteria were actually living within the tumors, the team cultured tumor slices and treated them with a fluorescently stained enantiomer of the amino acid alanine, which bacteria incorporate into their cell walls. When they saw the glow of the bacteria under the microscope, it was “nice proof of the fact that live bacteria are present in these tumors,” says Straussman.

The results, published in Science in May 2020, took “another step further into the right direction, which is they did not only rely on bioinformatics tools to determine the presence of these bacterial signals; they coupled that with imaging,” says Ajami, who consults or advises for a few biotech companies involved in microbiome research and development. “So they were able to identify intratumoral bacteria—and in some cases, intracellular bacteria—that were present in these tumors.” For good measure, Straussman’s team cultured bacteria from breast tumor samples taken from five women undergoing surgery and was able to cultivate hundreds of colonies, including members of three main phyla, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria (recently renamed Pseudomonadota, Bacillota, and Actinomycetota).

Straussman is not alone in his mission to document and interrogate microbiomes in tumors. More and more studies present new data and novel approaches to help propel the conversation beyond potential contamination concerns. Margaret Sällberg Chen, a clinical immunologist and cancer microbiome researcher at the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden, worked with physicians there to sample bacteria from precancerous pancreatic cysts—in which they’d previously identified bacterial DNA—in the operating room. “When they lifted out the pancreas, they could take the sample and inoculate it directly to the culture medium,” she explains. The work, published in November 2021, resulted in successful cultures of Enterococcus, Enterobacter, and Klebsiella bacteria, among other groups. Because some of these species die upon exposure to oxygen, time was of the essence when sampling the tumors and preserving their microbial communities, says Sällberg Chen. “By having this very fast culturing method, we succeeded to cultivate some of the pancreas microbiome.”

While much more research is needed to pin down the function of microbes in cancer, researchers who spoke with The Scientist agree that the evidence all points to the idea that tumors are indeed not sterile, but typically harbor a microbiome. “The bottom line is, yes,” says Straussman, “there’s actually live bacteria in tumors.”

MICROBIAL SIGNATURES OF CANCER In the past few years, researchers have published dozens of studies documenting the presence of bacteria and other microbes in the tumors, gut, and blood of patients with cancer. Multiple groups have uncovered preliminary correlations between microbial signatures in these tissues and a patient’s diagnosis, prognosis, or response to treatment, which could one day help inform clinical care.

Microbial diagnostics

Straussman’s 2020 Science paper came on the heels of somewhat similar study, published in Nature by Knight’s group. Like Straussman’s team, Knight and his colleagues had surveyed a range of tumor types and discarded up to nearly 93 percent of the sequence data from their analyses to guard against contamination. And like Straussman’s findings, Knight’s results had showcased microbes as common features of cancer, with microbial makeup varying by cancer type. But the UCSD team had taken an entirely different approach—clean and analyze existing sequence data rather than sequence samples anew—and they had come to the idea for very personal reasons.

Sepich-Poore was a freshman in college when his grandmother was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer the day after Christmas 2012. By the end of January, she had died from the disease. When the doctors were unable to explain why the cancer hadn’t been detected sooner, why it had progressed so quickly, and why it hadn’t responded to therapy, Sepich-Poore decided to go looking for answers himself. He taught himself bioinformatics and machine learning to interrogate how cancers evolve over time. He later began reading the literature on blood-based diagnostics, searching for new strategies in cancer screening and testing. And in 2016, he enrolled in medical school at UCSD, eager to learn about new advances in pancreatic cancer diagnosis and treatment.

Unfortunately, he found that despite the massive genomics revolution that had occurred in recent years, not much progress had been made for patients with pancreatic cancer. The five-year survival rate for the disease has lingered at around 10 or 11 percent for decades. “It made me wonder [if] perhaps there are markers or entities that are not yet being accounted for by those focused on host DNA or host RNA or host proteins,” but which could help catch cancer earlier, notes Sepich-Poore. Then he came across Straussman’s 2017 paper showing that not only did bacteria exist in the tumor microenvironment, they could influence the cancer’s response to therapy. He recalls being stunned.

Sepich-Poore suspected that no tumors were actually sterile, and that the microbes present could provide critical information. He had spent some time in Knight’s lab the summer before starting med school, and he landed back there for his PhD, spending his first six months interrogating whole genome sequences and transcriptomic data that was gathered as part of The Cancer Genome Atlas. His analysis covered the tissue and blood samples of more than 10,000 patients with more than 30 cancer types.

At first blush, the data were disappointing, Knight explains, as most of the variation the researchers found in microbial DNA could be attributed to where the study had been done. But Sepich-Poore applied statistical approaches he’d used to account for batch effects when analyzing human cancer data and “was able to get rid of all that noise and see a signal where the bacteria in a particular sample can give a readout of what kind of tumor you have and what stage,” Knight explains. Then, to scrub the data of potentially contaminating bacteria, Sepich-Poore used a series of existing statistical techniques that take into account, for example, the microbial sequences’ relative abundance across samples of different concentrations.

“What we found through this process, which involved running a supercomputer for six months straight, was really surprising,” Sepich-Poore says. “No cancer type was sterile; we were finding microbial DNA and RNA in every [cancer type]. . . . And on top of that, each cancer type has a unique microbiome.” Blood samples taken from cancer patients also had a distinct microbial signature based on cancer type, raising the possibility of minimally invasive diagnostics based on the cancerous tissue’s microbiome.

See “Microbial Signatures in Blood Are Associated with Various Cancers”

Seeing the potential to develop blood-based cancer tests, Knight, Sepich-Poore, and Sandrine Miller-Montgomery, then executive director of UCSD’s Center for Microbiome Innovation, applied for intellectual property to cover the approach and began the process of founding Micronoma. The company incorporated in the summer of 2019 and officially launched in August 2020 (enlisting Straussman and later Wargo to its scientific advisory board and giving them stock options). For its first product, Micronoma is focusing on a test for lung cancer, and collaborations are underway to develop diagnostics for other cancer types, says Miller-Montgomery, now CEO and president of the company. “The goal is to put this in the hands of clinicians and in the hands of patients.” In December, Sepich-Poore defended his dissertation and officially joined Micronoma full-time as its chief analytics officer.

Already, other labs have started to generate findings that support the idea that microbes could aid in cancer diagnosis. Last summer, for example, researchers reported that they’d identified microbial DNA signatures in the blood of melanoma patients that distinguished them from healthy controls. “We see that as a very important confirmation,” says Knight. It’s especially exciting because melanoma was the cancer type for which their diagnostic algorithms performed the worst, he adds—not terrible, but not as good as the rest. “We’re very encouraged that even in that worst case another group was independently able to see highly significant results.”

Microbial signatures may also contain prognostic information, potentially helping to predict treatment response. In Straussman’s 2020 study, for example, melanoma patients in the data set had different microbial signatures in their tumors if they did or did not respond to immunotherapy. “You can find bacteria that are enriched in responders or nonresponders,” Straussman says. And less than a year earlier, MD Anderson physician-scientist Florencia McAllister, along with Wargo and other colleagues, found that the tumor microbiome could indicate whether patients with pancreatic cancer had lived longer than five years following diagnosis with the disease. “The heterogeneity of microbes in the tumor was higher in the patients that live longer,” says McAllister, who has a patent pending based on the work. The million-dollar question now is what effect bacteria and possibly other microbes have on tumor development, progression, and response to treatment. “It’s one thing to descriptively say these bacteria are present in these tumor types,” says Straussman. “We need to learn more and more about how these bacteria affect the biology of the cancer.”

MICROBE-CANCER INTERACTIONS A growing body of literature suggests that bacteria and other microbes living in tumors or in the guts of cancer patients may influence their responses to

treatment. Conversely, cancer therapies—not to mention diet, medications, and other factors—can affect the body’s microbiota. (Dotted arrows denote unknowns.)

A wide-open field

No one really knows what microbes are doing in cancer, but recent results suggest it’s not nothing. In Sällberg Chen’s study of pancreatic cysts, for example, the researchers suspected the bacteria might be triggering inflammation, as they’d noted high levels of cytokines and other inflammatory markers in the cyst fluid. Sure enough, when the researchers put the bacteria they’d cultured from resected tumors into pancreatic cells in vitro, including both healthy cell lines and those with oncogenic mutations, they saw that some of the microbes caused rampant DNA damage and eventually cell death. “Some of them didn’t do so much really, but some of them were kind of vicious,” says Sällberg Chen. “Some of these bacteria that are hiding inside the pancreas are probably not very good. If they are hiding there for a long time, it will probably help [cancer] to develop.”

The million-dollar question now is what effect bacteria and possibly other microbes have on tumor development, progression, and response to treatment.

Researchers are also looking at how the immune system responds to bacteria in tumors. In collaboration with Wargo and others, for example, Straussman and his Weizmann colleague Yardena Samuels found T cells that presented peptides derived from microbes identified in the tumors. “This means that in a way our immune system really sees these bacteria,” says Straussman. Ajami, who was not involved in the study, agrees. “We now know they’re not only there, but they’re being detected and processed by the immune system.” These results point to a potential mechanism by which the microbiome could affect patients’ responses to therapy, Knight adds.

A handful of recent retrospective studies showing that taking antibiotics is associated with responses to both immunotherapies and to chemotherapies such as gemcitabine further support the importance of the microbiome in cancer outcomes, and the nature of the effect appears to vary by cancer type. “Antibiotics seem to have beneficial effects in patients with pancreatic cancer, whereas in melanoma, antibiotics seem to have a deleterious role,” Straussman says. Indeed, researchers studying tumor microbiomes are acutely aware that bacteria are not always bad. “With the microbiome it’s a yin-yang,” says McAllister. “It’s not going to be a one-size-fits-all.”

See “How the Microbiome Influences Drug Action”

A limitation of these studies, however, is that the effects may not necessarily have to do with resultant changes in the tumor microbiome, as the gut microbiome will also be affected by antibiotic use. “The role of the tumor microbiome independently of the gut microbiome is a very important question,” says McAllister. “Most of the time when we are modulating the tumor microbiome, we are modulating the gut as well.”

Indeed, when she and her colleagues took bacteria from pancreatic cancer patients and gave them orally to antibiotic-treated mice, they changed the composition of the gut microbiome first and foremost. That said, the researchers did see notable shifts in the tumor microbiome as well, including increases in bacteria that were enriched in the patients’ tumors. “This data suggests that the gut microbiome can modulate the tumor microbiome, in minor part by direct translocation into the tumors, but more significantly, by altering the microbial landscape,” the authors write in their paper. (See “Where Does the Tumor Microbiome Come From?” below.) And the outcome was significant: animals who’d received microbiome transplants from long-term survivors had slower-growing tumors than did mice who’d gotten transplants from short-term survivors, suggesting a potential protective effect of the bacteria.

Two studies by separate groups published in the same issue of Science last year tested the concept of fecal transplants for modulating response to cancer therapy in humans. These trials showed that metastatic melanoma patients treated with fecal microbiota transplants from a treatment-responding donor had improved responses to the same checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy the donor had received. Using fecal transplant to turn a nonresponder into a responder is “an amazing event,” says Knight. Although in this case the research focused on manipulating the gut microbiome, he adds, “it might be possible to modify what’s in the tumor by modifying what’s in the gut.”

Another possibility researchers are pursuing is the use of bacteria themselves as cancer therapeutics. Indeed, scientists have for years been working to engineer bacteria to seek and destroy cancer. “Now, the more we know about the bacteria [that] are found in tumors, probably we can use this as a new modality of treating cancer,” says Straussman.

See “Bacteria as Living Microrobots to Fight Cancer”

To be able to fully harness the power of bacteria and other microbes to treat cancer, researchers need to better understand the relationship between the two. The list of outstanding questions goes on and on: How stable is the tumor microbiome? How does it interact with the gut microbiome? How have the bacteria in tumors evolved in the unique microenvironment? And that’s just the microbiology side; then there’s the cancer side. What role are the microbes playing in clonal evolution, metastasis, response to therapy, the immune landscape, and so on?

“And this is a short list. . . . Everything that has to do with tumor biology can now be reexamined,” says Straussman, who says he appreciates the collaborative spirit of the small but growing field. “There’s endless directions in which we can go.”","how stromal cells can protect cancer cells from chemotherapy.”He spent the next year and a half trying to figure out what was going on.
But while some scientists are already looking toward potential clinical applications, many basics of tumor microbiome biology remain unresolved.

445,445,https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ice-fish-nest-antarctica-breeding-colony-largest-group,The largest group of nesting fish ever found lives beneath Antarctic ice,"Five hundred meters below the ice covering Antarctica’s Weddell Sea sits the world’s largest known colony of breeding fish, a new study finds.

An estimated 60 million active nests of a type of icefish stretch across at least 240 square kilometers, nearly the size of Orlando, Fla. Many fish create nests, from freshwater cichlids to artistically inclined pufferfish (SN: 10/13/20). But until now, researchers have encountered only a handful of icefish nests at a time, or perhaps several dozen. Even the most gregarious nest-building fish species were previously known to gather only in the hundreds.

The icefish probably have a substantial and previously unknown influence on Antarctic food webs, researchers report January 13 in Current Biology.

Deep sea biologist Autun Purser of the Alfred Wegener Institute in Bremerhaven, Germany, and colleagues stumbled across the massive colony in early 2021 while on a research cruise in the Weddell Sea, which is located between the Antarctic Peninsula and the main continent.

The researchers were studying chemical connections between surface waters and the seafloor. Part of the research involved surveying seafloor life by slowly towing a device behind the scientists’ icebreaking research vessel. That device recorded video as it glides just above the bottom of the ocean and used sound to map seafloor features.

At one location on the Filchner ice shelf in the Weddell Sea, one of Purser’s colleagues was operating the camera tow and noticed that it kept encountering circular Jonah’s icefish (Neopagetopsis ionah) nests down below. Icefish, of the family Channichthyidae, are only found in the Southern Ocean and Antarctic waters and have strange adaptations to the extreme cold such as clear blood full of antifreeze compounds (SN: 9/19/98).

“When I came down half an hour later and just saw nest after nest the whole four hours of the first dive, I thought we were onto something unusual,” Purser recounts.

Purser and colleagues made three more surveys in the area and continued to find nests at a similar density, kilometer after kilometer. Perhaps one of the closest comparisons to icefish among nest-spawning fish are bluegills (Lepomis macrochirus), which form breeding colonies that can have hundreds of individuals, Purser says. But based on measurements showing about one icefish nest per four square meters across hundreds of kilometers of territory, the Weddell Sea colony is several orders of magnitude larger, the researchers say.

Video and acoustic surveys recently revealed that a type of Antarctic fish called Jonah’s icefish gather to breed in the millions, making a field of circular nests that stretches for kilometers. Alfred Wegener Institute, PS124 OFOBS team

The colony is an “amazing discovery,” says evolutionary biologist Thomas Desvignes of the University of Oregon in Eugene, who was not involved in the research. He was especially struck by the extreme concentration of nests.

“It made me think of bird nests,” Desvignes says. “When we see cormorants and other marine birds that nest like that, one next to the other — it’s almost like that.”

It’s not clear why so many icefish are gathering in one spot to breed. There appears to be good access to plankton in this location, which would be a crucial food source for newly hatched fish. The team also found a zone with slightly warmer water in the area, which could help the icefish locate the breeding ground.

The icefish could be sustaining Weddell seals, the researchers say. Prior studies have shown the seals spending a lot of time diving in waters above the colony area.

Purser thinks that there may be smaller Jonah’s icefish colonies closer to shore where there is less ice cover. It is possible, though, that the Jonah’s icefish disproportionately rely on the massive breeding colony, effectively putting all their eggs in one basket. If so, that “would make the species extremely vulnerable” to extinction, Desvignes says. The discovery of the massive colony is one more argument for providing environmental protections for the Weddell Sea as has been done for the nearby Ross Sea, he says.

For now, Purser currently has two seafloor cameras at the colony site, where they will remain for a couple of years, taking photos four times a day to see if the nests are reused over time.

“I would say [the massive colony] is almost a new seafloor ecosystem type,” Purser says. “It’s really surprising that it has never been seen before.”","Five hundred meters below the ice covering Antarctica’s Weddell Sea sits the world’s largest known colony of breeding fish, a new study finds.

A new study takes a close look at the incidence of heart problems after COVID-19.

The researchers find evidence of a wide range of heart issues for up to 1 year after recovery.

Experts recommend that people who have had COVID-19 remain alert for symptoms of heart issues, promptly consulting a doctor if these occur.

All data and statistics are based on publicly available data at the time of publication. Some information may be out of date. Visit our coronavirus hub for the most recent information on the COVID-19 pandemic. Was this helpful?

Scientists are confident that COVID-19 can cause heart damage. Based on an analysis of national healthcare databases from the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, a new study offers a more detailed look at common post-COVID-19 cardiac issues.

The study found that people who have recovered from COVID-19 are at an elevated risk of developing heart problems within the first year after the disease.

University of California, Los Angeles cardiologist Dr. Gregg C. Fonarow — who was not involved in the study — told Medical News Today, “There was a large spectrum of cardiovascular injury and risks documented.”

The study comes from researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and the Veterans Affairs (VA) St. Louis Health Care System.

The senior investigator is Dr. Ziyad Al-Aly, chief of research and development service at the VA St. Louis Health Care System and clinical epidemiologist at Washington University.

“What we’re seeing isn’t good,” Dr. Al-Aly says. “COVID-19 can lead to serious cardiovascular complications and death. The heart does not regenerate or easily mend after heart damage. These are diseases that will affect people for a lifetime.”

Dr. Richard C. Becker, director of and physician-in-chief at the University of Cincinnati Heart, Lung and Vascular Institute — also not involved in the study — told MNT:

“The observations from the [VA Health System] underscore what is less well appreciated in both the medical community and lay community — that is, the long-term cardiovascular effects that can be serious and even life threatening. The important message is ‘awareness’ and having a well-established follow-up plan in place.”","Share on Pinterest How does COVID-19 affect the heart in the long run?

Transcript Close

President Jim Ryan 0:01

Now you said that twice, where it's the students who make all the discoveries, which just I have to ask you, so what's your job then?

Dr. Bill Petri 0:10

No, no, that's quite true. And we're really what I tried to do is to provide the resources, bring a group of people together that each knows how to do different things, and help them to interact and promote that interaction and then kind of stand out of the way. Research really goes from the bottom up.

President Jim Ryan 0:32

Hi, everyone, I'm Jim Ryan, the president of the University of Virginia and I'd like to welcome all of you to the latest episode of Inside UVA. This podcast is a chance for me to speak with some of the amazing people at the university, and to learn more about what they do and who they are. My hope is that listeners will ultimately have a better understanding of how UVA works and a deeper appreciation of the remarkably talented and dedicated people who make UVA the institution it is. Today's guest is Dr. Bill Petri, Vice Chair for Research in the UVA Department of Medicine, a chair professor of infectious disease and international health, and the head of the Petri Lab. Bill, it's a real honor to have you here.

Dr. Bill Petri 1:13

Jim, thank you so much for having me, I'm really excited to get a chance to talk with you.

President Jim Ryan 1:18

So you are a world renowned infectious disease expert with over 400 publications and 20 patents. You are the recipient, rightly so, of numerous accolades, including inclusion in multiple medical honor societies, and the Thomas Jefferson Award for Excellence in Scholarship, which is the highest award given to UVA faculty. You have made significant contributions to global health, which has meant traveling the globe in order to do your research. You've been a mentor to many, you are a husband and proud father of five children, you play the trombone, and you run marathons. So my first quick question is, how in the world do you do all of this?

Dr. Bill Petri 2:01

Everything is fun. And so when you get to work with UVA students, discover new things, go running, raise a family in a beautiful community like Charlottesville, it all works.

President Jim Ryan 2:16

Well, I think you may be superhuman too, which probably helps. So I'm curious to go back to the beginning. I mean, you have had a truly remarkable career. How did you get started? And how did you get interested in the field of research that you've been pursuing for decades now?

Dr. Bill Petri 2:35

I think I've always wanted to be a scientist; like I was in elementary school during the race to the moon and my godfather was actually the press officer for NASA. So I got to meet Scott Carpenter. And my father was a chemical engineer. And so I always knew I wanted to be a scientist. And then there was a wonderful program at NIH that put high school students into the labs at NIH. And my older sister did that, then I did it, my younger sister did that. And all three of us now are physician scientists. And so we learned that we both wanted to be doctors and care for people, and also do science. And so it was really a remarkable opportunity for high school students.

President Jim Ryan 3:18

So where did you grow up? Did you grew up near NIH?

Dr. Bill Petri 3:21

Yeah, we grew up in DC. Yeah, yeah. So just in the Chevy Chase part of Washington.

President Jim Ryan 3:27

And then how about your particular fields? I mean, you could have studied any number of things. How did you get interested in the topics that you study?

Dr. Bill Petri 3:37

Well, in medical school, one of my professors was Dick Grant, who's still here on faculty. And Dick lectured as his first year medical students about how important infectious diseases were in low and middle income countries. And I was sold on the spot, and he's still doing doing what he told us about 40 years ago.

President Jim Ryan 4:00

And it's been an interesting field to be in lately.

Dr. Bill Petri 4:03

For sure, yeah. It's been very fulfilling to be able to try to contribute something back with a pandemic.

President Jim Ryan 4:10

Yeah, I want to come back to that. But first I'm curious, a lot of folks I've had on this podcast, I've asked them what led them to UVA. I want to ask you a slightly different question, I mean you have spent, essentially your entire professional career here and have been a professor for more than three decades. What's kept you here?

Dr. Bill Petri 4:33

Jim, it's the students. And I don't know that people outside of science understand that all of the discoveries that are made are made by students and whether that's UVA undergraduates since our medical schools part of the grounds it's easy for them to work in the lab, graduate students, MD fellows, they're the ones that are making the discoveries and that is like so fun because, you know, I'm learning new things, and at the same time, it's creating careers and building young people's futures and then to be able to follow their success, you know, over again, like over 30 years and see them be their own person in science and medicine.

President Jim Ryan 5:14

And what are you working on in the Petri Lab right now?

Dr. Bill Petri 5:18

Well, we have a big effort on making vaccines. And so that includes work on an intranasal vaccine for COVID 19. We're actually in trials in non-human primates of an amebiasis vaccine, which is the parasite that I first started working on 30 years ago at UVA, and then we're actually working on a vaccine against another parasite that's important in children in low income countries called cryptosporidiosis.

President Jim Ryan 5:47

And your work on COVID, you pivoted a bit to focus on COVID when the pandemic hit? And can you talk a little bit about what that looked like?

Dr. Bill Petri 6:00

Sure. What was clear here, like by February of 2020, was the COVID was coming to Charlottesville, it was inevitable. And we were able to set up a study before the first patient ever arrived at UVA Hospital, where we could collect every discarded clinical sample from a COVID patient. And when we get like your blood drawn for a complete blood count, for example, there's always a little bit leftover. And so those discarded samples, we established a bio repository so we could look at how is the immune response different in someone who does well during their hospitalization or who goes on and requires mechanical ventilation. And that was a technician in my lab, Mary Young, who came in every day during the lockdown and went over to the clinical lab and collected these discarded samples. And then, Allie Donlin, at the time, was a graduate student, she was studying another infectious disease with me. And she really courageously dropped what she was doing to work on COVID-19, including working with Barbara Mann and our biosafety level three lab at UVA with a live virus in a mouse model before there was a vaccine. So it was like, you know, a very encouraging time where people really stepping forward to try to make a difference.

President Jim Ryan 7:25

And how unusual is it to see a vaccine developed as quickly as the vaccine for COVID-19 was developed. I mean, you had mentioned that you're working on a vaccine to address a disease that you've been studying for 30 years. I gather, the timeframe here was pretty remarkable.

Dr. Bill Petri 7:51

It's incredibly. I literally am on year 30 of developing an amoebiasis vaccine, which is not unusual. You know, the pace of scientific discovery, and the contribution of science to COVID-19 is something I hope they will all remember 10-20 years from now, you know, that's everyone's investment in supporting research. This is not overnight, but it's 20 years of research on Coronavirus came into play. Even from the original SARS epidemic in 2000, there were things learned about that spike glycoprotein that went into the design of the mRNA vaccines.

President Jim Ryan 8:31

And looking into your crystal ball. You know, we are at least locally, there's a lot of variation across the country and across the globe, obviously. But it looks like we're on the back end of the omicron varia nt. What do you see ahead?

Dr. Bill Petri 8:51

We're going to be at the highest level of immunity in the United States ever, because there's 250 million people who have been vaccinated in the US. 90 million have had COVID-19, unfortunately. And so you add those two numbers together, that's almost everybody in the US has either been exposed or vaccinated. And I think the unknown is like, how long will that immunity last? And will a new variant arise? And, you know, I think there's always the worry of a new variant because it only takes one person for a new variant, you know. The Omicron , as you know, was one person who is chronically infected from 2020 until last November, someone who was immunocompromised that couldn't clear the virus. The same thing with the Alpha variant from the UK was a single individual. So I think that that's always a risk. But I think that we're in for a very good period of time and as we get into the spring just because of the very high levels of immunity.

President Jim Ryan 9:47

Right, right. So let me shift gears a little bit. You talked about the different students who work in your lab and I wonder if this is related to the NIH grants that you've received, the T-32 grants, which you've been involved in for quite some time. And I wonder if you could describe the programs supported by those grants.

Dr. Bill Petri 10:11

Sure thing. So a T-32 is a grant from the NIH that supports training students and fellows, in this case in infectious disease. And the grant that I've been leading since 1996, was actually founded 50 years ago by Jerry Mandell, who was the original head of infectious diseases at UVA, and is really kind of the father of this clinical specialty of infectious disease. And that was really nice, because I didn't have a cold start, I was just like building on something that was already going very well. And the unusual thing about this training program from NIH, or T-32, is that we are training side by side physicians with graduate students. And so we'll have like a research in progress, where a graduate student will present the research and then a physician fellow will or we'll have a journal club. And so that's unusual. And I think that that's really important, because each discipline brings something different to science, that the graduate students are experts in the approaches and understanding mechanisms of disease, the physicians understand, like, need for new knowledge for patients, we don't know like the right thing to do. And so you bring them together, to me that's, that's what drives me, that's what's so rewarding is seeing that work.

President Jim Ryan 11:32

And is that unusual to see that kind of collaboration?

Dr. Bill Petri 11:37

It is, unfortunately, and you know, it's one of the nice things about UVA is that this is a very close knit collaborative community, in research. You know, because lab per lab, we're just as good as any place in the US or in the world for that matter. But we're smaller, and we're close together. And so it's easy like to have students learn new techniques in a colleagues lab or for me to go and learn something.

President Jim Ryan 12:08

So 20 patents. I'm curious about that. And do you have one that you're most proud of, and or that you could explain to us what it does.

Dr. Bill Petri 12:21

Sure. So one that we just filed, just last week, is by a graduate student, David Tyus. And this is a good example of the way things work. So David is a neuroscience graduate student, came to do his PhD with me, because he thought that there's ways that the nervous system connects with the immune system, and that's going to affect susceptibility to infection. And so one of the infections we study is called C. difficile. And David has discovered that the peripheral nervous system is very important in susceptibility, and he's found a single drug that blocks a receptor of the nervous system that can protect against C. difficile. So, it's a neat thing, because it's very, very basic neuroscience applied to an infectious disease, that potentially leads to a new therapy. And most importantly, this is completely David's idea. And this is typical of what goes on in the labs. It's the students and the fellows that come up with the good ideas and the new discoveries.

President Jim Ryan 13:29

So, Bill, you have the gift of being able to translate scientific concepts into language that the rest of us who are not trained scientists can understand. I can see why the Daily Progress has asked you to respond to readers questions about the pandemic. How hard is it to do, that is to translate scientific research into language that non-experts can understand? And how important is it that someone tries to do this?

Dr. Bill Petri 14:07

In a way it's hard, in a way it's easy. It's easy, in that I can understand the science much better than the average person in Charlottesville. It's hard because like to answer, they're really smart questions that I get from the Daily Progress. And so I've got to go into the literature and really understand it so I'm telling people the right thing. And of course, that's one of the beauties of being a professor is that every time you teach, you're learning more than the person that you're teaching. So that's been, it's been a lot of fun being able to participate in like lay education and you think like that, you know, if one person gets vaccinated as a result of something I've written, then that's a huge success.

President Jim Ryan 14:51

Yeah. So you have deep roots in in Charlottesville, and at UVA, I understand that you met your wife at UVA and were married in the chapel.

Dr. Bill Petri 15:02

Yes, it's one of the best decisions I ever made. So yeah, Mary Ann's like incredibly supportive of everything I do. You know and raising five children in Charlottesville is amazing.

President Jim Ryan 15:17

Last question about running. So, talk to us a little bit about your interest in marathoning, why you run, and what's your favorite spot to run in Charlottesville.

Dr. Bill Petri 15:33

Well, as you know, Jim, we all benefit from having Mark Lorenzoni here and the community of runners that he's built. You know, I've gone through the entire COVID with a dear group of friends. We all run together from Green Berry's. We have coffee socially distance outside, like six days a week, graduate students, professors, community people, and so I can't overestimate like the importance of that friendship through running. And to answer your question, my favorite place is out of Green Springs, which is like, you know, this historically preserved 1000 acres with these beautiful farms and you can run for literally for hours and never pass a car. Just gorgeous out there.

President Jim Ryan 16:19

Right. You know I, of all the places I have run, I have yet to get out to Green Springs. But I'm going to put on my list.

Dr. Bill Petri 16:27

Oh, please. Yeah, let me know when you're there. We'll join you. We won't be able to keep up with you. We'll join you.

President Jim Ryan 16:33

I don't know about that. Well, Dr. Petri, thank you so much for your time. It's really been a total pleasure to speak with you.

Dr. Bill Petri 16:42

March 11 (Reuters) - The World Health Organization advised Ukraine to destroy high-threat pathogens housed in the country's public health laboratories to prevent ""any potential spills"" that would spread disease among the population, the agency told Reuters.

Like many other countries, Ukraine has public health laboratories researching how to mitigate the threats of dangerous diseases affecting both animals and humans including, most recently, COVID-19. Its labs have received support from the United States, the European Union and the WHO.

Biosecurity experts say Russia's movement of troops into Ukraine and bombardment of its cities have raised the risk of an escape of disease-causing pathogens, should any of those facilities be damaged.

In response to questions from Reuters about its work with Ukraine ahead of and during Russia's invasion, the WHO said in an email on Thursday that it has collaborated with Ukrainian public health labs for several years to promote security practices that help prevent ""accidental or deliberate release of pathogens.""

""As part of this work, WHO has strongly recommended to the Ministry of Health in Ukraine and other responsible bodies to destroy high-threat pathogens to prevent any potential spills,"" the WHO, a United Nations agency, said.

The WHO would not say when it had made the recommendation nor did it provide specifics about the kinds of pathogens or toxins housed in Ukraine's laboratories. The agency also did not answer questions about whether its recommendations were followed.

Ukrainian officials in Kyiv and at their embassy in Washington did not respond to requests for comment.

Ukraine's laboratory capabilities have been at the center of a growing information war since Russia began moving troops into Ukraine two weeks ago.

On Friday, Russia called a meeting of the 15-member U.N. Security Council to reassert, without providing evidence, a longstanding claim that Ukraine ran biological weapons laboratories with U.S. Defense Department support. read more

The accusation has been repeatedly denied by Ukraine and the United States, where government officials warn Russia may use it as a pretext to deploy its own chemical or biological weapons.

Izumi Nakamitsu, the U.N. High Representative for Disarmament Affairs, told the Security Council on Friday that the United Nations is ""not aware"" of any biological weapons program in Ukraine, which joined an international ban on such arms, as has Russia and the United States along with 180 other countries.

U.N. officials have also said the WHO, in its work with Ukraine, is not aware of any activity in the country that would violate international treaties ""including on chemical weapons or biological weapons.”

The WHO statement to Reuters referred solely to public health laboratories. The agency said it encourages all parties to cooperate in ""the safe and secure disposal of any pathogens they come across, and to reach out for technical assistance as needed."" It offered to help wherever possible with technical guidance and coordination.

This project will support provider engagement, strategic planning, and public awareness of risk reduction, early diagnosis, and treatment. TDH is one of 16 public health departments awarded this capacity-building opportunity under the Building Our Largest Dementia (BOLD) Infrastructure for Alzheimer's Act.

""Approximately 120,000 Tennesseans are living with Alzheimer's disease, and an estimated 357,000 caregivers in the state are providing millions of hours in care per year,"" said TDH Deputy Medical Director, Division of Family Health and Wellness Dr. Denise Werner. ""Our goal is to help Tennesseans understand how to reduce their risks of developing dementia and where to turn if they, or their family members, are showing signs of memory loss.""



Dementia is a general term for memory loss and decline in other mental functions that interfere with daily life. Alzheimer's disease accounts for 60 to 80 percent of dementia cases. With more than 3,500 deaths per year, Alzheimer's disease is Tennessee's fifth leading cause of death. In addition, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) ranks the state as having the nation's fourth-highest Alzheimer's death rate based on data from 2019.



According to the 2021 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures report, minority communities suffer disproportionately. For example, older African Americans are twice as likely to be diagnosed with Alzheimer's. Older Hispanics are 1.5 times more likely to be diagnosed with the disease than older non- Hispanic whites.



TDH is creating an awareness campaign for Alzheimer's disease with the funding awarded from the BOLD program. The department is working with statewide partners to expand awareness of Alzheimer's disease, including warning signs, seeking a diagnosis, and lifestyle habits that can help keep your body and brain healthy while reducing your risk of memory loss. The campaign will also encourage patients and caregivers to engage with a primary care provider to screen for dementia and share resources, including the importance of advance care planning with their patients and caregivers.

On Monday night, councillors will hear a task force presentation on the future of the transit hub and surrounding lands near Barrie's waterfront.

The task force recommends building a 10,000 square foot structure to house the Barrie Farmers' Market, which runs weekly in the City Hall rotunda in the colder months, and just outside its doors when it's warmer.

The farmers' market would be located where the bus platforms currently sit.

It's a space task force chair and deputy mayor Barry Ward imagines being used for music and street performers.

The task force proposes to renovate the existing transit hub, making it a permanent market with businesses like bakeries, fishmongers, and coffee shops as tenants.

The mayor sees the terminal's position between the waterfront and downtown as ideal for people who live in the city and those just stopping by the water.

""These markets are such a wonderful draw,"" says Jeff Lehman. ""It's a great reason for them to come up into the west end of our downtown.""

Howard Kerry hopes the market will entice more curious readers to Kerry's Book Store.

Meanwhile, there's a sense of hope and opportunity down the street at Bill Le Boeuf.

""A farmers' market downtown is going to bring new people, new families. It's going to enhance the community of downtown. And that's really what we need downtown is a community,"" says owner Adam Le Boeuf.

Councillors are expected to vote Monday on taking on the next steps like hiring a consultant, drafting a business plan and applying for grants.

While no formal design has been finalized, Ward estimates the project would cost about $10 million. He says the city hopes to get support from provincial and federal governments for the project.

Discussion of the market district also includes the possibility of converting some waterfront parking back to park land and consulting with Indigenous communities about how best to use the area around the Spirit Catcher to serve reconciliation.","The task force recommends building a 10,000 square foot structure to house the Barrie Farmers' Market, which runs weekly in the City Hall rotunda in the colder months, and just outside its doors when it's warmer.

Here’s how to avoid Lyme disease.,"Our nonprofit news organization is made possible by subscribers and donors who value storytelling that impacts and uplifts communities. Thank you for supporting our journalism.

Ah, spring. The season of daffodils, new beginnings, and the emergence of everyone’s favorite blood-sucking arachnid, the tick — just waiting for the chance to gorge itself as you engage in your favorite outdoor activities.

As if hacking into tender human flesh with its harpoon mouth wasn’t enough, the scourge of the spider family can also transmit Lyme disease and other illnesses. If not treated, Lyme can cause serious or even life-threatening complications down the road, and chronic symptoms can sometimes linger even with treatment.

Incidences of Lyme disease have nearly doubled in the U.S. over the last three decades, due to changes in climate and land use patterns, as well as globalization.

The Banner spoke with Dr. John Aucott, director of the Lyme Disease Research Center at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, about what Lyme is, how it spreads, and how to protect yourself.

The conversation has been edited for brevity and clarity.

Banner: What is Lyme disease, and how does it affect the body?

Aucott: Lyme is an infectious disease that’s caused by the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected deer tick. The bite often, but not always, causes a round, red skin lesion to form. In more than half of people who are infected, if they aren’t treated at that early stage, the bacteria will spread and can cause later infections of other organs, notably the heart, the nervous system, and the joints.

In what types of environments are people most likely to contract Lyme disease, and what are the best prevention strategies they can use?

Unfortunately, Baltimore and the counties surrounding it are high-risk areas for Lyme transmission because we have green spaces that support deer and ticks and mice, which carry the infection, with people living, gardening, or recreating in those areas. This includes areas in the city limits where there’s streams and greenways, and definitely outside the city in reservoir and hiking areas.

Most Lyme disease is actually transmitted in your own backyard, in the woods outside of your lawn. Gardening in the springtime is the classic time to get tick bites because you’re out cleaning brush at the edge of your lot, and that’s where the ticks live.

The way to prevent it is to dress appropriately, which includes wearing long pants with shoes and socks, and the clothing can be treated with a chemical called permethrin, which you can buy in sports stores. You can also use compounds on your skin: The best-known one is DEET, but there’s others you can find on the CDC website.

After gardening or hiking, take a shower while looking and feeling for ticks. Nymph-stage or adolescent ticks are the size of a poppy seed, so they’re hard to see. It can be easier to find them by feeling for them in areas where they like to attach, like behind your knee or in the groin, armpit or other areas that you may not be able to see. If you remove the tick quickly, it dramatically lowers the risk of transmitting the bacteria.

During what times of year are people most at risk of getting infected?

Nymph-stage ticks come out in late spring and early summer, and peak months are always June and July. There’s a second small peak in fall when the adult-stage ticks are feeding and people are spending time outside. Transmission dips in August when it’s really hot and both people and ticks aren’t out as much, and then it dips a lot after it gets really cold because adult ticks won’t feed when the temperature is below 40°. But with warming climates we actually do see tick bites in winter if the temperature is above 40 degrees.

What symptoms of Lyme should people watch for?

Acute Lyme disease has an incubation period of a couple weeks, so it occurs about 1-3 weeks after the tick bite. People should be looking for that round, red skin lesion, and one of the huge take-home points I always tell people is it usually doesn’t look like a target — like the side of a Target department store. That classic bull’s-eye shape only appears in 20% of the skin lesions. The majority are actually just round and red, and they’re commonly mistaken for a bug or spider bite.

People miss the opportunity to get a doctor to check it out because they may not have any symptoms. Or they may have symptoms like fever, chills, fatigue and achiness, sort of like the flu, but without the respiratory symptoms. That accompanies a rash a lot of the time, but not always. Sometimes the rash is the only thing that appears in the acute phase in the first several weeks after the tick bites.

What is chronic Lyme?

Chronic Lyme is a misunderstood term, and it’s confusing because an infectious disease doctor defines Lyme disease by its three stages. If the first stage is not treated with antibiotics, a high percentage of people will go on to develop later manifestations of the untreated infection.

The first stage is the rash and other symptoms, like fever. The second stage is a manifestation of ongoing infection when the bacteria spreads to either the heart, the nervous system, or the joints. Rarely, heart involvement can be fatal.

Then, if that stage is not recognized and treated, the third stage occurs an average of six months later. That’s when Lyme arthritis occurs. Lyme disease was actually discovered from an outbreak of Lyme arthritis in kids in a town called Lyme, Connecticut.

All three stages are manifestations of untreated bacterial infection. That’s not what people are usually talking about when they use the words chronic Lyme disease, though — they’re referring to the ongoing symptoms like fatigue, brain fog, and joint pain that can occur months after the initial infection, even when the person has been previously treated.","In what types of environments are people most likely to contract Lyme disease, and what are the best prevention strategies they can use?

Source: IOS Press

The diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease (PD) is currently based on consensus clinical criteria. A novel study reported in the Journal of Parkinson’s Disease has found that the presence of neuronal deposits of the biomarker phosphorylated alpha-synuclein (p-syn) in the brain and the skin of patients with PD distinguishes them from individuals with symptoms of parkinsonism due to the accumulation of another protein, tau.

This development may help the early identification and differential diagnosis of PD among the various parkinsonism subtypes.

The main parkinsonian symptoms are shared with other synucleinopathies, as well as with atypical parkinsonism, including progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal syndrome (CBS), both of which are due to the accumulation of another protein, tau.

Despite the clinical overlap with PD, PSP is characterized by 4-repeat tau deposits, mainly in the basal ganglia, brainstem, and cerebellum, and CBS is a clinical syndrome with a heterogeneous underlying neuropathology, represented mainly by tauopathies but also by synucleinopathies.

“Research in PD and other neurodegenerative disorders is to find treatments able to halt and ideally prevent the accumulation the pathological proteins responsible for the different disorders. Our lab, led by Prof. Rocco Liguori and Dr. Vincenzo Donadio, has spent the last decade looking for reliable biomarkers of PD and related disorders to achieve an accurate and early diagnosis,” explained corresponding author Maria Pia Giannoccaro, PhD, Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna and IRCCS Istituto delle Scienze Neurologiche di Bologna, Bologna, Italy.

“This research sprang from the same effort. Our aim was to see if we could distinguish PD from two potential mimics, PSP and CBS, and to explore the potential for using this approach to support clinical diagnosis,” Dr. Giannoccaro continued.

Investigators recruited 26 patients with PD, 26 patients with either PSP (18) or CBS (8), and 26 healthy individuals from May 2014 to April 2017. All individuals underwent skin biopsy in three sites, the leg, the thigh, and the cervical area, to study p-syn deposits in skin nerves. They found that all except two of the PSP/CBS patients had no skin p-syn deposits, as well as all the healthy individuals. Conversely, all PD patients showed p-syn deposition.

The investigators were surprised by the finding that two patients diagnosed with PSP and CBS, respectively, had p-syn skin deposits. One possibility is that these two patients were misdiagnosed, however, the diagnosis was confirmed by clinical and MRI findings.

Another intriguing possibility is that some patients have a mixed pathology with multiple neurodegenerative disorders occurring at the same time. Both patients had some atypical features more typical of PD that could suggest an atypical synucleinopathy presentation.

“To our knowledge this is the largest study comparing in vivo the peripheral deposition of misfolded alpha-synuclein in PD and PSP/CBS cases,” commented Dr. Giannoccaro.

(A) and a patient with CBS (B). In both cases, most of the PGP9.5-stained fibers demonstrate the presence of p-syn as neuritic inclusions (arrowheads) shown by the merged image (scalebar 50 μM). Credit: Dr. Alex Incensi

“We showed that the presence of skin p-syn deposits accurately distinguishes patients with PD from those with atypical parkinsonism. Early differentiation and accurate in vivo diagnosis are important for adequate clinical management and patient care since the treatment and prognosis of PD, PSP and CBS are different.

The investigators recommend further studies including larger samples of patients to confirm these results. Moreover, in the near future, it could be relevant for the recruitment of patients in clinical trials of potential disease-modifying therapies.

PD is a slowly progressive disorder that affects movement, muscle control, and balance. It is the second most common age-related neurodegenerative disorder affecting about 3% of the population by the age of 65 and up to 5% of individuals over 85 years of age.

“Presence of Skin α-Synuclein Deposits Discriminates Parkinson’s Disease from Progressive Supranuclear Palsy and Corticobasal Syndrome” by Rocco Liguori et al. Journal of Parkinson’s Disease

Abstract

Presence of Skin α-Synuclein Deposits Discriminates Parkinson’s Disease from Progressive Supranuclear Palsy and Corticobasal Syndrome

Background:

Previous studies reported skin phosphorylated α-synuclein (p-syn) deposits in Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients but not in patients with parkinsonism due to tauopathies, although data on the latter are limited.

Objective:

We aimed to assess the presence of skin p-syn deposits in patients with clinical diagnosis of parkinsonism usually due to tauopathy and PD.

Methods:

We consecutively recruited 26 patients, 18 fulfilling clinical diagnostic criteria of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and 8 of corticobasal syndrome (CBS), 26 patients with PD, and 26 healthy controls (HC). All subjects underwent skin biopsy to study p-syn deposits in skin nerves by immunofluorescence.

Results:

Skin p-syn deposits were present in only two of the PSP/CBS patients and none of the HC. Conversely, all PD patients showed p-syn deposition (p < 0.001, Chi-square). The two p-syn positive patients were diagnosed with PSP and CBS, respectively. Although clinical and MRI findings supported these diagnoses, both patients had some atypical features more typical of synucleinopathies.

Conclusion:

The detection of skin p-syn deposits may help in the differential diagnosis of parkinsonism. Indeed, in this study, all PD patients and only two out of 26 with a clinical diagnosis of PSP/CBS had skin p-syn deposits. Furthermore, these two patients showed clinical features that could suggest an atypical synucleinopathy presentation or a mixed pathology.","All individuals underwent skin biopsy in three sites, the leg, the thigh, and the cervical area, to study p-syn deposits in skin nerves.

453,453,https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/communicable-diseases-agency-singapore-pandemic-response-2135256,Why does S'pore need a new Communicable Diseases Agency and what can it do in future pandemics? Experts give their take,"SINGAPORE — The new Communicable Diseases Agency has the potential to not only act as the main liaison with other countries in the event of future pandemics, but also as the central organising agency for the region.

This is what some medical experts envision for the agency, they told TODAY on Wednesday (March 22), a day after Health Minister Ong Ye Kung announced its formation in Parliament during a debate on the Covid-19 White Paper.

The Communicable Diseases Agency will be set up under the Ministry of Health (MOH) to oversee disease preparedness, prevention and control, surveillance, risk assessment and outbreak response, Mr Ong said.

It will consolidate relevant public health functions that now reside in MOH, the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) and the Health Promotion Board.

The National Public Health Laboratory, a department under NCID that investigates outbreaks, will be transferred to the Communicable Diseases Agency, which will also maintain oversight of the clinical facilities in NCID.

Mr Ong added that similar setups are already adopted in other countries such as South Korea, the United Kingdom and the United States.

WHY CREATE A NEW AGENCY?

Would it not be enough to just have NCID in Singapore to deal with future pandemics?

Associate Professor Jeremy Lim, director of global health at the National University of Singapore's Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, pointed out that NCID predominantly serves a clinical services function during a public health crisis.

Otherwise, it focuses on surveillance and policy work, he added.

Infectious disease expert Leong Hoe Nam from Rophi Clinic at Mount Elizabeth Novena Specialist Centre said that although NCID was often sought for medical advice and its knowledge was used in managing outbreaks, its involvement was “primarily consultative in nature”.

TODAY has sought comment from NCID.

Assoc Prof Lim said the Covid-19 pandemic has shown that the “policy response is very tightly coupled to the clinical response”, and therefore, having both clinical and public health functions under one roof would make for “better policy translation”.

On the five points that the Communicable Diseases Agency will consolidate — disease preparedness, prevention and control, surveillance, risk assessment and outbreak response — Dr Paul Tambyah said that they are now overseen by various government ministries and agencies.

Dr Tambyah, president of the Asia Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection, said that the Communicable Diseases Agency can thus serve as a “reference point for all other agencies” that do various parts of outbreak prevention and response.

Professor Dale Fisher, a senior consultant at National University Hospital's division of infectious diseases, anticipates that the Communicable Diseases Agency will ultimately create a more streamlined, efficient and coordinated system.

“(This will) improve our preparedness for outbreaks as well as alerts, early warnings, risk assessment and a prompt response,” he said.

Assoc Prof Lim stressed, though, that the creation of the new agency does not indicate that there was anything wrong with the way Singapore's healthcare systems were organised previously to deal with infectious disease outbreaks. They were appropriate for the time.

""Nobody ever thought there'll be outbreaks on the scale of a global pandemic,"" he said.

""Having learned from Covid that the next outbreak can be very large and move very fast, we do not have the luxury to spread the powers and responsibilities (to deal with the crisis) and hope that when the next pandemic comes, we can hold hands and integrate nicely.""

HOPES FOR THE NEW AGENCY

As Mr Ong did not provide more information about the Communicable Diseases Agency, TODAY has reached out to MOH for more details.

In the absence of such information, the experts have drawn on the experiences of analogous foreign organisations to weigh in on the possible form and function of the new agency.

Assoc Prof Lim said that the “Covid experience” has made it clear that cross-border interactions are important during a global health crisis.

“Like it or not, we should organise in a way that the world organises so that we have (similar) counterparts to make interactions easier,” he added.

Similar agencies to the Communicable Diseases Agency would include the United States’ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, and the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.

If Singapore remains without a similar organisation in the event of a future pandemic, Assoc Prof Lim believes that it could be troublesome for cross-border communication since there will be multiple parties to deal with here.

“The harder it is to interact, the less the interactions will occur,” he added.

In a similar vein, Dr Tambyah hopes that the Communicable Diseases Agency can be the “nucleus for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) CDC or even the Asian CDC” where work can be carried out to target diseases of public health importance for the region.

Dr Tambyah also suggested that the Communicable Diseases Agency could be more effective in managing future pandemics than NCID — if it focuses on areas such as surveillance, public health, education and training, rather than providing clinical care.

He added that the present NCID leadership and staff members are burdened with multiple responsibilities, whereas a specialised approach could help the Communicable Diseases Agency to be more focused.

“Of course, all the medically or nursing qualified public health leaders would need to provide some clinical care in order to ensure that the policies are relevant, meaningful and practical… But this should not be their primary responsibility.”

Dr Tambyah is also of the view that the new agency should not take on a regulatory role, which he said is best left to the ministries.

Separating the two, he said, is invaluable in public health, as illustrated in the case of the surveillance for sexually transmitted infections.

“The Department of Sexually Transmitted Infections Control can honestly tell people that it is not involved in enforcement, so people working illegally in the commercial sex world can safely get treated and contact tracing done without the fear of prosecution,” he said.

“That kind of model could be expanded to other infectious diseases.”","SINGAPORE — The new Communicable Diseases Agency has the potential to not only act as the main liaison with other countries in the event of future pandemics, but also as the central organising agency for the region.
It will consolidate relevant public health functions that now reside in MOH, the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) and the Health Promotion Board.

454,454,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/death-penalty-majority-singapore-residents-support-shanmugam-2535331,Majority of Singapore residents still support death penalty in latest MHA survey: Shanmugam,"MHA also commissioned a separate study in 2021 on people in regions where most of Singapore’s arrested drug traffickers originated from in recent years. Mr Shanmugam did not say which regions these were.

""We wanted to get a sense of what people in these places knew and thought,"" he said.

This study found that:

82 per cent of respondents believed that the death penalty makes people not want to commit serious crimes in Singapore;

69 per cent of respondents believed the death penalty is more effective in discouraging people from committing serious crimes, compared to life imprisonment;

83 per cent of respondents believed that the death penalty makes people not want to traffic substantial amounts of drugs into Singapore.

“I emphasise this: These are the places from which many of our traffickers have come from,” the minister said.

“You remove the death penalty, that number, 83 per cent, will surely be reduced because there is money to be made.

""It’s a fair assumption to say more people will traffic drugs into Singapore, more drugs will enter into Singapore, there will be more drug abusers in Singapore, and more Singaporean families and individuals will be harmed … It's a stark choice for Singaporeans.”

The minister said he has also given instructions for this study to be made public in a way that would not prejudice Singapore's public and foreign policy interests.

Mr Shanmugam cited a 2018 MHA study that he said found a high level of awareness of the death penalty among convicted drug traffickers, and that it influenced their drug trafficking behaviour.

“One of the traffickers in this study said the following: He knew very clearly that if he were caught for trafficking a small amount, he would just go to jail for trafficking. But if he were caught with a larger amount, he would be at risk of the death penalty,” Mr Shanmugam said.

“And so he trafficked below the threshold amount.”

The minister then reiterated how places that have decriminalised drugs or taken a softer stance on them have fared worse, highlighting figures and videos from US cities like Baltimore and San Francisco that showed the spiralling drug situation there.

Given those accounts, he said some will argue that Singapore should retain its tough drug laws but remove the death penalty.

“My response is this: First of all, I gave you the survey results, removing the death penalty and what impact it will have psychologically.

""Second, we have never said that the death penalty alone is sufficient. It is however a key part of our system and approach to deal with drug trafficking. You need many different things to keep Singapore relatively free of drugs.""

These measures, he said, include good intelligence, strong enforcement, stiff punishments, rehabilitation for offenders and deterrence from the death penalty.

“So I'm telling members: We have to think very carefully about this, before removing any part of this framework or going soft,” Mr Shanmugam added.

“Those who advise for removal often compare us with countries that have already lost the drug war. And I'm not sure if they understand the consequences, or choose not to understand them. Because the consequences are plain for everyone to see.”

REHABILITATION OF INMATES

Mr Shanmugam also said that the TAP and Grow initiative, a project by Yellow Ribbon Singapore (YRSG) to create a long-term career pathway for inmates and ex-offenders, will be expanded into the food services sector.

Under this initiative, training academies in prison have been set up in partnership with three sectors: Media, precision engineering and logistics. Inmates will be offered jobs by partner employers upon release.

“About 650 inmates will benefit from the TAP and Grow initiative in these three sectors every year,” Mr Shanmugam said.

YRSG has also developed a new Digital Literacy Masterplan for inmates to gain basic digital skills in prison, so that they are better prepared for the job market upon release. An estimated 750 inmates will be trained in basic digital skills each year, Mr Shanmugam said.

He pointed to how the YRSG has partnered the Infocomm Media Development Authority to roll out digital skills training for older residents at the Selarang Halfway House.

“This training helps with digital services, including government services and financial services,” Mr Shanmugam added.

Beyond working with inmates, YRSG has also put in place a Community Action Masterplan to better harness the skills, strengths and aspirations of its volunteers.

This helps map out opportunities for the community to be involved in giving second chances to ex-offenders, Minister of State for Home Affairs Faishal Ibrahim told Parliament on Thursday.

On the rehabilitation of drug offenders, Associate Professor Faishal said the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) will roll out its Community Supervision Skills initiative progressively, with full implementation islandwide by March next year.

Under this pilot initiative launched in 2019, CNB supervision officers will check in on drug supervisees and assess their residual reintegration needs, such as financial, family and employment needs.

""If necessary, supervisees will be referred to the appropriate agencies for follow up,"" Assoc Prof Faishal said.","“You remove the death penalty, that number, 83 per cent, will surely be reduced because there is money to be made.

Nintedanib slows the rate of forced vital capacity decline in patients with fibrosing autoimmune disease-related interstitial lung disease, with adverse events manageable for most, according to data published in Arthritis & Rheumatology.

“A substantial proportion of patients with systemic autoimmune disease, such as rheumatoid arthritis, dermatomyositis and polymyositis, scleroderma, Sjogren’s syndrome and others, develop various forms of lung involvement that have profound effects on their quality of life and life expectancy,” Eric L. Matteson, MD, of the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science, in Rochester, Minnesota, told Healio. “There is a direct correlation between quality of life and survivorship, and the extent of fibrosis on imaging and loss of pulmonary function.

Nintedanib slows the rate of forced vital capacity decline in patients with fibrosing autoimmune disease-related ILD, with adverse events manageable for most, according to data.

“Recently, antifibrotic therapies have become available for the management of progressive lung fibrosis,” he added. “However, it has not been clear if antifibrotic therapy might also lessen the rate of decline in lung function among patients with progressive autoimmune disease-related interstitial lung disease, for whom good treatment options have not been available.”

To examine the efficacy and safety of nintedanib (Ofev, Boehringer Ingelheim) in patients with progressive fibrosing ILDs related to autoimmune disease, Matteson and colleagues analyzed data from the INBUILD trial. According to the researchers INBUILD was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted across 15 countries in 663 patients with ILDs other than idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Additional eligibility criteria included diffuse fibrosing lung disease of greater than 10% on HRCT, predicted FVC of 45% or greater and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide from 30% to less than 80% predicted.

Eric L. Matteson

Participants were also required to exhibit ILD progression within 24 months prior to screening despite treatment. Patients receiving azathioprine, cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus (Prograf, Astellas Pharma), rituximab (Rituxan, Genentech), cyclophosphamide or more than 20 mg of oral glucocorticoids per day were excluded.

Participants were randomly assigned to receive either 150 mg of nintedanib twice daily or a placebo. After 52 weeks of treatment, participants entered a variable period in which they continued to receive blinded treatment until all had completed the trial.

For this analysis, Matteson and colleagues presented data from the 170 participants with ILD related to autoimmune disease.

According to the researchers, the rate of FVC decline over 52 weeks was –75.9 mL per year in the nintedanib group, compared with –178.6 mL per year among those who received a placebo (difference = 102.7; 95% CI, 23.2-182.2). Additionally, the researchers found no heterogeneity in the effect of nintedanib, compared with placebo, across subgroups by ILD diagnosis (P = .91).

The most frequent adverse event was diarrhea, reported in 63.4% of those treated with nintedanib and in 27.3% of the placebo group. Adverse events led to permanent treatment discontinuation in 17.1% and 10.2% of participants in the nintedanib and placebo groups, respectively.

“We found that nintedanib significantly reduced the rate of decline in forced vial capacity by 58%, and that the effects were very similar to what was seen in subjects who had pulmonary fibrosis not related to an underlying autoimmune disease,” Matteson said. “The frequency of the known side effect of diarrhea was similar in subjects with and without underlying autoimmune disease. The results demonstrate that nintedanib significantly slows the rate of decline in pulmonary function in autoimmune disease-related ILD, a finding that can aid in the management of this complex disease manifestation.”","SaveNintedanib slows FVC decline in autoimmune-related interstitial lung diseaseBy Jason Laday Source/Disclosures Published by: Source: Matteson EL, et al.

We cannot predict exactly what’s ahead, which is why it’s important to follow a healthy lifestyle that minimizes risk of illness and disease.

Eating at certain times of the day can shift the way you feel and live—and that includes preventing or mitigating health issues, from cancer to heart disease to hormonal imbalances. Whether or not you consider yourself high risk for disease, here are tips for making food part of your holistic approach to a long, healthy life.

Cancer in the family

We have all seen—or lived with—the effects of cancer, and have witnessed how it can very quickly or very slowly change our lives. Cancer is a complex disease, and many factors play a role in its development, from genetics to lifestyle choices (smoking and excessive sun are two major ones, of course).

Given all this, though we cannot say that eating certain foods can cure or all-out prevent cancer, certain nutritional steps can help decrease cancer risks. Many foods and nutrients have been linked to lower cancer rates because of the role they play in the body.

In fact, an analysis of research by Cancer Research UK indicates that just a few lifestyle changes—maintaining a healthy body weight, eating a healthy diet, cutting back on alcohol, not smoking, enjoying the sun safely, and keeping active—can prevent four in 10 cancers.

Vegetables, fortified with many good-for-you compounds and nutrients, are nature’s best protective medicine, especially served raw or lightly cooked (sautéed in extra-virgin olive oil is our favorite). Coffee and tea may also be helpful in fending off cancer; both are full of antioxidants, polyphenols, and flavonoids that have been linked with lower risk of the disease.

Red and processed meat (ham, bacon, salami, and sausage), on the other hand, are linked to big-time increases in cancer rates, mostly because of the chemicals they contain, according to scientists.

Fortifying our skeletons

Our movement is a complex orchestra of bones, joints, muscles, tendons, and other soft tissues; our brain is the conductor. Compromises between any of those body parts can play a role in how easily you move, and whether pain is involved.

In addition to holding us up and protecting our vital organs, bones serve vital chemical roles: They store nutrients and help produce blood and stem cells. But bones are built in a honeycomb-like structure (think of the Eiffel Tower) whose density becomes compromised as we age.

Joints, meanwhile, act like door hinges: They allow our bones to move. When joints degenerate, they lose the cushioning—in the form of soft tissue and lubrication—that enables them to glide. The resulting grinding triggers an inflammatory response as the body rushes to heal.

But how does food influence our intricate system of movement? With the right nutrients—calcium, vitamins D and K, healthy fats—you can send in reinforcements to increase bone density, which will make bones stronger as you get older (and heal better if they’re broken).

Keeping the spark alive

The brain is still largely a mystery, but we do know a bit about how our memory declines as we age. To recall information, neurons need to communicate. One sends a message to another, the receiver gets the message, and that connection builds bridges of information that you can use and recall.

If you don’t constantly send and receive messages, your neural connections wither away. External elements affect them as well. For example, the wrong kind of food—think refined and processed—works as extreme weather coming to rust the bridge girders; as a result, inflammation tears the bridges down and it’s harder for information to travel from neuron to neuron.

The right kinds of foods work as bridge builders, cleaners (helping to remove rusty inflammation), and protectors. When you eat them can make a difference, too: In epidemiologic studies, early eating is associated with less cognitive decline, and in animal studies, time-restricted feeding has been shown to prevent it.

Preventing type 2 diabetes

One of the main effects of excess weight and inches around your waist is development of type 2 diabetes, the condition that comes with elevated levels of blood glucose from increased insulin resistance. About 9 percent of Americans have the disease, with at

least another third at risk of developing it. This condition—a leading cause of death in the United States—has plenty of problems associated with it, including eye, nerve, and kidney damage. But it is also scary because of the increased risk of heart and brain-functioning problems.

The way to prevent diabetes comes down to eating healthier and moving your body. Shrinking your waist size and losing weight help decrease insulin. Eating better-quality foods means you’ll be reducing the excess sugar and saturated fat that your body needs to process. That includes avoiding red meats, processed meats, and all processed foods—especially those loaded with sugar.

Activity also helps you lose weight, making your muscles work harder, improving their ability to use insulin and absorb glucose. Managing stress can help, too; you’ll be less likely to seek comfort in excess or poor-quality calories.

Healthy lungs

Although you may not think about your lungs too much (except maybe after climbing eight flights of stairs), you do know the importance of them. Your lungs also serve an important immune function, protecting your body from the outside world—specifically, with little brushes in your tubes called cilia, which clean up the pollutants you breathe in. But they can also be damaged—by smoke, for instance—making them less effective at protecting your lungs for the long term.

Without question, following the lifestyle of saying no to smoking and yes to exercising is paramount to healthy lung function and prevention of lung disease. Foods can help bolster their function. For starters, cut fried foods and maintain a healthy weight. Extra fat in your belly restricts deep breaths and can put undue pressure on your lungs, forcing them to work harder with every breath.

Another tip: Spice up your food, which can help reduce inflammation and assist lung function. Wash it all down with lots of water, which helps keep blood flowing to and from the lungs and allows the mucus collected there to move freely.

Reducing inflammation

For many people, inflammation feels like quantum physics: It sounds serious but what does it actually mean? Yet inflammation in its most chronic form ranks as one of the most important health concepts you should know about. That’s because—unlike the discomfort that comes with a sore throat or a pounding headache—inflammation can be chronic, persistent, and can put your body under attack day after day.

In the beginning, inflammation serves as a positive process in your body; it signals that you’re fighting off something that shouldn’t be there. This is the case when you have a cold or an allergy or a stubbed toe (or even a reaction to an inhaled toxin like those found in many cleaning products). The body knows to identify an injury or insult, then sounds the anatomical alarm to send immune cells into the area to repair it. In the repair process, immune cells tangle with invader cells. The result of this fight—the debris, shrapnel, chaos—is inflammation.

Apply that same thinking to the chronic pounding your cells take when they’re constantly under attack. Such is the case when you have too much blood sugar circulating, or consume too much saturated fat or animal protein. Your body sends signals that it needs help, so it calls for reinforcements. Now it is in constant fight mode and constant inflammation mode.

The result: more inflammation, which puts your body at risk of continuing a vicious cycle that contributes to even more of it. And in the long term, it puts you at higher risk of developing heart disease, stroke, cancer, arthritis, memory issues, pain, hormonal issues, organ damage, and more.

The things you can do to quiet inflammation contain a whole lot of “don’ts.” That’s why not smoking, not eating processed foods or meats are high on the list.

You can also do a lot to help quiet inflammation by eating foods that will help shush the immune response and by eating at the right time. When you move, your body can slow down inflammation. When you’re at rest, sparks will more likely start flying. That’s why it’s especially bad to eat inflammatory foods—those that are processed or have added sugars—at night. Fruits and vegetables, as well as the healthy fats found in fish and nuts, are considered some of the strongest nutritional firepower in the fight against inflammation.

Why morning light is so crucial to your health

POEM: Late lies the wintry sun a-bed, a frosty, fiery sleepy-head; Blinks but an hour or two, and then; A blood-red orange, sets again. STEVE JONES; Senior Research Fellow, Human Genetics, University College London: Sunlight is powerful stuff, perhaps more powerful than most people realise. AARTI JAGANNATH; Associate Professor of Clinical Neuroscience, University of Oxford: Every aspect of how we function is controlled by light. In winter we are seeing a lot less sunlight. STEVE JONES: The perils of living without sunlight are really quite real. CAPTION: THE PERILS OF LIVING WITHOUT ENOUGH LIGHT STEVE JONES: In some ways, modern life has driven us back to the Stone Age, when we lived in caves. In the 60s there were several experiments by French people who went into caves and stayed there. They all began to sleep either for extraordinarily long periods of time or extraordinarily short periods of time, and they couldn't tell the difference. They all said they had severe mood disturbances and depression, so much so that some of them had to leave long before they really had planned to. In winter, we often feel somewhat out of sorts at this time of the year. A lack of sunlight means that your immune system doesn't work as well, your defence mechanisms don't work as well. AARTI JAGANNATH: An effect on mood, increased depression, more metabolic disorders, and all of these things are offshoots of a disrupted circadian clock. CAPTION: THE CIRCADIAN RHYTHM IS AN INTERNAL TIMER SET TO A 24 HOUR RHYTHM AND IS PRESENT IN ALL LIFE AARTI JAGANNATH: It times all of our physiology and all of our behaviour. CAPTION: THE CIRCADIAN RHYTHM IS SET EVERY DAY BY THE RISING OF THE SUN... AARTI JAGANNATH: All of the active sorts of processes are compartmentalised to the day, and all of the restorative processes are kept to the night. CAPTION: DAWN IS THE MOST IMPORTANT LIGHT FOR TIMING OUR CIRCADIAN RHYTHM... AARTI JAGANNATH: The wavelengths that have the most powerful impact are the bluish-coloured ones. Within our eyes there are these cells that have a pigment that's sensitive to this blue light, that then signals to the body clock to tell it what time of day it is. CAPTION: THESE GANGLION CELLS DETECT LIGHT LEVELS BUT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH VISION. THEY ARE JUST AS IMPORTANT FOR SETTING CIRCADIAN RHYTHMS IF YOU'RE BLIND. POEM: Before the stars have left the skies, At morning in the dark I rise; and shivering in my nakedness, by the cold candle, bathe and dress. STEVE JONES: Many people don't realise what an artificial life we live. That's because artificial life depends on artificial light. AARTI JAGANNATH: So by seeking out artificial light, what that is doing is giving your body a time cue that is incorrect. Then you might end up feeling far more alert at night, or a lot more depressed during the day. CAPTION: WORKING NIGHT SHIFTS CAN HAVE A PROFOUND EFFECT ON THE WAY THE BODY REGULATES ITSELF. IN BRITAIN MORE THAN 3 MILLION PEOPLE WORK NIGHT SHIFTS AARTI JAGANNATH: Your systems within your body tend to desynchronise and so you tend to have a higher incidence of diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease. CAPTION: THE CONFUSING LIGHT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HOME, WORK AND THE COMMUTE, MEAN THAT 97% OF SHIFT WORKERS NEVER ADJUST THEIR SLEEP CYCLES. STEVE JONES: The World Health Organization sees shift work as a threat to health, and it is. Many British people spend less than half an hour a day in the open air. CAPTION: UN RULES STATE THAT EVERY PRISONER MUST SPEND AT LEAST ONE HOUR A DAY OUTSIDE. STEVE JONES: So it's no good staying inside and looking at the Sun and saying this is doing me good, because it isn't. AARTI JAGANNATH: So it's probably, on a day like today, about four or five times less light simply being on this side of the glass. A good dose of bright sunshine at any time during the day has a huge impact on elevating mood and general feelings of wellbeing. There was a study at the Broadmoor institute where they looked at the effects of the equivalent of 20 minutes of bright sunshine in the morning on mood. What they found was the bright light had a much greater effect on elevating mood than even some anti-depressants. POET: When to go out, my nurse doth wrap me in my comforter and cap; The cold wind burns my face, and blows its frosty pepper. AARTI JAGANNATH: So our skin's not just a barrier, it's a living organ. When our skin sees sunlight, that is when it starts making vitamin D, which is an essential component of many different signalling pathways in our body. STEVE JONES: You can get vitamin D in several ways. You can do what I do, and take a vitamin D pill. A diet of wild salmon and mushrooms and you won’t get rickets. But overwhelmingly the best way is through the sun. CAPTION: A VITAMIN D DEFICIENCY CAN MAKE YOU MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO DISEASES SUCH AS RICKETS AND TUBERCULOSIS. RICKETS, A CONDITION CAUSING SOFT, WEAK BONES, IS ON THE RISE. STEVE JONES: It's coming back for genuinely depressing reasons. The amount of sunlight we're getting has gone down dramatically in the last 20 years. It's gone down particularly fast in the last two or three years. AARTI JAGANNATH: We're not getting outside, and this is going to have an impact on how well the body clock is aligned. It makes us even more like hermits in a cave relying on artificial light. Have meals at the right time, go to bed at the right time, and get out, even if it's freezing, for that daily 20-minute walk and some light exposure. Simply being outside and exposing yourself to light, so that you strengthen your circadian clock is going to have a hugely beneficial impact on health and wellbeing.

459,459,https://www.eco-business.com/news/after-sun-dimming-setback-geoengineers-seek-a-diplomatic-fix/,"After sun-dimming setback, geoengineers seek a diplomatic fix","In 1965, United States President Lyndon Johnson’s science advisors had pushed for more research into reflecting sunlight to keep the Earth cool, amid projections of an alarming build-up of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere as a result of burning fossil fuels.

Almost six decades later, this “solar geoengineering” research has made scant headway. It attracts less than 1 per cent of climate science budgets, amid fears that tampering with the global thermostat could produce unexpected consequences, and distract from an overriding need for deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions.

But governments are facing ever starker choices as global warming creeps towards 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) — a threshold set in the 2015 Paris Agreement, agreed by about 200 countries, to avert ever more damaging floods, droughts, wildfires and melting ice.

Such impacts are already surging with temperatures now just 1.1 degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels.

Last year, opposition from indigenous peoples forced the cancellation of an early, high-profile outdoor test of solar geoengineering technology by Harvard University.

The planned balloon flight over Sweden was designed as a first step towards releasing tiny reflective particles 20 kilometres high in the atmosphere, to see if they could form a planetary haze mimicking a volcanic eruption.

Major eruptions — like that of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines in 1991 — can cut global temperatures for more than a year, as an ashen mask circulates in the stratosphere.

This year, after the setback, backers of research into the risks and benefits of solar geoengineering are turning to diplomacy to advance their work.

“There is no question that in the public battle, if it is Harvard against the indigenous peoples, we cannot proceed. That is just a reality,” said David Keith, a professor of applied physics at the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, who was involved in the balloon project, known as SCoPEx.

Harvard had been considering alternative launch sites but Keith said that the project could also “be killed”. “We really do not know,” he said.

Indigenous opposition

Åsa Larsson-Blind, vice president of the Saami Council of reindeer herders, which led opposition to the test, sent an open letter to Harvard University in June urging an end to SCoPEx.

The group said the project violated indigenous peoples’ principles of living in harmony with nature. So far, “we haven’t heard back”, she said.

Janos Pasztor, executive director of the Carnegie Climate Governance Initiative, said the focus of solar geoengineering research efforts was shifting to winning broader backing for them.

He said he doubted there would be any outdoor experiments in the upper atmosphere this year.

“There is diplomatic work behind the scenes — you do not see a lot of this on Twitter,” he said.

One aim of the push is to have solar geoengineering discussed for the first time by the United Nations (UN) General Assembly, the top UN policy-making body, in a session starting in September 2023.

Pasztor said that the risks of geoengineering - such as a potential skewing of global weather patterns and monsoon rains - had to be judged against fast-worsening climate change impacts.

“Are the risks of a 2 degree Celsius (warmer) world worse than the risks of geoengineering?”, he asked.

That is a question expected to rise on the global diplomatic agenda.

Facing up to overshoot

In coming weeks, the Paris Peace Forum, a non-governmental group, plans to appoint a commission of former government leaders to consider options if global temperatures overshoot the Paris Agreement’s goals.

The “Global Commission on Governing Risks from Climate Overshoot”, to be chaired by Pascal Lamy, a former head of the World Trade Organization, will have 12 to 15 members and report back late next year.

Adrien Abecassis, who coordinates the work at the Paris Peace Forum, said the commission would consider both solar geoengineering and ways to extract carbon from the air, along with options such as more climate finance to help developing nations adapt to climate change.

Switzerland also is considering submitting a resolution to the UN Environment Assembly, which is likely to meet in April, to seek UN-level consideration of climate altering technologies and measures (CATM).

“Switzerland is of the view that an authoritative report by the UN system is key to enable an informed debate on CATM and their governance,” said Felix Wertli, head of the global affairs section of the Swiss Federal Office for the Environment, in an email.

Switzerland, backed by 10 other nations, withdrew a similar resolution at the UN Environment Assembly in 2019 after it failed to win sufficient support.

Moratorium push

Some prominent scientists opposed to geoengineering say there is no need to advance consideration of such technologies as a way to address runaway climate change.

“It is dangerous to normalise solar geoengineering research,” Frank Biermann of Utrecht University wrote in the journal Nature last year, on behalf of 17 scientists, after the journal argued for more research.

Instead, “a global moratorium is needed”, he said.

Biermann and more than 60 climate scientists and governance experts on Monday launched an appeal for an “international non-use agreement on solar geoengineering”, aimed at halting development and deployment of the technology.

Decarbonising economies needs to be the global priority, they argued, terming solar geoengineering neither ethical nor politically governable.

Lili Fuhr, head of international environmental policy at Germany’s Heinrich Böll Foundation, which opposes geoengineering research, said “any next stage of research would basically take us down a slippery slope towards deployment. We know enough about its dangers that we can never use it.”

The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is expected to provide a scientific update on geoengineering research as part of a report due in early April about ways to combat climate change too.

Developing world views

Research on geoengineering options by scientists in developing nations is also growing.

Projects under a fund known as Decimals include how “solar radiation management” (SRM) — another term for solar geoengineering — could affect malaria rates in Bangladesh and dust storms in the Middle East.

A team led by Inés Camilloni of the University of Buenos Aires is looking at how SRM might affect rainfall in the basin of the La Plata river in South America, home to 160 million people.

“A key area of concern is the insufficient knowledge about the potential impacts at regional scale — and in this sense much more research is needed,” she said.

Andy Parker, who heads the Degrees Initiative and who helped create the Decimals project, said research into SRM in developing countries “is feasible, it is desirable.”

The Degrees Initiative, a UK non-profit group, was launched in 2010 as a partnership between the UK Royal Society, the Italy-based World Academy of Sciences, and the US Environmental Defense Fund.

It says it wants to help developing nations evaluate the “controversial technology” of SRM.

Back in the 1960s, US President Johnson’s science advisors had little inkling that global warming would become so severe in the 21st century, said Parker.

He predicted that the looming 1.5C threshold would force people to face up to what he called “the big question”: what are our options if emissions cuts prove insufficient?

While case counts appear to be declining, some health experts warn it’s not over yet.

Dr. Jack O’Horo, an infectious disease expert at Mayo Clinic Health System in Rochester, said during a recent call with reporters that it’s unclear when COVID-19 will transition from a worldwide pandemic to an endemic level, where a disease has an expected presence year-round or at certain times of the year.

He said many people are already familiar with influenza’s endemic activity, or what most call the flu season.

""As (influenza) activity increases during the winter, there's a certain expected level of increase that we see that we accept as just part of normal variation,"" O’Horo said.

He said part of why it’s unclear when the pandemic will end is because epidemiologists and other experts are still trying to define what the threshold is for the disease to reach an endemic level.

""Determining what that background level is will require some real research and looking at these numbers,"" O’Horo said. ""The fortunate thing right now is we're continuing to see numbers fall as we approach this new normal.""

According to the Wisconsin Department of Health Services, there was a seven-day average of 467 new cases reported daily as of Tuesday. That’s down significantly from the state’s all-time high on Jan. 19, when there was an average of 18,798 daily cases.

With high levels of natural immunity from recent cases and higher vaccination rates, O’Horo is optimistic that new cases will continue to decline this summer.

He said responding to local disease activity rather than state or national numbers will be one of the most important transitions in reaching an endemic stage. He points out the latest guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention makes recommendations for masks and social distancing based on county-level disease activity.

Sign up for daily news! Stay informed with WPR's email newsletter.

""It is different than the nationwide or even worldwide perspective we've had at different points in the past,"" O’Horo said. ""In this endemic phase, we're really looking at that local transmission level, that local background activity and spikes above that, which means keeping abreast of what is the local conditions.""

He said public health authorities will continue to play an important role in monitoring local conditions and people should still pay attention to recommended health precautions like wearing a mask.

""Just because it's safe to take off the mask three counties over in one setting doesn't mean it's safe to do the same in this county in a more vulnerable setting,"" he said.

Vaccinations will continue to play an important role in preventing new outbreaks of COVID-19. But O’Horo said it’s not clear how often people will need to get a jab. He said there’s a possibility that health experts could recommend an annual vaccine like the flu shot, or even develop a combined flu and COVID-19 vaccine.

""That's what keeps the disease in check, what keeps it manageable enough that we don't overwhelm our hospitals and clinics like we have in the past few years of this pandemic, and helps keep us in a more normal phase of life,"" he said.

O’Horo warns that achieving an endemic level of virus spread does not eliminate the possibility that another COVID-19 epidemic — where cases surge above normal in a specific region — or even pandemic, could happen.

""This is unfortunately not a one-way door,"" he said. ""That's something that we see with influenza, where every few years there's a strain that's worse than others and becomes an epidemic or pandemic strain.""

But after living through the last two years, O’Horo is hopeful that people’s awareness about the importance of public health measures and researchers' abilities to quickly develop new vaccines will prevent the region and the world from having to experience another pandemic.","It’s been around two years since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in Wisconsin.

On Tuesday, the Virginia Department of Wildlife Resources released its Chronic Wasting Disease Surveillance results for the 2021-2022 hunting season.

In Virginia, a total of 134 deer from eleven counties have tested positive for the disease since 2009.

This incurable disease, found in deer, elk, and moose in North America, is a slow and progressive neurologic disease that ultimately results in death of the animal.The disease-causing agent is spread through the urine, feces, and saliva of infected animals.

In CWD Disease Management Area 3, which comprises Floyd, Montgomery and Pulaski Counties, of the 1,259 deer tested, two tested positive for the disease.

One in Montgomery County, and the other, in Floyd County.

A third deer, sampled by a cooperator located in DMA3, was determined to be infected with CWD; however, the location of harvest for this animal was not able to be confirmed.

Because of the new CWD detection in Floyd County, the Department of Wildlife Resources is expanding that DMA to include Carroll County.

Officials said the diseased deer found in Floyd County was about 5 miles from the 2020 Montgomery County detection, and less than 10 miles from Carroll County.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Last week, harsh financial sanctions and trade restrictions were put in place to punish Russia and cripple its economy. Among them, the banning of all Russian imports of oil, gas, and coal, as well as goods like vodka and caviar. Joining us now is the managing director of the IMF, Kristalina Georgieva. Welcome to FACE THE NATION.

MANAGING DIRECTOR OF THE IMF KRISTALINA GEORGIEVA: Thank you very much for having me.

MARGARET BRENNAN: I wonder how you can calculate the total impact of all of these restrictions that have been put on Russia. I mean, it- will Russia default on its debts and what impact will that have to the global economy?

KRISTALINA GEORGIEVA: Let's remember that the reason they're unprecedented sanctions is because the unthinkable happened, a devastating war in Ukraine. And the impact of the sanctions is quite severe for the Russian economy. We expect a deep recession in Russia, and this abrupt contraction is affecting already how the Russian population is taking the heat on them. The ruble depreciated significantly. What does it mean? Real incomes have shrunk. Purchasing power of the Russian population has significantly diminished. In terms of servicing debt obligations, I can say that no longer we think of Russian default as improbable event. Russia has the money to service its debt, but cannot access it. What I'm more concerned is that there are consequences that go beyond Ukraine and Russia.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. I mean, you have said that the crisis in Ukraine could cause famine in Africa, for example, you look at the wheat imports and the price spikes there. Which countries around the world are you most concerned about? Is this going to destabilize other governments?

KRISTALINA GEORGIEVA: What we are mostly concerned about are the immediate neighbors of Russia and Ukraine, the Central Asian republics, the Caucasus, Moldova, because they have trade relations with both Russia and Ukraine more than the rest of the world, and because of this outflow of people refugee wave in Europe, that is of the order of magnitude of what happened in the Second World War. So there the impact is most significant. Beyond the immediate neighbors, there are two groups of countries we are very worried. The first group are countries that have yet to recover from the COVID-induced economic crisis. For them, this shock is particularly painful. And the second group of countries are those that are more dependent on energy imports from Russia, because there the impact on consumption, but also on inflation is going to be more prominent.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Are we looking, because of the debt levels you talk about, the vulnerability, are we looking at the potential of this becoming a financial crisis for the rest of the world?

KRISTALINA GEORGIEVA: For now, no. When you look at the total exposure of banks to Russia, it is about a hundred and twenty billion dollars. Not negligent, but definitely not systemically relevant. And to what we are also seeing is that while inevitably we are going to downgrade our growth projections for 2022, it is still going to be a positive growth rate. For countries that have been fast to recover from the COVID crisis, like the United States, growth is robust. It is those that were falling behind where the impact is more severe. And let me say this, yes, war in Ukraine means hunger in Africa, but war in Ukraine also has social implications for many, many countries through the three channels that are already demonstrably impactful. One, commodity prices, energy, grains, fertilizers, metals to the impact that has on inflation and in countries where inflation has already been high, this is dramatic--

MARGARET BRENNAN: --like the United States,

KRISTALINA GEORGIEVA: Like United States, like many emerging market countries, think of Brazil, Mexico and three, what do we do when we have to fight inflation? We tighten financial conditions.

MARGARET BRENNAN: I have a question for you. You've been working on emergency funding for Ukraine. If that government falls, can Russia seize that money? If Russia installs a puppet government in Ukraine, can they get access to that money?

KRISTALINA GEORGIEVA: We are thinking of our internal interactions with Ukraine as being very productive. We have provided 1.4 billion dollars in emergency financing into the Ukrainian special account with the IMF. In other words, it is being drone by the government of Ukraine and nobody else can touch it. And we see that the Ukrainian authorities have been remarkable. Margaret, we had negotiations on this 1.4 billion and my staff tells me they can hear the air raid sirens and yet works go on. I have family in Ukraine. They tell me they can still pull money from back home. That's even in the city of Kharkiv that is the second-largest, heavily bombarded city. So bravo to the Ukrainian authorities for what they do.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Director, thank you for your time this morning.

KRISTALINA GEORGIEVA: Thank you.

466,466,https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2022/03/pandemic-global-south-disease-health-crisis/624179/,The Pandemic Is Following a Very Predictable and Depressing Pattern,"Americans, by and large, are putting the pandemic behind them. Now that Omicron is in the rearview mirror and cases are plummeting, even many of those who have stayed cautious for two full years are spouting narratives about “going back to normal” and “living with COVID-19.” This mentality has also translated into policy: The last pandemic restrictions are fading nationwide, and in his State of the Union address on Tuesday night, President Joe Biden declared that “most Americans can remove their masks, return to work, stay in the classroom, and move forward safely.” Other rich, highly vaccinated countries are following much the same path. In the U.K., for example, those with COVID-19 no longer have to self-isolate. It helps that these countries have more vaccine doses than they know what to do with, and a stockpile of tools to test and treat their residents if and when they get sick.

But in the global South, COVID-19 is much harder to ignore. More than a year after the start of the mass-vaccination campaign, nearly 3 billion people are still waiting for their first shot. While an average of 80 percent of people in high-income countries have gotten at least one dose, that figure stands at just 13 percent in low-income countries. In the poorest countries, virtually no booster shots have been administered. Such low vaccination rates are taking their toll. Although the official death count in India is about 500,000, for example, the reality might be closer to 5 million excess deaths—and most of those deaths happened after vaccines were introduced in the global North.

The rush in the rich countries to declare the pandemic “over” while it continues to ravage the global South is completely predictable—in fact, the same trend has played out again and again. Infectious diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis, and AIDS that are now seen as “Third World diseases” were once serious threats in rich countries, but when incidence of these diseases began to decline there, the global North moved on and reduced investments in new tools and programs. Now, with COVID-19, the developing world has once again been left to fend for itself against an extremely transmissible virus without the necessary vaccine doses, tests, and treatment tools. Some pandemics never truly end—they just become invisible to people in the global North.

You may know malaria as an infectious disease that affects poor “tropical” countries. But for several thousands of years, malaria was a global menace. During the 20th century alone, the disease is estimated to have accounted for up to 5 percent of all human deaths. It was eradicated from the global North by the 1970s, but the rest of the world was left behind. In 2020, there were an estimated 240 million malaria cases, and nearly all of the 627,000 deaths occurred in sub-Saharan Africa. For a disease that affected even our neolithic ancestors, the world had to wait until 2021 for the first-ever malaria vaccine. Though the World Health Organization recently endorsed this partially effective malaria vaccine, expanded manufacturing and scale-up plans remain undetermined.

The same phenomenon has unfolded with tuberculosis, a disease so old that DNA of TB bacteria have been identified in Egyptian mummies. “Consumption,” as TB was once called, was highly prevalent in Europe and North America. From the 1600s to the 1800s, TB caused 25 percent of all deaths in Europe. By the 1980s, TB case numbers had decreased significantly in the West, largely thanks to drug treatments and reductions in poverty. But again, TB remains a problem in developing countries (and among marginalized populations within the global North). In 2020, TB killed 1.5 million people, more than 80 percent of whom lived in low- and middle-income countries. Investments and innovations to make the disease less devastating have been scarce: For example, the TB vaccine we use today is more than 100 years old, and it has limited efficacy in adults.

Unlike malaria and tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS was identified only 40 years ago, and still we’ve seen the same trend. After the infection emerged in the early 1980s, it went from a condition thought to affect only gay men in the global North to a global pandemic that, yes, mostly affects the global South today. In 2020, nearly 38 million people globally were living with HIV, and 680,000 people died from AIDS-related illnesses, with two-thirds of both cases and deaths in Africa. When effective antiretroviral drugs first became available in the early 1990s, they were expensive and mainly accessible to people in high-income countries. For these lifesaving tools to reach the global South took incredible activism and years of effort, and millions of people (mostly Africans) died as a result of this inaction. Even today, we do not have a vaccine against AIDS.

Despite the continued toll of these “big three” infectious diseases, they are rarely spoken of as pandemics. “By epidemic we actually mean a pandemic that no longer kills people in rich countries,” wrote Peter Sands, the CEO of the Global Fund, an international group that combats these diseases. “By endemic we actually mean a disease the world could get rid of but hasn’t. HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria are pandemics that have been beaten in rich countries. Allowing them to persist elsewhere is a policy choice and a budgetary decision.”

With the coronavirus, the global South is being left behind once again. Rich countries are already rapidly losing interest, and if the virus continues to fizzle out in these areas, they might show less urgency in sharing vaccines and other resources, stop investing in new products to fight the virus, and place the burden of disease control primarily on resource-strapped low-income countries. Rich countries such as the United States have donated hundreds of millions of doses to the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access Facility (COVAX), but citing supply issues, the initiative didn’t even get halfway to its goal of delivering 2 billion doses last year.

Read: Democracies keep vaccines for themselves

Even if rich nations continue to offer charity and donations, they seem less likely to support efforts that would let lower-income countries procure and manufacture their own tools to battle this virus. HIV medication became affordable to the global South only when countries such as India started manufacturing their own generic pills. The same must happen for COVID-19 vaccines to be more accessible. After Omicron, some have suggested that it’s too late to meet the WHO’s target of vaccinating 70 percent of the world by mid-2022. When we should be redoubling efforts to increase vaccination, the narrative that it’s too late to vaccinate the world could have a chilling effect on the global COVID-19 vaccination campaign.

The developed world is repeating its mistakes again, and this will have devastating consequences for billions of people. Diseases becoming “endemic” should not be code for inaction or lack of consideration for those with few resources and many vulnerabilities—in both the global North and the global South. Even when they’re invisible to some, high death and infection rates cannot be seen as acceptable or normal.

Read: Endemicity is meaningless

For now, the biggest problem with the global North proclaiming that the coronavirus pandemic is “over” is that it manifests the opposite outcome. Eventually, even rich countries will bear the brunt of tuning out COVID-19. Allowing infectious diseases to circulate in any part of the world within large populations of unvaccinated people will almost surely result in the emergence of new variants that will affect all nations.

Privileged people should not get to decide on their own that a global pandemic is over. The way out is the same as it’s always been: making sure we get everyone to the finish line, not just a select few. Humanity did this with smallpox and could soon achieve this with polio and guinea-worm infections.

The Biden administration’s $6.4 billion request to Congress to respond to the Ukraine crisis includes $3.5 billion for the Pentagon, to pay for operating costs associated with the surge to the current 100,000 U.S. troops in Europe or its waters and also to backfill weapons the U.S. military is sending from its stockpiles to Ukraine.

Assistant Defense Secretary for Strategy, Plans and Capabilities Mara Karlin told the House Armed Services Committee that the Pentagon would be re-examining the Global Posture Review, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin’s most recent troop allocation plan.

“We recognize this dynamic situation now requires us to give it another fine-tooth look, to see what’s necessary to ensure that we’ve got deterrence of Russia and that we can absolutely 150% say that NATO is safe and secure,” Karlin said.

“So we’re looking at what sort of troop presence – whether it’s rotational or permanent – is necessary given this current security environment, both in the near term and frankly, and in the long term.”

The comment was in response to HASC’s top Republican, Rep. Mike Rogers, who said that prior to Russia’s invasion there was talk of permanently-stationed U.S. troops in Romania, and the Baltic countries. “Does the administration support this result that after this invasion, that we make that troop presence permanent in those Eastern European front countries,” Rogers asked.

Earlier this month, Rogers and Rep. Mike Turner, who is the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, sent a letter to Romanian President Klaus Iohannis encouraging the U.S. and Romanian governments to explore ways to create a permanent joint military base in Romania.

Eastern European NATO members have long sought heftier troop commitments from major alliance members to signal deterrence to Russia. There are already battlegroups in the three Baltic states, provided by European and Canadian forces, and Poland hosts a similar contingent under U.S. leadership. France announced last week it would send a new formation to Romania, comprised of 500 personnel and armored vehicles.

Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas on Tuesday urged NATO to do more for the Baltics. Speaking alongside British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg at Tapa military base in Estonia, she said the three small countries need better defense capabilities on land and in the air. The alliance should “move from air policing to air defense,” she said.

The Pentagon has in recent days mobilized some 14,000 of troops, along with F-35 strike fighters and Apache helicopters to Poland, Hungary and the Baltics. The U.S. troop presence had surged from 80,000, an uptick that U.S. President Joe Biden has stressed is meant to reinforce allies and not for getting involved in Russia’s war on Ukraine.

U.S. materiel pledged to Ukraine since September has included Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, Javelin anti-tank missiles, grenade launchers, and more than 2,000 tons of ammunition including mortar and artillery rounds, small arms and machine guns, Karlin said.

In the last six months, Biden has authorized three tranches of aid under his drawdown authority, which included equipment from U.S. stockpiles, including a package worth $350 million last week. The U.S. has committed $1 billion in security assistance to Ukraine over the last year.

Rogers criticized the administration for moving too cautiously on the aid as Russian troops amassed on Ukraine’s borders. He urged that NATO allies receive the surface-to-surface Army Tactical Missile System and High Mobility Artillery Rocket System.

“It is now more important than ever to reinforce our NATO allies, especially those on the Eastern front,” Rogers said. Romania, Poland and the Baltic states need advanced integrated air defense assets, missile systems like HIMARS and ATACMS – and enhanced permanent U.S. troop presence – and they need it yesterday.”

Pressure on the administration came from both sides of the aisle. Emphasizing the unique level of bipartisan support for Ukraine and urgency of its fight, Michigan Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin pressed for the administration to be more forthcoming about its needs.

“I would just say you have an absolutely unique moment where the U.S. Congress has bipartisan agreement on giving you what you need, and we’re not getting an ask,” said Slotkin, who is a former Pentagon official. “Ask us for things and we will help you.”

Congress’s Democratic leaders have signaled that an omnibus funding bill for fiscal 2023, already five months overdue and needed to fund the U.S. federal government by March 11, will have to either take precedence or include the administration’s request for Ukraine aid.

Rep. Doug Lamborn, R-Colo., was among some of the Republicans who have pushed back in favor of immediate action, urging the White House to “get our leadership off the dime.”

“They’re doing nothing here in the House,” Lamborn said. “We could be sending this money to Ukraine, and people are literally dying and will die in the next week, needlessly.”

HASC Chairman Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., argued that while the House was taking time to get the legislation right, Biden was taking executive action to send Ukraine weapons and humanitarian aid.

“There is a ton of money that is flowing out of the United States of America right now to help the people of Ukraine,” Smith said, adding: “If nothing was happening, then I would be right there with you, saying we got to pass this yesterday.”

Alexi Rosenfeld/Getty Images COVID-19 is expected to become a seasonal illness like most respiratory viruses that strike in the winter months, according to the CDC’s Dr. Rochelle Walensky.

Scientists are monitoring how prior infection and vaccination might impact future coronavirus infection and hospitalization rates.

While stricter measures are less likely to return, epidemiologists say face masks and physical distancing may be recommended when infections spike in the future. Earlier this week, the Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said she expects COVID-19 to become a seasonal illness that ebbs and flows with the weather. After all, the other coronaviruses that cause the common cold are known to strike during the winter months and settle down in the warmer months. The same is true with other respiratory infections, like influenza, strep throat, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). These viruses spread year-round but typically spike in the winter. Epidemiologists say stricter measures — like lockdowns and capacity limitations at certain venues — are unlikely to return. But masking and physical distancing may continue to be recommended during future surges.

Will COVID-19 become seasonal? Dr. Shruti Gohil, the associate medical director of epidemiology and infection prevention at UCI Health, said there does appear to be some degree of seasonality to COVID-19 already. As we’ve observed over the past two years, COVID-19 cases have increased during the winter months when transmission of cold and flu viruses usually increases. Some studies have shown that hot and humid environments hinder the coronavirus’s viability, while colder climates with lower humidity levels may help the virus spread. “Research is still evolving, but there is some evidence that the virus dies when exposed to certain levels of UV light, making it harder to spread during the sunny summer months as opposed to winter,” said Dr. Bernadette Boden-Albala, MPH, DrPH, director and founding dean of the Program in Public Health at the University of California, Irvine. Evidence also suggests areas with air pollution have been linked to higher rates of COVID-19 cases along with increased severity in disease and death. It’s also important to consider how our behaviors influence the spread of respiratory viruses in the different seasons. “We spend more time indoors — where the virus spreads more easily — in the colder months, with less options for outdoor recreational activities,” Boden-Albala told Healthline. When we spend more time indoors, we are in closer contact with others and are therefore more likely to transmit respiratory viruses. All that said, data has shown that COVID-19 spreads year-round to varying degrees. “It is also clear that COVID should not be considered restricted to the winter months and that it can appear any time of the year,” Gohil said.

What will happen when COVID-19 cases increase? According to Gohil, transitioning to an endemic phase of COVID-19 — in which the disease reaches some degree of stability and predictability — does not mean we won’t see new outbreaks, variants, and sporadic increases in COVID-19-related hospitalizations. It’s unclear how many cases and hospitalizations we will see each year once COVID-19 becomes endemic. “Right now, it’s still hard to tell because we haven’t reached the stability in cases that we need to accurate determine a baseline level,” Boden-Albala said. Epidemiologists are also tracking how prior infection and vaccination affect the rates of infection, hospitalization, and death across the population. We can expect public health experts to use disease modeling tools to make new projections about how the virus will spread in the future, according to Boden-Albala. If new variants emerge that test the immunity the population has conferred through prior infection and vaccination, we may see some restrictions — like face masks and physical distancing — return. Stricter lockdowns, including school and business closures, are not expected to return. If and how the coronavirus will mutate and evolve is unclear. For the time being, epidemiologists recommend we stay on top of vaccination recommendations and monitor local and nationwide guidelines to mitigate our chances of experiencing future surges and more restrictions. “We anticipate new seasons of increased cases and, yes, some restrictions may need to be put back into place, at least in modified form, to meet the needs of any given uptick,” Gohil said.","Alexi Rosenfeld/Getty Images COVID-19 is expected to become a seasonal illness like most respiratory viruses that strike in the winter months, according to the CDC’s Dr. Rochelle Walensky.

Last McDonald’s promotion saw free Big Mac lunchboxes given away

This McDonald’s offer comes after a rather quirky promotion. Last month, the fast food chain gave out free lunchboxes resembling a Big Mac to anyone who can “rap” the ingredients of the burger to a staff member.

The exterior of the lunchbox was printed to look like the lettuce, beef patty, cheese, and burger buns of the famous Big Mac. Inside, it also contained a detachable partition that allowed users to separate their food.

Unfortunately, the lunchbox was limited to the first 5,000 customers only.

However, we are looking forward to seeing what other creative promotions McDonald’s Singapore comes up with next.

471,471,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/19/former-ny-post-editor-sues-news-corp-and-col-allan-alleging-harassment,"Former NY Post editor sues News Corp and Col Allan, alleging sexual harassment","Former senior New York Post journalist Michelle Gotthelf has launched legal action accusing the tabloid’s longtime editor-in-chief, Col Allan, of sexually harassing and verbally abusing her, including propositioning her for sex.

In a complaint filed in the US federal court system on Tuesday, Gotthelf accused the Post’s owner, News Corp, Allan and the paper’s current editor-in-chief, Keith Poole, of breaching New York employment law by discriminating against her on the basis of her sex and retaliating against her when she complained.

She also claimed Allan intervened in coverage of Donald Trump, demanding a story about the then president being accused of rape be removed from the paper’s website and calling the complaint “baseless shit”.

Allan is an Australian who was formerly editor-in-chief of the Daily Telegraph in Sydney while Poole is an Englishman who has held senior roles at the Sun and Daily Mail.

Gotthelf said Poole fired her last week, ending her 20-year career at News Corp.

She said she suffered “severe mental anguish and emotional distress, including, but not limited to, humiliation, embarrassment, stress and anxiety,” and is seeking damages from News Corp, Allan and Poole.

In her complaint, filed with the district court for the southern district of New York, she made allegations of misconduct against Allan that date back to 2007, when she alleged she was passed over for a promotion from deputy metro editor to metro editor in 2007 because Allan said he “wanted a strong man in the job”.

Allan “instead promoted a substantially less qualified man” who “had little, if any, experience in non-business news and no experience running a newsroom”, Gotthelf claims.

She said that from 2013 Allan had created a hostile work environment for her despite describing her as a “star”.

“Mr Allan delighted in degrading Ms Gotthelf, and women generally, in front of her mostly male peers,” she alleged in the complaint.

“For example, Mr Allan would refer to women in news stories as ‘skanks’ or ‘stupid women.’ He described a female NY Post editor as a ‘sneaky lesbian.’ He likewise told Ms Gotthelf that Mr Murdoch ‘doesn’t like many women’.”

She alleged Allan also “despised the LGBTQ+ community”.

“For instance, he refused to put New York’s historic legalization of same-sex marriage on the front page, asking, ‘What will these people be marrying next, animals?’”

She claimed when she complained to her boss, he “acknowledged the abuse but shrugged, ‘Not much I can do.’”

The sexual harassment allegedly peaked in 2015 when she alleged Allan propositioned her for sex, saying “We should sleep together”.

Her rejection allegedly resulted in Allan becoming more abusive, refusing to make eye contact with her and scrapping her articles for no apparent reason.

“On one occasion, he ripped up a list of stories that Ms Gotthelf had prepared and screamed at her to ‘get the fuck out’,” according to her complaint.

She said she complained to HR, which she claims resulted in Allan being forced to “retire” from the paper after he was told of the complaint, despite the company’s promise it would be kept confidential.

In early 2019, Allan was rehired as a newsroom consultant.

Gotthelf said she negotiated a new employment contract in which News had promised she would not have to report to Allan, but she said this proved to be a “hollow” promise.

“Not only was Mr Allan giving Ms Gotthelf directions, but he was also becoming more threatening and abusive,” she alleged.

He allegedly ordered her to remove a June 2019 story in which a woman accused Donald Trump of raping her, calling the woman’s claims “baseless shit” and describing her as “the world[’s] unluckiest woman or a liar”.

She said she complained to News Corp chief executive, Robert Thomson, and head of HR, Dana Ritzcovan, and was told that if Allan “tells you to do something, you do it”.

She claimed she was effectively demoted in January when Poole was made editor-in-chief and her direct reporting line to the publisher was removed.

Ahead of the appointment she met with Poole for lunch. Poole allegedly did not discuss her impending contract renewal but instead focused on asking about what “happened between you and Col”, she alleges.

“Ms Gotthelf explained that Mr Allan had sexually propositioned her and that she did not want to go through that again,” she alleges in the complaint.

“On January 12, 2022, only two months later, Mr Poole fired Ms Gotthelf without cause.”

Gotthelf’s departure was announced to staff in an email sent on Tuesday.

“I wanted to let you know that Michelle Gotthelf has departed The Post, effective January 15,” Poole said in the email, which was provided to Guardian Australia by a News Corp spokesperson on Wednesday.

“I want to take this opportunity to thank her for all she has done during her 20-plus-year tenure here, and I hope you will join me in wishing her the best for the future.”

In a separate statement, the News Corp spokesperson said: “Any suggestion of wrongdoing related to the management changes announced today is meritless.”

She said Poole had no additional comment to make and she did not have contact information for Allan. Guardian Australia has been unable to contact Allan for comment.

The defendants have yet to file a defence.","“Mr Allan delighted in degrading Ms Gotthelf, and women generally, in front of her mostly male peers,” she alleged in the complaint.

472,472,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-07042-5,Host microbiome responses to the Snake Fungal Disease pathogen (Ophidiomyces ophidiicola) are driven by changes in microbial richness,"Snake and soil collection

The Common Watersnake (Nerodia sipedon) is a nonvenomous semi-aquatic snake found throughout Eastern and Central North America53. We collected 22 N. sipedon in Tennessee during spring 2019. Any animal from the sham control group that had a positive qPCR reaction (Ct < 39) throughout the experiment (n = 4) was removed from all statistical analyses. Study snakes had a mean snout-vent length (SVL) of 28.4 cm and a mean mass of 11.4 g (Supplementary Material, Table S1). Study snakes were primarily neonates or juveniles with 15 of 18 animals having an SVL less than 25 cm (Supplementary Material, Table S1). We used nitrile gloves while handling snakes to prevent transmission of microbes between animals. We collected snakes free of clinical signs, to control for initial disease state, and further confirmed absence of O. ophidiicola using quantitative PCR (qPCR) of skin swabs54. We collected soil from snake capture locations to create a pseudo-naturalistic environmental reservoir of microbes. We collected a two-liter bag of soil three meters away from the closest riverbank of each snake capture location. As with snake samples, we confirmed the absence of O. ophidiicola in soil samples via qPCR. We stored soil samples at 4 °C in darkness in a bag that allowed for gas exchange but conserved moisture until mesocosm construction.

Mesocosm design and animal care

Throughout the experiment, snakes were maintained individually in 66.24 L plastic storage totes (66 × 34 × 41 cm) with ventilation holes. We used a soil/aspen substrate mixture to provide an environmental reservoir of microbes. Specifically, equal parts, by weight, of each soil sample were mixed for 15 min until homogeneous. We combined this soil mixture with autoclaved aspen shavings in a 2:1 soil to aspen ratio by weight. We evenly layered this substrate into snake enclosures in a ~ 6 cm deep layer. When soiled, substrate was spot cleaned and replaced completely whenever snakes spilled large amounts of water. Snake enclosures had a hide box, autoclaved climbing branch, and water dish. Enclosures were located in a 23 °C room with a 12-h light/dark cycle. Depending on animal size, snakes were offered as many Guppies (Poecilia reticulata; small snakes; < 35 cm SVL) or Platies (Xiphophorus maculatus; large snakes; > 35 cm SVL) as they would consume weekly.

Live animal trials

The experiment began on 31 May 2019 and concluded on 21 August 2019. Eleven snakes were randomly assigned to both the inoculation treatment and sham control groups. The snakes in the treatment group were inoculated with O. ophidiicola using the following procedure: A culture of O. ophidiicola was grown on Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) for 15 days and sectioned into 0.5 cm2 blocks then placed, mycelium side up, onto a waterproof bandage. Similar to Lorch et al. (2015), #150 sandpaper was used to abrade, via five strokes, the dorsal ventral and neck surface of the skin of each snake. Bandages with O. ophidiicola agar blocks were placed on each abrasion site to inoculate the skin for 72 h before being removed. Animals in the sham control group received the same treatment although sterile SDA blocks were applied to the bandages. Every seven days, samples were collected of the epidermal microbiome for all study snakes. Aseptic technique was used whenever work was conducted in and around the mesocosms to ensure that O. ophidiicola and other microbes were not transferred between enclosures. The swabbing protocol used to collect microbial samples involved wetting a rayon-tipped sterile applicator (Puritan 10808-146; VWR) with Millipore water that had been autoclaved for two hours. The applicator was then rolled using a stroking motion over a 15 cm portion of the snake’s midbody 15 times to standardize the sampled grain size22,55. All swab samples were stored at -20 °C until DNA extraction. This study was completed under IACUC MTSU-19-3012 approval and carried out according to relevant animal care and ARRIVE guidelines.

Quantifying pathogen load

DNA was extracted from swab samples using the DNeasy PowerSoil kit (Qiagen) per the manufacturer’s protocol (n = 144 total samples). On each 96 well plate, a single DNA control blank was extracted to filter out contamination during qPCR and bioinformatic analyses. Pathogen load was measured using qPCR of the ITS gene marker of O. ophidiicola54. Quantitative PCR reactions and criteria for detection of positive samples followed the methods described in Walker et al.22. To determine pathogen load within each sample, a serial dilution of 1–1 × 1010 copies of a synthetic DNA fragment representing the qPCR target sequence (gBlock; Integrated DNA Technologies) was used to generate a standard curve.

Amplicon sequencing and bioinformatics

To characterize microbial assemblages, a 250 bp region of the 16S rRNA marker was PCR amplified using primers 515F and 806R56. Amplicons were dual indexed following Fadrosh et al.57. Indexed amplicons were selected based on fragment size to remove adapter dimers using HighPrep magnetic beads (MagBio Genomics). The concentration of each library was quantified using a Quantus fluorometer (Promega), normalized, and pooled before sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform (2 × 250 bp paired end reads). Mothur v1.43.0 was used to conduct bioinformatic analyses according to the MiSeq SOP58,59 with several modifications. After forming contigs, screen.seqs was used to remove primers and barcodes. Sequences with a minimum of 248 bp and maximum length of 256 bp were then selected for downstream analysis. Sequences with ambiguous base calls and homopolymers greater than eight were removed from the data set. Remaining sequences were aligned to the SILVA v132 reference alignment60,61. The data were denoised using pre.cluster to merge sequences with two or fewer nucleotide differences. The chimera.vsearch command was used to remove chimeric sequences using the parameter ‘template = self’. Sequences identified as chloroplast, mitochondria, unknown, Archaea or Eukarya were removed from the dataset. Sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at 97% similarity using the cluster.split command. OTUs identified in negative control sequencing blanks (1602 total OTUs) were removed from the final data set. Rare OTUs (< 5) were removed using the remove.rare command and ‘bygroup = T’ option to remove any OTU that had fewer than the threshold sequences (< 5) on a per sample basis. Rarefaction of assemblages, based on total sequence reads, is typically conducted on a per sample basis in order to normalize ‘sampling effort’ across samples62. Therefore, we subsampled our data at 1102 sequence reads to generate a final rarefied abundance dataset that was imported into R v3.6.3 for statistical analysis63.

Analysis of pathogen load

Analysis of qPCR data was restricted to positive samples from the inoculated treatment group. This allowed us to test hypotheses regarding changes in pathogen load. Specifically, we tested if time before an inoculated animal experienced mortality (natural or euthanasia) was predictive of O. ophidiicola copy number (fungal load). Modeling was accomplished using linear mixed effects models in nlme. We natural log transformed the copy number data to meet model assumptions of normality. We included days prior to mortality, mortality type (natural or euthanasia), and their interaction as fixed effects. Snake identity was included as a random effect and log copy number as the response variable. Death was defined as the date at which an individual experienced mortality over the clinical trial or was euthanized because the experiment concluded. Model fit was characterized using manual review of model residuals. Model selection was performed using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to determine if the inclusion of a random effect, temporal autocorrelation, and/or unequal variance term was appropriate64. A model was considered superior to another model iteration if the associated AIC value of that model was > 2 below the less complex model. In instances where there was not a difference of > 2, the simpler model was selected.

We also tested for the effect of experimental time on pathogen load. For this model, we included experimental time, mortality type, and their interaction as fixed effect terms, whereas log copy number was the response variable. Snake identity was included as a random effect. Model selection was performed as described above. Neither a temporal autocorrelation nor unequal variance term was indicated for inclusion in either model. Analysis of variance with type-II sum of squares (Wald χ2 statistics; car package) was used to determine the significance of the fixed effects while accounting for unequal sample sizes among snakes due to differential mortality65.

Analysis of alpha diversity

We employed a generalized additive mixed effects model, via the function gam from the software package mgcv, to test if time had linear or non-linear effects on the richness of the host microbiome. Our model formula specified richness as the response variable. Time, treatment group, and mortality type (natural or euthanasia) were designated as fixed effects. The effect of time was modeled separately for each treatment group. Basis complexity (k) was limited to four to prevent model overfitting66. Random effects were specified using the ‘bs = re’ argument to the smoothing function. Akaike Information Criterion values were used to determine the most efficient random effects structure, distribution function, transformation link, and if the inclusion of a temporal autocorrelation term was appropriate64. Shannon-diversity (H) was calculated using the diversity function with the argument “index = shannon” in vegan. We then used a generalized additive mixed effects model in the same manner described above. Shannon-evenness index (E) was calculated by computing the exponential function (ex) of an assemblage’s Shannon-diversity and dividing that by the assemblage’s OTU richness67. In the same manner as the other diversity metrics, a generalized additive mixed effects model was used to make inferences regarding this metric. Since four of seven sham control snakes died during the experiment, we generated generalized additive mixed effects models in order to determine the effect of time on alpha diversity, according to mortality type (natural or euthanasia) within the sham treatment group. More specifically, we generated three models corresponding to each of the measures of alpha diversity examined in this study: OTU richness, Shannon diversity, and Shannon evenness. In each model, a measure of alpha diversity was specified as the response variable. Time and mortality type (natural or euthanasia) were designated as fixed effects. The effect of time was modeled as a smooth term separately for each level of mortality type. Basis complexity (k) was limited to four to prevent model overfitting. Random effects were specified using the ‘bs = re’ argument to the smoothing function. The function gam.check from the package mgcv was used to ensure that sufficient basis complexity was supplied to all fixed effects terms. Restricted maximum likelihood was used to estimate smoothing parameters by specifying “REML” to the method argument. Stepwise AIC selection, as described above, was used to determine inclusion of a random effect, alternative distribution, and/or temporal autocorrelation terms.

Analysis of β-diversity

We applied the Jaccard, Bray–Curtis, and Raup-Crick dissimilarity indices metric to our dataset using the functions vegdist and raupcrick from the package vegan. The Jaccard index treats compositional data as presence/absence, and therefore, rare species have a greater effect on measured dissimilarity51. The Bray–Curtis index accounts for species abundance, and therefore, rare species have less of an effect on measured dissimilarity51. The Raup-Crick metric is a presence/absence community dissimilarity metric, which generates a null expectation for the number of shared species between communities by relating global site occupancy of taxa to local site occupancy probabilities, and then accounting for sampling bias likely to occur due to differences in richness between sites38. Using this metric, one is able to explicitly account for differences in richness on measured community dissimilarity38. The function betadisper in vegan was used to generate distance-to-centroid values for each of these community dissimilarity metrics. Communities were grouped by the interaction of experimental time and treatment group. Thus, a multivariate centroid against which distance-to-centroid values can be calculated was created for each treatment group separately at all time points. Distance-to-centroid values were then evaluated using linear mixed effects modeling with the function lme from the package nlme. Distance-to-centroid values for each dissimilarity metric were used as the response variable while the fixed effects structure of all three models consisted of treatment group, time, their interaction, and mortality type. Stepwise AIC selection, as described above, was used to determine if the inclusion of a random effect, temporal autocorrelation, and/or unequal variance term was appropriate. An analysis of variance with type-II sum of squares (Wald χ2 statistics; car package) was used to determine the significance of the fixed effects. A post-hoc assessment of any significant interaction terms was performed using the gls function from nlme. For post-hoc assessments, each treatment group was modeled independently to determine the relationship between multivariate dispersion and time on a per treatment basis.

Analysis of assemblage composition

The function adonis in vegan was used to conduct Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance on distance matrices generated via the dissimilarity metrics above. The specified fixed effect terms included treatment group, time, their interaction, and mortality type. A statistically significant interaction term would indicate average microbiome composition of each treatment group changed in a disparate fashion through time. For all adonis models, animal ID was specified as a grouping variable (using “strata = ”) to constrain permutations and account for repeated measures (see Supplementary Material, Methods Section for additional detail on all methods).","Analysis of pathogen loadAnalysis of qPCR data was restricted to positive samples from the inoculated treatment group.
We included days prior to mortality, mortality type (natural or euthanasia), and their interaction as fixed effects.

In 1970, a Wisconsin dermatologist first documented what would soon be called Lyme disease across the country.

Dr. Rudolph J. Scrimenti, a dermatologist in Milwaukee, reported the first case in the United States of the signature rash of early Lyme disease.

The patient had removed a tick from his skin three months earlier in north-central Wisconsin. Scrimenti treated the patient with penicillin based on medical literature he had read out of Europe.

“The patient became symptom-free within 48 hours,” he wrote in the journal article in 1970. “There has been no recurrence of symptoms for the past year.” However, Scrimenti said the cause of the disease was “uncertain.”

Scrimenti, who died in 2013, later began treating patients in Milwaukee and served on the review board of a journal on tick-borne diseases in the early 1990s.

Over the past three decades, Susan Paskewitz, a medical entomologist at University of Wisconsin-Madison, has documented the growing prevalence of ticks in Wisconsin.

Paskewitz found that deer ticks, also called black-legged ticks, have moved steadily from northwest to southwest, and then into the central and eventually slowly into the eastern and southern Wisconsin.

“They invaded our state entirely,” Paskewitz said in a 2021 Wednesday Nite @ The Lab episode. She said the regeneration of forests decimated by logging in the early 1900s and rebounding of the deer population are the main drivers in Wisconsin. Paskewitz said warming temperatures caused by climate change are expected to lengthen the tick season and accelerate their northward march into Canada.

Xia Lee, a tick biologist in Paskewitz’s lab, has studied the insects for more than a decade. Lee is soft-spoken, but when he talks about the parasites, he marvels at their “beauty.”

Lee explained that the Lyme-bearing ticks live between two and three years. They acquire blood meals from animal hosts at each stage of life — larva, nymph and adult.

“These guys are always born uninfected, and they have to pick up the infections when they feed on their first animal (hosts),” Lee said, pointing to the lab-raised larvae.

He said that larvae pick up pathogens during their first blood meal from infected small mammals, such as the white-footed mouse. They subsequently transmit those pathogens during their second meal as nymphs and their third meal as adults.

A Yale study has found that about 20% to 30% of the black-legged tick nymphs carry the bacterium that causes Lyme disease in southern New England, while the rate of infected adult ticks is 30% to 50%. The tick can also be infected with other microbes at the same time, carrying and transmitting other pathogens and making people sick with Lyme and other tick-borne diseases such as anaplasmosis and babesiosis.

Lee hopes to develop a Lyme disease vaccine for mice, which spread the disease to ticks that feed on them and later infect humans. (Coburn Dukehart / Wisconsin Watch)

Once an infected tick latches on a human, it falls off when full. If a tick is removed within 24 hours, the likelihood of transmission is very low, Lee said. However, when a poppy seed-sized nymphal tick firmly attaches itself to the skin, detecting and removing it is difficult, increasing the risk of infection.

Lee noted that Wisconsin never got the proper recognition as the site of the first case of the disease. That honor went to the town of Lyme in Connecticut, which remains one of the states with the highest incidence rates in the country.

“We like to joke about it and say that Wisconsin was actually the first state where Lyme disease was detected,” he said, “but we never got the glory for naming (it).”

The recent approvals of aducanumab and lecanamab, targeting amyloid beta, a key pathogenic hallmark of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), represent an impressive step forward in developing new treatment options for one of the most devastating neurological diseases. AD impacts over 5 million individuals in the United States and an estimated 20-24 million people globally. Moreover, AD represents the sixth leading cause of death and according to the Alzheimer’s Association approximately one in three individuals will die with either AD or a related dementia. (1)

What are Alzheimer’s Disease therapeutics?

AD is a progressive, incurable neurodegenerative condition characterized by dementia and overall mental deterioration leading to deficiencies in memory, speech, language, and ultimately death. AD is pathologically characterized by the deposition of aggregated proteins called amyloid beta within the brain, forming structures known as amyloid plaques. These amyloid plaques have long been considered primary drivers of AD pathology. For this reason, many Alzheimer’s Disease therapeutics programs have focused on targeting amyloid beta and amyloid plaques. Drugs including aducanumab and lecanamab are excellent examples of amyloid-targeting therapeutics. From a biological viewpoint, neutralizing amyloid pathology would be of logical benefit to reducing AD pathology and symptoms. Unfortunately, although these drugs represent an immense progression in AD therapies, they do not display the broad sweeping efficacy that was originally hoped for. During clinical trials, lecanamab was significantly more efficacious than aducanumab slowing clinical decline by 27% after 18 months of treatment (2). It is important to reiterate that this level of effect has not been seen with any Alzheimer’s Disease therapeutics to date. Again, it is substantial progress in therapeutic options, but AD remains incurable.

While drugs, including lecanamab and other amyloid therapies, are showing promise both in preclinical studies and now in the clinic, the disease persists. Is targeting amyloid the end of all of AD? Based on clinical evidence today, it’s an excellent start but certainly not the means to an end. Therefore, the question becomes, what’s next?

Do we simply try and improve amyloid therapies? I and many others argue for a complementary pathway alongside amyloid therapies. Many other cellular pathways are now implicated in the pathogenesis of AD and other neurodegenerative conditions, for that matter. Three pathways centric to brain function that are either altered or activated in AD are 1) tau pathology, 2) neuroinflammation, and 3) mitochondrial dysfunction. These pathways were long overlooked as they typically are activated or contribute to AD only after amyloid deposition has already begun years prior. However, new evidence suggests that targeting them could significantly benefit therapeutically.

Tau pathology in Alzheimer’s disease

The first is tau pathology. Tau is a normal protein that helps to maintain the function of nerve cells (neurons). In AD, tau becomes chemically modified in a process called phosphorylation which destabilizes tau and leads to neuronal dysfunction and, eventually, neurodegeneration. Genetic studies show preventing this tau pathology from occurring can preserve neuronal function. Pharmacological targeting of tau has proven to be more challenging as there are many ‘flavors’ of tau, and the proteins that become activated and phosphorylate tau in AD have either been poorly defined or drugs designed to target them have proven promiscuous in nature, resulting in off-target, or unwanted effects. However, new breakthroughs are on the horizon, with new tau immunotherapies entering clinical trials.

The risks of neuroinflammation

The second pathway of potential Alzheimer’s Disease therapeutics value is neuroinflammation. In AD, chronic neuroinflammation is known to promote continued neuronal dysfunction, propagation of tau pathology, and activates cell death and neurodegeneration. New pathways that regulate neuroinflammation have recently been identified, including LC3-associated endocytosis or LANDO (3-5). LANDO-deficiency promotes neuroinflammation and, in models of AD, leads to a robust exacerbation of AD pathology, including neurodegeneration and memory impairment.

Studies using human AD brain samples show the LANDO machinery, along with the autophagy machinery, a cellular homeostasis pathway, are reduced and may contribute to increased inflammation in the AD brain. While re-expressing a whole pathway of regulatory proteins, including those that control LANDO, is not therapeutically viable at present, it is possible to target neuroinflammation. Various novel inflammatory inhibitors are being developed, targeting key inflammatory pathways related to AD, including the NLRP3 inflammasome. Optimistically, we will see compounds targeting neuroinflammation in clinical trials for AD and other neurodegenerative conditions in the coming years.

Regulation of mitochondrial function

The third pathway, which represents a significant Alzheimer’s Disease therapeutics opportunity, is in the regulation of mitochondrial function. Mitochondria are the energy-producing organelles of the cell, and, even more so, are centric signaling hubs for a whole host of cellular communications. The role of dysfunctional mitochondria has been well-characterized in the context of Parkinson’s Disease (PD) and is now coming to light as a key contributor to AD pathogenesis. In AD, mitochondria can become fragmented, leading to failure in energy production, signaling and calcium homeostasis,

a critical component to neuronal function. This can lead to increased neuroinflammation, direct nerve cell dysfunction and loss of signaling. Furthermore, it can directly promote the activation of cell death pathways. Targeting and restoring dysfunctional mitochondria may be the next breakthrough approach to treating AD by restoring cellular function, reducing inflammation, and limiting cell death activation.

What’s next for Alzheimer’s Disease therapeutics?

New therapies are on the horizon, and time will tell if targeting any of these alternative pathways will be of benefit in AD. However, I remain optimistic that the new therapies of tomorrow, paired with those showing great promise in clinics today, will be the means to end Alzheimer’s Disease.

“The results from this study demonstrate that just a single night of exposure to moderate room lighting during sleep can impair glucose and cardiovascular regulation, which are risk factors for heart disease, diabetes and metabolic syndrome,” said Phyllis Zee, MD, PhD, chief of Sleep Medicine in The Ken and Ruth Davee Department of Neurology, a Northwestern Medicine physician and senior author of the study. “It’s important for people to avoid or minimize the amount of light exposure during sleep.”

There is already evidence that light exposure during daytime increases heart rate via activation of the sympathetic nervous system, which kicks your heart into high gear and heightens alertness to meet the challenges of the day.

“Our results indicate that a similar effect is also present when exposure to light occurs during nighttime sleep,” Zee said.

Heart rate increases in light room, and body can’t rest properly

“We showed your heart rate increases when you sleep in a moderately lit room,” said Daniela Grimaldi, MD, PhD, co-first author of the study and a research assistant professor of Neurology in the Division of Sleep Medicine. “Even though you are asleep, your autonomic nervous system is activated. That’s bad. Usually, your heart rate together with other cardiovascular parameters are lower at night and higher during the day.”

There are sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems that regulate our physiology during the day and night. Sympathetic takes charge during the day and parasympathetic is supposed to control physiology at night, when it conveys restoration to the entire body.

How nighttime light during sleep can lead to diabetes and obesity

Investigators found insulin resistance occurred the morning after people slept in a light room. Insulin resistance is when cells in your muscles, fat and liver don’t respond well to insulin and can’t use glucose from your blood for energy. To make up for it, your pancreas makes more insulin. Over time, your blood sugar goes up.

An earlier study published in JAMA Internal Medicine looked at a large population of healthy people who had exposure to light during sleep. They were more overweight and obese, Zee said.

“Now we are showing a mechanism that might be fundamental to explain why this happens. We show it’s affecting your ability to regulate glucose,” Zee said.

The participants in the study weren’t aware of the biological changes in their bodies at night.

“But the brain senses it,” Grimaldi said. “It acts like the brain of somebody whose sleep is light and fragmented. The sleep physiology is not resting the way it’s supposed to.”

Exposure to artificial light at night during sleep is common

Exposure to artificial light at night during sleep is common, either from indoor light emitting devices or from sources outside the home, particularly in large urban areas. A significant proportion of individuals (up to 40 percent) sleep with a bedside lamp on or with a light on in the bedroom, or keep a television on.

Light and its relationship to health is double edged.

“In addition to sleep, nutrition and exercise, light exposure during the daytime is an important factor for health, but during the night we show that even modest intensity of light can impair measures of heart and endocrine health,” Zee said.

The study tested the effect of sleeping with 100 lux (moderate light) compared to 3 lux (dim light) in participants over a single night. The investigators discovered that moderate light exposure caused the body to go into a higher alert state. In this state, the heart rate increases as well as the force with which the heart contracts and the rate of how fast the blood is conducted to your blood vessels for oxygenated blood flow.

“These findings are important particularly for those living in modern societies where exposure to indoor and outdoor nighttime light is increasingly widespread,” Zee said.

Zee’s top tips for reducing light during sleep

Don’t turn lights on. If you need to have a light on (which older adults may want for safety), make it a dim light that is closer to the floor. Color is important. Amber or a red or orange light is less stimulating for the brain. Don’t use white or blue light and keep it far away from the sleeping person. Blackout shades or eye masks are good if you can’t control the outdoor light. Move your bed so the outdoor light isn’t shining on your face.

Is my room too light?

“If you’re able to see things really well, it’s probably too light,” Zee said.

The association's annual ""Stress in America"" poll, published Thursday, found that U.S. adults — already weary from two years of the Covid-19 pandemic — are now overwhelmingly troubled by inflation and the war in Ukraine.

According to the results, 87 percent of those surveyed cited rising costs of everyday items, such as groceries and gas, as a ""significant source of stress.""

The same high percentage said their mental health was greatly affected by what has felt like a ""constant stream of crises without a break over the last two years."" And 84 percent said the Russian invasion of Ukraine is ""terrifying to watch.""

The shared feeling of stress among so many Americans was ""startling,"" said Lynn Bufka, a clinical psychologist and the APA's associate chief for practice transformation. While many people can feel stress, she said, they often cite different political or social reasons as the source.

""We don't usually see 80 percent of people telling us that a particular stressor is stressful for that many individuals,"" Bufka said.

The poll surveyed a nationally representative group of 3,012 U.S. adults. It was initially conducted in mid-February, just ahead of the two-year anniversary of the start of the pandemic. At that time, respondents were overwhelmingly concerned about finances, and particularly stressed about inflation.

Sixty-five percent said they were stressed about money and the economy — the highest percentage recorded since 2015.

Then Russia invaded Ukraine.

Americans were ""already in an overwhelmed and depleted place,"" said Lindsey McKernan, an associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee. The invasion, she said, was a ""new threat to our safety.""

In order to get the most accurate picture of stress in America, the researchers set out to do a second poll, with questions specific to Russia and Ukraine. The second round of polling, conducted March 1 through 3, included 2,051 adults.

Eighty percent of respondents said they were concerned about potential retaliation from Russia, either through cyberattacks or nuclear threats. And 69 percent said they feared they were witnessing the beginning stages of what could be World War III.

Beyond pinpointing the sources of stress for Americans, the poll also delved into how that stress impacted their physical health. Nearly a quarter of the respondents said they tried to cope with pandemic stress by drinking more alcohol. And 58 percent had undesired weight fluctuations, either gaining or losing more weight than they'd wanted.

Parents are 'maxed out'

Parents and caregivers, in particular, have been hit hard by stress in the past year, the APA poll found. Parents are not only worried for themselves; they are overly concerned for the future of their children.

More than 70 percent of parents said they were fearful that the pandemic has impacted kids' social, academic and emotional development. And 68 percent said they were concerned about children's cognitive and physical development.

""This is a particularly difficult time for parents right now,"" Bufka said. They are ""maxed out, overwhelmed and dealing with their own stuff.""

Among parents of teenagers, 65 percent said they felt their children could have benefited from seeing a counselor or other mental health professional throughout the pandemic.

""As parents, our job is to try to get these little people to healthy adults and give them the skills they need to move forward,"" Bufka said. ""We are in uncharted territory about how to do that.""

Both Bufka and McKernan said they hoped that despite the pressure, people remember that they are not alone.

""We all want to have a society where we feel safe and comfortable,"" Bufka said. ""I may not agree with another parent in terms of their stance on masks or no masks, but I do agree with this parent that they are concerned about the well-being of their kids, as am I.""

McKernan agreed.

""Stress can feel really isolating,"" she said. ""But this is one thing that is being experienced by most everybody.""

Researchers at the University of Arizona College of Medicine – Tucson have developed a new way to provide earlier diagnosis of lung disease.

The method involves analyzing metabolites, small molecules that are produced through cellular metabolic reactions. When normal cells transform into diseased cells, their metabolic processes change, and thus their metabolites also change.

Many diseases have a unique metabolite ""fingerprint."" The UArizona-developed technology uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to identify these fingerprints, potentially identifying diseases earlier than methods currently used.

Ruslan Rafikov and Dr. Olga Rafikova, both associate professors of medicine at the college, developed the technology through research funded by the National Institutes of Health.

""We were originally working to understand what metabolic changes happen in cells in pulmonary vascular diseases,"" Rafikov said. ""We were investigating the different pathways involved, and we found that metabolic changes precede disease manifestation. Each disease has a different metabolite fingerprint, and AI helps us find the differences. We do a robust statistical analysis to develop a cellular circulation metabolic profile, and that profile reflects what is going in the body.""

Working with Tech Launch Arizona, the UArizona office that commercializes inventions stemming from university research, the researchers strategized and launched a startup, MetFora, and licensed the technology from the university to advance toward making it available for doctors and patients.

""We're excited to see the MetFora team taking this innovation forward,"" said Douglas Hockstad, assistant vice president of TLA. ""Following through to ensure the products of their research move out of the lab and into the public sphere where they can improve lives is a testament to the UArizona spirit of impact.""

To prepare the startup for a successful launch, the team was awarded funding through the TLA Asset Development Program, which advances early-stage inventions and readies them for licensing. The team also completed the local NSF I-Corps Program at TLA, which helps scientists and engineers maximize the impact of their research through customer discovery and basic business modeling. Following that success, MetFora was accepted into and participated in the national NSF I-Corps Program, which builds on the local program and further helps researchers gain insights into entrepreneurship and starting a business.

Martin Fuchs, an entrepreneur who has launched two other technology companies, is the CEO of MetFora. He was introduced to the UArizona team through his work as a volunteer at Arizona FORGE, an office that helps foster entrepreneurship across the UArizona campus.

""We need better tools to diagnose disease,"" Fuchs said. ""We can help patients much more effectively if we can diagnose them earlier. That's the key – to give doctors and patients the answers early on.""

Fuchs said there are a few other companies working to leverage metabolic information to diagnose disease, but MetFora is unique in its initial focus on lung diseases like pulmonary hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and interstitial lung disease, along with cancer.

""Even though we're focusing on lung disease, we're excited that there's so much opportunity to expand our impact,"" Fuchs said. ""The team's preliminary studies have shown that the technology has the potential for application to a broad spectrum of diseases.""

MetFora is one of four medical technology companies that will be pitching at Venture Madness, an event organized by Invest Southwest and held in Phoenix in March. The competition is open to early-stage and emerging companies and offers participants exclusive access to active, accredited angel investors and venture capital firms from around the country, as well as a cash prize.","UArizona researchers develop AI-driven method for diagnosing lung disease Metabolite technology developed in the College of Medicine – Tucson has been licensed to startup MetFora.

Something to Think About

Warmer days are almost here, and the snow will hopefully disappear someday soon. . That can only mean one thing: Spring is on its way!

Before we know it, green grass, buds on trees and flowers popping through the ground will confirm that the warm breezes of the new season will lift everyone’s spirits. Ah, but alas, with all the joy of spring comes the return of some of those dreaded bugs, in particular, the tick.

As we all start to spend more time outdoors, being aware that ticks are soon to reappear and being vigilant will become, once again, part of the daily routine upon your return to indoors. Ticks acquire Lyme and other tick-borne diseases from infected animals and pass them along to humans and animals.

More coverage:Ticks in Monroe, Pike counties more likely to carry Lyme disease than state average

Ticks are tiny arachnids that cannot jump or fly, but live in grass, leaf matter and wood. They latch onto your feet or lower legs, crawling upwards on your body seeking warm dark areas to attach to. Common ticks in Pennsylvania are the Blacklegged “Deer” tick, American Dog tick, Groundhog tick and the Lone Star tick.

If you have lived here for any amount of time, you know that ticks are a part of our more “country” living. Recent information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has shown that Pennsylvania is No. 1 in confirmed cases of Lyme disease.

Lyme disease is a bacterial infection transmitted to humans primarily through the bites of infected deer ticks. It is the fastest growing vector-borne infectious disease in the United States according to the CDC.

Lyme disease symptoms and treatment

Just a quick reminder about the symptoms of Lyme disease. The initial symptoms may occur within a day or week. Often people think they just have the flu or a virus. The symptoms include fever, headache, general achiness, swollen glands, fatigue and a possible rash. The most common indicator is a bulls-eye rash, but it may also present in other forms like a round or oval reddish rash. If a bulls-eye rash is seen, it is a definite diagnosis and treatment should begin immediately.

Early treatment can save a great deal of pain and suffering. Treatment for early localized disease is a simple 10- to 14-day course of oral antibiotics to eliminate the infection. Some of the medications used to treat Lyme disease as first line treatments include: doxycycline, amoxicillin and cefuroxime, although studies are always underway for new drugs.

Prevent Lyme disease

Lyme and other tick-borne diseases can be serious, but also preventable by avoiding high risk tick habitat areas. When walking along a path, walk in the middle. The safest place. Wear proper clothing. Wear light-colored long pants, long sleeved shirts and closely knitted socks. Tuck shirts into pants and tuck pants into socks. This will prevent a tick from crawling under clothing. Wear a kerchief and hat to protect your neck and head.

Use repellent. There are a variety of tick repellents available today. For the most effective tick bite prevention, products with active ingredients of DEET, Picaridin, Oil of Lemon Eucalyptus (OLE) or Permethrin have proven most effective. The CDC recommends using products containing these ingredients that are registered with the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency. (EPA). Studies have shown that people who wore Permethrin treated sneakers and socks were 74 times less likely to have a tick bite.

Finally, do a thorough check of yourself, your children and your pets when returning after outdoor activities. If you find a tick remove it immediately. Use fine-tipped tweezers to grasp the tick as close to the skin’s surface as possible. Pull upward with steady, even pressure. Don’t twist or turn the tick, this can cause the mouth parts to break off and remain in the skin. After removing the tick, clean the bite area and your hands with rubbing alcohol or soap and water. A live tick can be killed by putting it in alcohol, place it in a sealed bag, wrapping it in tape or flushing down the toilet.

If you want to find out if the tick was infected with Lyme disease, test kits are available in stores. Locally, you can check at the East Stroudsburg University Innovation Center located on Independence Road in East Stroudsburg.

So, welcome spring and all its glory, but be aware and prepared!

East Stroudsburg University Tick Lab

Monroe County's East Stroudsburg University is home to the Dr. Jane Huffman Wildlife Genetics Institute, and the Pennsylvania Tick Lab, a leading laboratory specializing in the study of tick-borne illness. The lab provides free tick testing.

The lab can test submitted samples for 17 diseases, including Lyme.

At the time of this story, the lab had tested more than 49,000 tick samples submitted from across the commonwealth. In Monroe County, more than 3,300 ticks have been tested, along with 2,399 in Pike, 930 in Wayne, over 300 in Carbon and more than 1,000 in Lackawanna.

As a result, there will be some supply disruption from the farm in coming weeks, said the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) in response to queries from The Straits Times on Friday (Feb 25).

However, SFA stressed that the disease is not a food safety concern.

""There are no known instances of transmission to humans through handling or consumption of poultry products, and eggs from Seng Choon can continue to be sold,"" it said.

Seng Choon Farm managing director Koh Yeow Koon said the first signs of the disease appeared last week, when there was a dip in egg production.

Laboratory test results from the Animal Veterinary Service (AVS) confirmed Newcastle disease, which affects the respiratory, nervous and digestive systems of birds.

The disease, which is endemic in the region, has resulted in a 40 per cent to 50 per cent drop in egg production, said Mr Koh. The farm typically produces about 600,000 eggs daily, about 10 per cent of Singapore's supply.

Mr Koh said the farm will be conducting more frequent cleaning to prevent the disease from spreading, and also relook the vaccination programme for its chickens, such as by giving them additional shots.

""The chickens will recover and egg supply will gradually resume,"" he said, adding that egg supply is expected to recover in about one to two months.

Both SFA and AVS have been working closely with Seng Choon to manage the disease situation.

SFA said it has also been engaging the other two egg farms which supply the local market - Chew's Agriculture and N&N Agriculture - to step up their biosecurity measures.

While a temporary supply disruption is to be expected from Seng Choon, Singapore's sources of hen shell eggs remains diverse.

About 70 per cent of Singapore's hen shell egg supply is made up of imports from countries such as Malaysia, Thailand, Australia, Spain and Poland, said SFA.

""In view of the Seng Choon situation, SFA has been in contact with egg importers, some of whom are actively responding to release more stocks from their buffer into the market and to ramp up imports,"" added the agency.","SINGAPORE - Seng Choon Farm, one of Singapore's three largest egg farms here, has seen an outbreak of Newcastle disease, a viral disease among poultry that can cause a temporary drop in hens' egg production.

483,483,https://www.genengnews.com/topics/omics/single-nanopore-sequencing-test-can-diagnose-50-genetic-diseases/,Nanopore Sequencing Test Can Diagnose 50 Genetic Diseases,"Researchers at the Garvan Institute of Medical Research in Sydney and collaborators in Australia, the U.K., and Israel have developed a DNA test that studies suggest can identify a range of hard-to-diagnose neurological and neuromuscular genetic diseases faster and more accurately than existing methods. The diseases covered by the new test belong to a class of over 50 disorders caused by unusually long repetitive DNA sequences in a person’s genes—known as short tandem repeat (STR) expansion disorders.

Using a single DNA sample, usually extracted from blood, the test works by scanning a patient’s genome using Nanopore sequencing technology, from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). “We correctly diagnosed all patients with conditions that were already known, including Huntington’s disease, fragile X syndrome, hereditary cerebellar ataxias, myotonic dystrophies, myoclonic epilepsies, motor neuron disease, and more,” said Ira Deveson, PhD, head of genomics technologies at the Garvan Institute. “They are often difficult to diagnose due to the complex symptoms that patients present with, the challenging nature of these repetitive sequences, and limitations of existing genetic testing methods.” The team aims to start validations so that the test can ultimately be made available in pathology services around the world.

Deveson is senior author of the researchers’ reported study, which is published in Science Advances, and titled, “Comprehensive genetic diagnosis of tandem repeat expansion disorders with programmable targeted nanopore sequencing.”

An STR is a short DNA sequence motif, typically 2 to 6 base pairs, repeated consecutively at a given position in the genome, the authors explained. STRs make up ~7% of the human genome sequence and are highly polymorphic, commonly varying in length between unrelated individuals. “Unusually long or ‘expanded’ STR alleles are an important class of pathogenic variants in human populations,” the team continued. “To date, STR expansions in more than 40 genes have been shown to cause heritable disorders, with the majority of these exhibiting primary neurological or neuromuscular presentations … With each of the >40 STR-associated neurogenetic diseases estimated to affect ~1 to 10 individuals per 100,000, their collective prevalence is high.” In fact, the list of disorders in which STR expansions have been implicated is growing, the team noted.

Repeat expansion disorders can be passed on through families, and can be life threatening. However, current genetic testing for expansion disorders can be “hit and miss,” said Kishore Kumar, MD, a co-author of the study and clinical neurologist at Concord Hospital. “When patients present with symptoms, it can be difficult to tell which of these 50-plus genetic expansions they might have, so their doctor must decide which genes to test for based on the person’s symptoms and family history. If that test comes back negative, the patient is left without answers. This testing can go on for years without finding the genes implicated in their disease. We call this the ‘diagnostic odyssey,’ and it can be quite stressful for patients and their families.”

Although repeat expansion disorders cannot be cured, a quicker diagnosis can help doctors identify and treat disease complications earlier, such as heart issues associated with Friedreich’s ataxia.

For their newly developed test, based on targeted long-read sequencing, the investigators harnessed ONT’s “ReadUntil” functionality, whereby, they explained, the ONT sequencing device can be programmed to recognize and accept/reject specific DNA sequence fragments during the sequencing experiment. “Target selection is fully flexible and requires no additional laboratory processes beyond standard library preparation. Here, we demonstrate that ONT ReadUntil can be used to achieve accurate molecular characterization of all known neuropathogenic STRs in a single assay.”

The Nanopore technology used in this newly developed test approach is also smaller and cheaper than standard tests. The team hopes that this will aid uptake into pathology labs. “With Nanopore, the gene sequencing device has been reduced from the size of a fridge to the size of a stapler, and costs around $1000, compared with hundreds of thousands needed for mainstream DNA sequencing technologies, commented Deveson.

Kumar continued, “We’ve programmed the Nanopore device to hone in on the roughly 40 genes known to be involved in these disorders and to read through the long, repeated DNA sequences that cause disease. By unraveling the two strands of DNA and reading the repeated letter sequences (combinations of A, T, G, or C), we can scan for abnormally long repeats within the patient’s genes, which are the hallmarks of disease.”

Deveson added, “In the one test, we can search for every known disease-causing repeat expansion sequence, and potentially discover novel sequences likely to be involved in diseases that have not yet been described.”

The team expects to see the new technology used in diagnostic practice within the next two to five years. One of the key steps towards that goal is to gain appropriate clinical accreditation for the method. Once accredited, the test will also transform research into genetic diseases, the authors suggested. “While the potential benefits for genetic diagnosis of patients with STR expansion disorders are clear, targeted STR sequencing will be similarly useful as a research tool. STRs are highly polymorphic and exhibit pathogenicity through an array of different mechanisms.”

Gina Ravenscroft, PhD, a co-author of the study and a researcher working on rare disease genetics at the Harry Perkins Institute of Medical Research, noted, “Adult-onset genetic disorders haven’t received as much research attention as those that appear in early life. By finding more people with these rare adult-onset diseases, and those who may be pre-symptomatic, we’ll be able to learn more about a whole range of rare diseases through cohort studies, which would otherwise be hard to do.”

The scientists commented, “ … by resolving STR expansions that are not amenable to existing techniques, long-read sequencing promises to accelerate the discovery of repeat expansion genes and disorders … Moreover, repeat expansions need not be the only pathogenic variants found by this approach, with targeted long-read sequencing also suitable for the detection of other types of structural variation. We anticipate that this will be a powerful approach to STR gene discovery and provide molecular diagnoses for many previously unsolved cases in the future.”","The diseases covered by the new test belong to a class of over 50 disorders caused by unusually long repetitive DNA sequences in a person’s genes—known as short tandem repeat (STR) expansion disorders.

Newspaper industry in state of decline: not exactly a stop-the-presses headline. For two decades now — owing largely to the loss of advertising revenue to Facebook and Google — fewer and fewer Americans get their news, comics and sports from all those gazettes and tribunes and journals. But that doesn't tell the whole story. There's an additional threat: hedge funds and other financial firms that now own nearly a third of the daily papers in America. And these new owners are often committed not to headlines and deadlines, but to bottom lines. One fund in particular has been called by some in the industry a ""vulture,"" bleeding newspapers dry. It all prompts the question: as local newsrooms and local news coverage shrivel up, to what extent does democracy shrink with it?

Behind the marching band and baton twirlers, at the annual 4th of July parade in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, you'll find a one-man band: reporter Evan Brandt, snapping photos, taking notes, and gathering quotes.

For the last 24 years, he's chronicled this community of 23,000 for the local newspaper, the Mercury, which at one time had dozens of reporters. Now, Brandt is literally the last reporter standing in Pottstown.

Jon Wertheim: When a community like this loses their local reporters. What else are they losing?

Evan Brandt: It reminds us all about shared experiences. You know who died, you know who graduated from high school. You know whose kid had a great game. You know those are all important elements about holding people together.

Jon Wertheim: You're describing the soul of a community?

Evan Brandt: Sure.

Brandt took us to the old headquarters of the Mercury. Punching above its weight, the Mercury won a Pulitzer Prize in 1979 and another in 1990. Now, it looks like this.

The old headquarters of the Mercury in Pottstown, PA.

Evan Brandt: My desk was right about here. And the editor sat up there. The sports guys were along here. The photographers were in the back. Anyone could walk in the front door and say, ""I need to talk to a reporter. My sewer's backing up and the township isn't doing anything about it. Can you do something?""

Behold, the new Mercury headquarters.

Evan Brandt in the new Mercury newsroom, Brandt's attic

Brandt's turned his attic into a command center.

It's here that he scrambles to cover Pottstown, 20 surrounding towns and nine different school districts.

Overworked and overwhelmed, Brandt has seen his industry battered by all sort of forces — disappearing classified ads; people getting news for free online.

But he says the worst culprit is the hedge fund Alden Global Capital, which bought the Mercury in 2011 and has since sold the paper's building and slashed newsroom staff by about 70%. Severe even by the standards of the newspaper sector that has seen an astounding 57% job loss since 2008.

In 2017, after another round of layoffs, Brandt says he felt angry and wanted answers and accountability. So he paid a visit to the Hamptons summer home of Heath Freeman, the 41-year-old president of Alden Global Capital, and knocked on the door.

Jon Wertheim: What'd you want to say to him?

Evan Brandt: What I settled on is, ""What value do you place on local news?"" And I'm not talking about money. ""What value do you place on it?""

Brandt recalls that a woman let him in; behind her, he caught a glimpse of Freeman, who walked away.

Jon Wertheim: You never got to ask him that question.

Evan Brandt: I did not.

Evan Brandt

This secretive hedge fund — their website shows a single photo — started building its print empire over the last decade and now owns more than 200 newspapers, making it the country's second largest newspaper owner behind Gannett.

Alden's rapid takeover and cuts have alarmed U.S. lawmakers. In 2019, 21 senators wrote to Heath Freeman asking him to abandon his ""newspaper-killing business model.""

Freeman, though, has doubled down. Last year Alden made a play for Tribune Publishing, home to historic papers like the Baltimore Sun and the Chicago Tribune.

Gary Marx: This is an attack on our democracy.

Gary Marx and David Jackson spent 30 years as investigative reporters at the Chicago Tribune, a paper that has won 27 Pulitzer Prizes.

Gary Marx: Local and regional newspapers are so important to our communities, to holding our leaders accountable. They're not just going after some business that is trying to make money.

They admit the Tribune had been crippled for years by bad management; but after seeing Alden buy the Denver Post and then gut staff by 70%, the journalists were worried the hedge fund would do irreversible damage.

Jon Wertheim: So what'd you do?

Gary Marx: We fought back. That's what we did. Dave and I just decided that we are gonna throw everything we possibly can, use all our investigative and reportorial skills to save this organization that is so important we felt to the future of the city we love, Chicago.

Gary Marx and David Jackson

So this investigative team–accustomed to exposing corruption and injustice, acting as watchdogs on local government-they turned their attention to their potential new owners.

Jon Wertheim: You've said when Alden Capital arrived, it was an existential threat.

David Jackson: Yeah.

Jon Wertheim: Why is this firm particularly nefarious?

David Jackson: Well, Alden has sort of a playbook of going into a distressed newsroom and selling off the real estate and property, equipment, things like that. And second of all, diminishing the resources that the reporters have.

Leaked company financials show in 2017 Alden built in profit margins as high as 30% at certain papers– more than double industry standard. In recent filings the New York Times company reported 10% profit margins.

David Jackson: These are executives from a hedge fund who live in a very wealthy lifestyle. They're not taking the profits and using them to build the Tribune.

Jon Wertheim: What's your response to someone who'd say, ""Look, this is capitalism""?

David Jackson: Well, we've always been aware that we're doing journalism in a capitalist democracy. And we've always embraced that. But we felt that Alden didn't recognize the civic trust that's embedded in this profit-making machine.

Jackson and Marx say what they learned about Alden only fueled their sense of urgency. So in 2020 — putting their jobs at risk — they wrote an op-ed in the New York Times pleading for a philanthropist, foundation, anyone to step forward to save their paper.

One man tried: Maryland Hotel Magnate Stewart Bainum, a life-long subscriber to the Baltimore Sun. Bainum committed $200 million and we followed him last year scrambling to put together a deal to buy tribune publishing.

Stewart Bainum

Bainum couldn't find a partner. Last May, Alden bought Tribune Publishing for more than $600 million and two days later started offering buyouts to Tribune Employees. More than 40 have since left the Chicago Tribune: including one-fourth of the newsroom.

Freeman declined our repeated requests to sit down with 60 Minutes. But his public relations team sent us letters he wrote to other newspaper owners that state Alden is committed to providing ""robust, independently minded local journalism"" and that it's time for tech giants to start paying for the ""billions of dollars"" they're making off of news publishers' content.

The newspaper crisis didn't begin with Alden; and this is not the only financial firm in this sector. But Alden is often held up as the worst actor. One study conducted by the University of North Carolina in 2018 found that some Alden-owned newspapers had cut staff at twice the rate of their competitors.

Steven Waldman is a former journalist. In 2011, he studied the decline of the local news industry for the Federal Communications Commission.

He says that, in the absence of local reporting, there's evidence of increased corruption by local officials. One example he points to: Bell, California. When the local newspaper there shut down, scandal ensued.

Steve Waldman: The elected officials just kept voting themselves pay raises to the point where the city manager was making $800,000, just because there was no one there.

Jon Wertheim: I'm guessing there's nothing specifically corrupt about Bell, California, that wouldn't replicate in any of 1,000 other towns.

Steve Waldman: Pretty much through all of human history and throughout the world, when you have power that isn't watched, it tends to get abused.

Waldman says it's not just that local news has been hollowed out; it's what has replaced it.

Steve Waldman: The vacuum was filled by national cable news, and social media, and very opinionated, polarizing material.

Steven Waldman

Waldman believes in flooding communities with local reporters. In 2017, he co-founded ""Report for America,"" a program that sends print, radio and television journalists to newsrooms in underserved communities across the country.

We brought together five reporters.

ChrisAnna Mink: I'm ChrisAnna Mink. I'm a pediatrician and also a health reporter.

Camalot Todd: I'm Camalot Todd. I report on mental health for Buffalo.

Amelia Ferrell Knisely: I'm Amelia Ferrell Knisely. I'm an investigative reporter that covers poverty in West Virginia.

Chris Jones, a Marine Corps veteran, covers domestic extremism in Appalachia. Gracyn Doctor covers race and equity in Charlotte.

Five ""Report for America"" reporters. (Back) ChrisAnna Mink and Camalot Todd. (Front) Chris Jones, Gracyn Doctor and Amelia Ferrell Knisely

Jon Wertheim: These studies that show that people trust local media more than national media. Doesn't sound like that surprise you, those results.

Reporters: (LAUGHTER) No!

Chris Jones: These are our neighbors, you know? We're not writing about someone I'm never gonna talk to again. They're people before they're interview subjects.

This is Jones on January 6th. He had cultivated such a level of trust from his sources that he was one of the few reporters covering the insurrectionists as they stormed the U.S. Capitol.

Chris Jones: I got a lot of calls immediately after the 6th from a lot of different, like, news organizations, people who wouldn't answer an email from me, you know, a week prior.

Jon Wertheim: You were the local journal[ist]. You had the sources.

Chris Jones: Yeah.

Jon Wertheim: You had the relationships

Camalot Todd: A lot of national media is coastal and it stays coastal unless there's a big news event. And then they fly their reporters in, write the story, and fly 'em out.

Gracyn Doctor experienced this firsthand. Her mother was one of nine African Americans killed by a white supremacist in the 2015 Mother Emanuel Church shooting in Charleston.

Doctor felt that when the national media parachuted in they were looking for soundbites, instead of examining the deeper questions.

Gracyn Doctor: Especially in a place like Charleston, South Carolina, where, like, the history of racism runs very, very deep. That was the opportunity to really dive into some of that history, you know? Like, why did this happen in this community?

While newspapers like the Washington Post and LA Times have been bought by billionaires, Waldman says addressing this crisis falls to all of us.

Steve Waldman: We need a dramatic increase in the-- the commitment of foundations, and philanthropists, and donors like you and me to actually supporting local news.

Remember Stewart Bainum, who lost out to Alden Global Capital? He's launching ""The Baltimore Banner,"" a nonprofit digital news outlet, to go head-to-head with the Baltimore Sun for subscribers. It will cover only local news with plans, over the next three years, to hire more than 100 reporters.

Jon Wertheim: All digital.

Stewart Bainum: The web. Newsletters. Podcasts. Apps. Wherever people receive their news, we're gonna go there.

After sounding the alarm about Alden Global Capital, Gary Marx and David Jackson left the Chicago Tribune. Jackson is still working as a reporter at a nonprofit newsroom in Chicago. Marx is now living what he calls his second dream job as a high school football coach. They are more convinced than ever that local news cannot become yesterday's news.

Gary Marx: Journalism is one of the most noble professions there is. You can have tremendous impact on society.

David Jackson: I work with a lotta young people. And-- I tell them that the- we're leaving them [with] a smashed and broken system, but that they're gonna have to reinvent it because it's necessary. Journalism is necessary for the survival of American democracy.

As for Heath Freeman, this past summer, he bought a Miami mansion for $19 million, a transaction discovered and reported by a local news outlet.

One of the first projects for the supercomputer will be to help design an algorithm analysing clinical data and heart and retinal scans for heart patients, so that the most urgent cases can be prioritised for emergency treatment. The machine is being developed by the National Supercomputing Centre (NSCC) and SingHealth.

While it will be located at the healthcare cluster's Singapore General Hospital campus, it will be open to all healthcare institutions to use.

Agreements were signed between NSCC, SingHealth and American chipmaker Nvidia for the supercomputer on Tuesday (March 1) at the Supercomputing Asia 2022 event at Suntec convention centre.

Under the agreements, Nvidia will provide access to its software tools and artificial intelligence (AI) models for healthcare research.

The supercomputer is expected to take the AI used by clinicians to make sense of diseases and escalate it. Where standard computers might take days to train the AI using a set of patient data, the supercomputer could do it in hours.

Mr Bernard Tan, NSCC's director for strategy, planning and engagement, said: ""We expect the supercomputer to be up to 100 times the speed of a standard computer.""

Having the supercomputer in-house also saves time as data does not have to be sent to a third-party high-performance computer to be analysed, a process that could take hours to days. To protect patients' privacy, their data will be anonymised so no names and NRIC numbers will be associated with the information.

Beyond healthcare, supercomputers like those from NSCC have been used here in other research areas, including climate change, weather monitoring, urban planning and materials research.

The new supercomputer will also be used to train the AI tool used in Apollo, a national AI project to analyse scans of heart arteries to determine if a patient has cardiovascular disease.

While a radiologist could take several hours to interpret a scan, an analysis could be completed using Apollo in 10 minutes. This would free up time for clinicians to focus on other important work such as caring for patients.

Apollo is a collaboration between SingHealth's National Heart Centre Singapore; Duke-NUS Medical School; the Agency for Science, Technology and Research; National University Hospital and Tan Tock Seng Hospital.

The supercomputer can also train other AI models, such as the one being used for a project to identify ""neoantigens"" - new proteins with mutations found on cancer cells.

By figuring out what these proteins are, researchers can develop vaccines to stimulate the production of antibodies that can target them and kill the cancer cells.

Such precise targeting reduces the side effects of the cancer therapy, unlike conventional cancer treatments that are less precise and may harm non-cancerous cells.","SINGAPORE - A new national supercomputer to speed up healthcare research using large and complex sets of patient data is slated to launch this year.

Epidemiology

Incidence & Prevalence

A number of studies/websites showed that, over time, an increasing proportion of IMD cases were in older adults, which may in part be because of improvements in surveillance programmes and as a consequence of meningitis vaccination campaigns focusing almost exclusively on infants and adolescents. The Meningitis Progress Tracker [83] estimated that the global number of IMD cases had slowly increased in the period 2000–2017 (the latest year reported) in those aged 25–64 years (from 61,760 in 2000 to 72,430 in 2017) but remained relatively stable in those aged ≥ 65 years (from 2,469 in 2000 to 2,422 in 2017). According to recent estimates published as part of the Global Burden of Disease Study [41], the death rate, years of living with a disability (YLD) rate and incidence all increased in the oldest age groups, with meningococcal meningitis and ‘other’ meningitis causing most of the burden in those aged ≥ 80 years. It should be noted that both the Meningitis Progress Tracker and the Global Burden of Disease Study take estimates from the same sources available via the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME).

Data from Europe, available on the ECDC website for IMD [84], showed that whilst the overall numbers of confirmed IMD cases decreased in the EU/EEA area since 1999, the proportion of cases in those aged > 50 years rose markedly from just under 9% in 1999 to 32% in 2018 (the last year for which data are available). This may reflect the success of the meningococcal vaccination program which focused largely on the youngest age groups, shifting the relative burden to older age groups. Studies from several European countries including the UK [42], Finland [85], Italy [43] and Sweden [44] have confirmed the shift in distribution of IMD cases towards older age groups. For example, Stefanelli et al. showed that 52% of the IMD cases occurred among patients aged ≥ 45 years since 2013 [43].

Data from the US CDC [86] for 2018 showed that the IMD incidence rates rose with increasing age from 0.16 per 100,000 in those aged 55–59 years to 0.49 per 100,000 in those aged ≥ 85 years, and those aged > 45 years accounted for 47% (153/329) of confirmed and probable IMD cases reported that year. Of note, only a single US study of men who have sex with men (MSM) was found despite this being a high-risk group for meningococcal disease [45]. Among 74 cases among MSM (0.56 per 100,000) reported to the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System between January 2012 and June 2015, only a single case was in the older adult age group (56–64 years) (0.008 per 100,000).

Serogroups

There were multiple studies/websites that showed infections caused by serogroups W and Y were more common in older adults than in young children and adolescents. According to data from the ECDC [84], the most prevalent serogroup in Europe during the period 1999–2018 was serogroup B (51% of cases and the dominant serogroup in all age groups below 65 years), with serogroups W and Y increasingly more prevalent in older adults over time. This may reflect the impact of serogroup C vaccinations over this period in teenagers and young adults, with some of the older adults benefitting from ‘herd protection’. A three-fold increase in the incidence of IMD caused by serogroup W was observed between 2013 and 2017, primarily because of increased cases in children aged < 5 years and adults aged ≥ 50 years. This increase in the incidence of IMD caused by serogroup W was confirmed by national institutions such as the Institut Pasteur [87] and many studies in European countries including those from the UK [42, 46, 47], Spain [48], Italy [49], the Netherlands [50, 51], and Sweden [44, 52]. One study in Ireland found serogroup Y as the predominant strain in those aged ≥ 65 years [53]. However, another from the Netherlands reported serogroup B as the most prevalent in older adults rather than serogroups W and Y [54].

Data from the CDC [86] showed that serogroup B was the dominant serogroup in the USA in those aged under 23 years, and serogroups A, C, W and Y were the dominant serogroups in adults and older adults (0.07 per 100,000 and 0.15 per 100,000 in those aged 25–64 years and ≥ 65 years, respectively, compared with 0.03 per 100,000 serogroup B infections in those aged 25–64 years). Latest surveillance data from the ABCs program network that included 10 states reported in 2018 that serogroup Y was more common in adults (aged > 35 years) than in younger adults, in whom serogroups B and C were more frequent [88]. Several US studies also found serogroup Y to be more common in older adults [55,56,57], for example, Peruski et al. [56] noted that throughout the period 1988 to 2011, serogroup Y became an increasingly predominant cause of IMD in those aged ≥ 60 years, accounting for over 50% of all serogroups isolated in this age group after 1995. One possible explanation for this apparent increase in serogroup Y is that many of the cases in this age group were pneumonia with or without bacteraemia, and the latter are generally not considered to be cases of IMD. Therefore, underreporting of other serogroups may have caused an apparent increase in serogroup Y cases as a proportion of all cases.

Mortality

Many of the studies showed that case fatality rates (CFRs) were higher in older adults than in younger adults, adolescents and children. Global data over the period 2000 to 2017 from the Meningitis Research Foundation’s Meningitis Progress Tracker [83] showed that the CFR for those aged > 65 years averaged 12% compared with 7% for those aged 25–64 years.

Data from the ECDC [84] (during the period 1999–2018) showed that the CFR in those aged ≥ 50 years remained relatively stable at 17.4–18.4% from 1999 to 2006 but decreased to approximately 14% in recent years. Multiple published studies in Europe also found higher CFRs in older adults, including those from Spain [27, 58, 59], UK [46, 60, 78], Ireland [53], France [61] and the Netherlands [50]. These studies highlighted that existing comorbidities were an additional risk factor, and combining these with increased age may explain the poorer outcome in older adults. Eastern Europe appears to have much higher CFRs –ranging from approximately 3–46% [62, 63]. However, one single study undertaken in the Netherlands during 2015–2018 found higher CFRs in younger, rather than older, adults [51].

The 2018 surveillance report from the CDC [86] in the USA showed higher CFRs in patients aged ≥ 65 years than that in those aged 25–64 years (23.3 per 100 cases vs 14.1 per 100 cases). The CFRs were higher in these two age groups (25–64 and ≥ 65 years) than in any other age group, including infants (overall average CFR was 12.0 per 100 cases). Other US studies support the higher CFRs observed in older adults [55, 56].

CFRs may also be higher in those affected by serogroups W and Y, which as shown previously are more frequently the cause of IMD in older adults. The 2018 surveillance report from the CDC [86] reported higher CFR associated with serogroup W (23.5 per 100 cases with known outcome) than that for any other serogroup (overall CFR was 12.0%). A similar finding was reported in a US study undertaken for the period 1945 to 2010 by Baccarini et al. [57]. Studies in the UK [64] and the Netherlands [65] have also noted higher CFRs associated with serogroup W and Y cases.

Atypical clinical presentation

We identified 20 case reports (12 females, 6 males and 2 cases where sex was not reported) from 17 papers [66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77, 79] concerning patients aged ≥ 55 years (range 55–94 years) presenting with atypical symptoms (often linked to a comorbid condition) including myocarditis/endocarditis and arthritis. Half of the total cases identified were patients living in Europe (n = 11), 2 cases in North America, and 1 case where the location was not disclosed. In each case, IMD was not initially suspected and N. meningitidis was only detected once the patients were admitted to hospital. These case studies highlight the need to be aware of the potential for atypical clinical presentation, to ensure early recognition and treatment and to also allow for susceptibility testing and avoidance of inappropriate antibiotic use and treatment failure. Atypical IMD presentation may be more common in older adults, possibly resulting in delayed diagnosis [47, 78]. In addition, CFRs tended to be higher in those with underlying medical conditions or atypical clinical presentation [27, 57, 63, 80, 81]. There was no mention in any of the case reports of patients having being previously vaccinated.

Clinical burden

Only two studies that reported resource use in older adults with IMD were identified and both (one in the USA and one in Spain) found an increased incidence of hospitalisation among older adults compared with that in younger adults and adolescents [58, 82].","This may reflect the success of the meningococcal vaccination program which focused largely on the youngest age groups, shifting the relative burden to older age groups.
Several US studies also found serogroup Y to be more common in older adults [55,56,57], for example, Peruski et al.
Therefore, underreporting of other serogroups may have caused an apparent increase in serogroup Y cases as a proportion of all cases.

Daily exercise at age 70 may help prevent heart disease later

Exercising for at least 20 minutes daily at age 70 years was associated with reduced risk for CV outcomes later in life, researchers reported in Heart.

The effect was most prominent in men and lessened at age 75, 80 and 85 years, according to the researchers.

Data were derived from Amidei CB, et al. Heart. 2022;doi:10.1136/heartjnl-2021-320013.

Claudio Barbiellini Amidei, MD, preventive medicine specialist in the department of cardio-thoraco-vascular sciences and public health at the University of Padua in Padova, Italy, and colleagues analyzed 2,754 participants aged at least 65 years (mean age, 75 years; 60% women) from the Progetto Veneto Anziani cohort study.

The participants were stratified into the following categories based on physical activity: stable-low, low-increasing, high-decreasing and stable-high. Those who exercised at least 20 minutes per day were categorized as physically active.

The outcome of interest was prevalent and incident CVD, including CHD, HF and stroke.

Rates of incident CHD and HF were lower throughout the study period for physically active men and women compared with those who were not physically active, the researchers wrote.

In a fully adjusted model, physical activity was associated with reduced risk for CVD (adjusted HR = 0.74; 95% CI, 0.58-0.94), CHD (aHR = 0.66; 95% CI, 0.5-0.87) and HF (aHR = 0.72; 95% CI, 0.53-0.98) in men, but not in women, according to the researchers.

In addition, physical activity was associated with reduced risk for all-cause mortality in men (aHR = 0.72; 95% CI, 0.62-0.84) and women (aHR = 0.81; 95% CI, 0.72-0.92), Amidei and colleagues found.

In an analysis by age, physical activity in men was associated with reduced risk for CVD at age 70 years (aHR = 0.58; 95% CI, 0.39-0.84), but the association was attenuated at age 75 years (aHR = 0.74; 95% CI, 0.52-1.05) and not present at all at age 80 and 85 years.

In men, reduced risk for CVD (P for trend = .002), CHD (P for trend = .005) and HF (P for trend = .038) progressively improved from the stable-low group to the stable-high group, Amidei and colleagues wrote.

There was no relationship between physical activity and stroke risk. Adding prevalent cases of CVD at baseline did not change the results.

“When stratifying by age, we found that the association between physical activity and cardiovascular risk was significantly reduced among participants aged 70 years, and with marginal significance at 75 years, while no association was found among the oldest age groups, suggesting greater cardiovascular benefits might be achieved by improving physical activity earlier in late life,” the researchers wrote.

In a related editorial, Enrico Fabris, MD, and Gianfranco Sinagra, MD, both from the University of Trieste, Italy, wrote: “This study reveals important concepts: the persistence of an active life, or an increasing level of physical activity in older people may improve prognosis; however, this potential benefit is mostly evident when an active lifestyle is present early in late life.”

489,489,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/17/bbcs-sarah-smith-relieved-to-escape-scottish-bile-and-hatred,BBC’s Sarah Smith relieved to escape Scottish ‘bile and hatred’,"Sarah Smith, the BBC’s former Scotland editor, has said she feels relieved to have left the country after enduring years of misogynistic “bile and hatred” while covering Scottish politics.

Smith, the recently appointed North America editor for BBC News, said she repeatedly experienced gendered abuse while doing her job, which led her to significantly reduce her use of Twitter and to fear she had become a visible target.

Born and educated in Edinburgh, she said she believed much of the abuse came from nationalists because her father was John Smith, the UK Labour party leader who died in 1994. He was a notable critic of Scottish independence.

In remarks published by the Reuters Institute, Smith said: “He was a very well known politician, he was a unionist, people like to therefore assume that my politics must be the same as my father’s, despite me being, one, a different person, and him having been dead for 27 years.”

People would “roll their car windows down as they drive past me in the street to ask me ‘what fucking lies you’re going to be telling on TV tonight, you fucking lying bitch’,” she told Rhys Evans, a BBC Wales executive.

That “vitriolic attention” occurred routinely while she prepared for live broadcasts in public. Smith said she “pretty much stopped tweeting” because she feared attracting “shit I can live without”.

An experienced reporter for the BBC, 5 News and Channel 4 News, including a stint as US business correspondent, Smith was appointed as the corporation’s first Scotland editor in 2016, following the 2014 independence referendum. She also anchored current affairs programmes, including Sunday Politics.

Named as the BBC’s North America editor in November last year, succeeding Jon Sopel, Smith told Evans she was relieved to be leaving Scotland. In the US she would be “gloriously anonymous”.

“Nobody will have any idea who my father is. So the misogynistic idea that I can’t have any of my own thoughts anyway, or rise above my family connections to report impartially, will no longer be part of the discourse.”

Attacks on Smith escalated after she suggested during a live 10 O’Clock News broadcast in May 2020 that Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, “enjoyed” being able to distinguish herself in combating the Covid pandemic. Sturgeon furiously denied that on Twitter, and said she found the Covid crisis stressful and unpleasant; Smith said her choice of words was a mistake.

She also wrongly reported that Alex Salmond had called on Sturgeon to resign over the mishandling of an official sexual misconduct investigation against him, and retracted that on Twitter.

Evans said Peter Smith, ITV News’s Scotland correspondent, and Ciaran Jenkins, who covers Scotland for Channel 4 News, were also regularly abused on social media for alleged bias, which appeared at times to be coordinated. “Absolutely horrendous” abuse came from unionists, Peter Smith said, but the majority was from independence supporters.

There have been a series of incidents in which BBC journalists have been abused or attacked. Three men were charged after Nick Watt, Newsnight’s political editor, was chased in the street by anti-lockdown protesters in June 2021.

A BBC spokesperson said: “The safety of our journalists is paramount and while we wouldn’t comment on individual cases, we have a range of measures in place to support our staff, both online and in person.

“No journalist should have to put up with the kind of abuse described by Sarah. There should be no place for it in journalism or any other aspect of public life.”","Sarah Smith, the BBC’s former Scotland editor, has said she feels relieved to have left the country after enduring years of misogynistic “bile and hatred” while covering Scottish politics.

This study will be a parallel randomized clinical trial (CRT) that will be conducted in Tehran, Iran, in 2021. The sample size was calculated by considering the type 1 error of 5%, the study power of 80% and the hepatic steatosis levels [30] (based on CAP) as a key variable based on data from previous studies. Considering the mean difference in hepatic steatosis levels of 2 dB/mL between the two groups [12], using the suggested formula for parallel clinical trials, we will need 28 patients in each group. However, by taking a possible drop-out of 20% into account, we will recruit 34 patients in each group based on the study inclusion criteria. Outpatients with NAFLD will be recruited from private clinics in Tehran, Iran. The diagnosis of NAFLD will be done by a gastroenterologist based on examination with a fiberoscan. The study is ethically approved by the Bioethics Committee of Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran, and is registered in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials website (http://www.irct.ir).

Inclusion criteria

In this study, we will recruit patients with NAFLD, whom condition was approved by a gastroenterologist using fiberoscan examination. Individuals aged 20–60 years with a body mass index between 25 to 35 kg/m2 that have a fixed plan for medication use during the last 3 months will be included in the current study.

Non-inclusion criteria

We will not include smokers, those with a history of alcohol use, pregnant or lactating women or those planning to get pregnant in the next three months, individuals with pathologic conditions affecting the liver, including acute and chronic hepatitis, viral hepatitis, liver transplantation, autonomic hepatitis, hemochromatosis, primary biliary cirrhosis or Wilson's disease, antitrypsin deficiency, thyroid disease and lactose intolerance. In addition, patients who were taking antibiotics and medications affecting serum lipids as well as those taking multivitamin-minerals during the previous month will not be included. Use of any probiotic products during the last two months will be another non-inclusion criteria.

Exclusion criteria

We will exclude patients who are on a specific diet throughout the study, those who are consuming alcohol and/or tobacco as well as individuals who are taking multivitamin-minerals throughout the study. In addition, any changes in the medications during the study will also be a criterion for exclusion.

Study design and intervention

A flowchart of the study design is shown Fig. 1. Flow-diagram of study process is shown in Fig. 2. In the first phase of this study, we will screen 300 patients with NAFLD based on the inclusion criteria mentioned above. Then, those who meet the criteria will be included in the study. All participants will be asked to complete and sign the written informed consent. Before the start of intervention, all study participants will be in a 2-week run-in period, during which four 24-h food recalls (two working days and one non-working day) will be used to collect dietary information. In addition, subjects will be requested to record their physical activity for two days (one working day and one weekend day) during this period. Further information about demographic characteristics, past medical history, medication use as well as socioeconomic status (SES) will be collected in this period through the use of a comprehensive questionnaire in a face-to-face interview. Anthropometric indices, blood pressure, liver enzymes, insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, liver fibrosis and lipid profile will be evaluated at study baseline. Then study participants will be classified into blocks based on age (20–40/ 40–60 years old), sex (male, female) and BMI (25–30/ 30-35 kg/m2). Therefore, the size of each block will be 2 people with the same age, sex and BMI. These participants will then be randomly assigned into intervention and non-intervention groups. Randomization will be done by a third person, who is not aware of the study aims and groups. The first person (say A) in a block will be assigned into the intervention group and the second person (say B) in that block will be assigned into the control group. All participants, study personals and laboratory staffs will be blind to the intervention. Participants in the intervention group will consume 300 g/d of probiotic yogurt containing 106 cfu/g of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium lactis strains for 12 weeks, while participants in the control group will consume 300 g/d of plain yogurt daily (without any added probiotics) for 12 weeks. Yogurt packages will be distributed to participants every two weeks. The appearance, packaging and taste of yogurts will be the same. Quality control of these yogurts in terms of colony forming units of live bacteria and other nutritional values will be evaluated before the study. In order to comply with the ethical requirements in research, all patients will receive a weight loss diet after ending the study. Participants will be asked not to change their routine lifestyle, dietary habits, and medicines throughout the study. All study outcomes will be examined again at the study end. The study was designed according to the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) 2013 shown in Fig. 3.

Adherence

Individuals will be asked to record their daily intake of probiotic or conventional yogurt in a checklist given them by researchers. To increase compliance and prevent forgetting about daily consumption of probiotic or conventional yogurt, participants will receive short messages on their cell phones every day as a reminder. In addition, each time yogurt packages are delivered, patients will be requested to return empty packages of consumed ones. To ensure the consumption of yogurts by the study participants, and not their family members, additional packages of conventional yogurts will be given to them for probable family members’ use.

Outcomes

The outcomes of the present clinical trial would be assessment of steatosis, fibrosis, serum liver enzyme levels including aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT). Systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), lipid profiles including high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (TC), serum triglycerides (TG) fasting blood sugar (FBS), fasting insulin and glucose hemostasis will also be considered. Weight and BMI will also be assessed. All these measurements will be assessed at study baseline and the end of trial.

Dietary intake and physical activity assessment

In order to ensure lack of change in dietary intakes of participants during the study, we will collect dietary intake data through the use of a 24-h dietary recall every three weeks throughout the study. These dietary recalls will be distributed through the week days to cover two working days and two weekends. Due to COVID-19 pandemic, dietary recalls will be completed through phone calls, not by face-to-face method. In these phone calls, participants will be asked to report their dietary intakes in a preceding day based on household measures. All reported foods in these recalls will then be converted to grams using available booklets. The average intake based on four dietary recalls will be considered in the analysis.

Participants will be asked not to change their physical activity during the trial. To make sure about this, we will request study subjects to record their physical activity in four separate days throughout the study including two working days and two weekends. All participants will be instructed how to record the type, intensity and time spent in each activity in a certain form that will be given to them at the study baseline. In order to process the physical activity records, we will use earlier published guidelines about MET-h/day values for each type of physical activity, in which we will consider the time spent for a certain physical activity by each participant. All records would be reviewed immediately to find possible errors and the problems will be resolved by interview.

Assessment of hepatic steatosis and fibrosis

Hepatic steatosis and fibrosis among all participants will be examined by transient elastography with fibroscan by the same gastroenterologist at the beginning and end of the study. Patients will be asked to lie down on their back and place the right hand above their head. Then the probe will be placed on the right side of the liver in patients’ intercostal area. The results of liver fibrosis will be expressed as Kilopascal (Kpa). The interpretation of fibrosis assessment results will be based on METAVIR Score [31]. The controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) test will be used to assess steatosis and the results will be reported in dB/m. CAP results will vary between 100 and 400 dB/m.

Biochemical assessment

To assess the level of liver enzymes (ALT, AST, GGT), blood sugar and lipid profiles (including total cholesterol, serum triglyceride and HDL cholesterol), 10 cc of intravenous blood samples will be collected after 10–12 h of fasting. Blood samples are centrifuged for 10 min at 2606.8 G and 4 °C to separate serum samples. The level of ALT and AST enzymes will be determined by photometry (Pars Azmoun) proposed by the IFCC (International Federation of Clinical Chemistry) method. GGT levels will also be assessed using the calorimetric-kinetic method proposed by the IFCC. Fasting blood glucose (FBS) levels will be measured by glucose oxidase and fasting insulin levels will be measured by ELISA method. Serum concentrations of total cholesterol and triglycerides will be measured by laboratory methods using enzymes such as cholesterol esterase, cholesterol oxidase and glycerol phosphate oxidase, respectively, using standard kits. HDL-C will be measured after deposition of apolipoprotein-B, which contains lipoproteins with phosphotungstic acid. LDL-C will be calculated from the values of TC, TG, HDL_C by the formula of Friedwald [32].

Glucose homeostasis assessment

Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA) and Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index (QUICKI) will be calculated based on suggested formulas [33, 34]

Blood pressure assessment

Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) will be measured after 5 min of rest with a mercury sphygmomanometer from the patient's right hand while sitting. Patients should not drink, exercise or smoke for one hour prior to blood pressure assessment. They must also have an empty bladder before measuring their blood pressure. Blood pressure will be taken twice, 5 min apart, while the patient is at rest. Systolic blood pressure is equivalent to the pressure measured after hearing the first korotkoff sound, and diastolic blood pressure is equivalent to the pressure measured when the korotkoff sound disappears. The mean of the two measurements will be considered as systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

Anthropometric assessments

To assess height, the person must be standing and barefoot with an accuracy of 0.5 cm. Weight will be measured using a digital scale with a minimum of clothing and barefoot with an accuracy of 100 gr. Waist circumference will be measured using a tape measure in the middle of the distance between the super iliac bone and the last rib with an accuracy of 0.5 cm. BMI will also be obtained by dividing weight in kilograms by height squared in meters [35].

Other variables assessments

A general questionnaire will be used to collect information about participants’ age, sex, marital status (single /married), education (yes/no), supplement use (yes/ no), medical history, tobacco use (non-smoker /smoking history/smoker), occupation, history of drug use.

Statistical analysis

In this study, all analyses will be done using SPSS software version 26. Normal distribution of data will be assessed by the application of Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. In case of a non-normal distribution, we will apply logarithmic transformation. Results will be reported as mean ± standard deviations (SD) or medians (interquartile ranges). General characteristics and dietary intake of individuals between the two groups will be compared using independent t-test and chi-square test as needed. Repeated measure analysis of variance (RM-ANOVA) will be used to examine the effects of probiotic yogurt consumption on outcome variables, where we will examine the effects of time, intervention as well as time-group interaction effects. In this analysis, baseline values of outcome variables will be controlled for. We will also perform post hoc tests after ANOVA analysis to examine the variables between study groups. In case of any difference between the two groups in terms of dietary intakes (other than the intervention) and physical activity throughout the study, these differences will be adjusted for in the analysis to reach an independent effect of intervention on study outcomes. Statistical significance will be set to 0.05.

Ethics and dissemination

This clinical trial study was confirmed by the ethics committee of Tehran University of Medical Sciences (code: IR.TUMS.MEDICINE.REC.1399.1006). Furthermore, it was registered in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (www.irct.ir) at 2021-04-19 (code: IRCT20210201050210N1).

Singapore, 11 January 2022 – From April 2022, medical and nursing students at NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine will be using three-dimensional holographic technology from Microsoft to help them learn certain medical procedures and study anatomical structures.

The collaboration, which spans NUS Medicine, the National University Health System and Microsoft adds mixed reality to the learning experience; named Project Polaris. Through holographic technology, medical and nursing undergraduates can expect to better hone their skills through training enabled by the Microsoft HoloLens 2. This progressive use of mixed reality in healthcare education stems from Microsoft’s work with the National University Health System, which is embarking on Holomedicine research in Singapore with the aim to enhance patient care.

In Project Polaris, the HoloLens 2 will be used to project three-dimensional holograms to give medical and nursing students a visual appreciation of actual clinical scenarios in practice. The suite of instructional software developed by the team from NUS Medicine and Microsoft Industry Solutions provides 3D, mixed reality technology which will be used to help students practice clinical procedural skills such as inserting a cannula, as well as inserting catheters in male and female urinary tracts.

Project Polaris comes with three levels of difficulty, with a goal to train and provide sufficient direction to allow students at varying levels of competence to achieve the highest standards of clinical practice in a safe space, said the School’s Assistant Dean for Education and co-project lead, Associate Professor Alfred Kow. “We are truly excited to see how far this collaboration with Microsoft can go in terms of offering our students innovative and effective visual aids and teaching mechanisms. With the ongoing pandemic, virtual reality and mixed reality has been identified as a must-have tool for teaching and learning at onsite and remote environments.”

Polaris is part of a larger programme called Project Horizon, which consists of more initiatives like Project Delphinus and Project Mira. These aim to train students in clinical soft skills and clinical anatomy respectively, positioning NUS Medicine as the first in Southeast Asia to introduce holographic mixed reality as a teaching tool to train medical and nursing students.

The medical and technical expertise of NUS Medicine and Microsoft will pave the way for the development of a niche technological competency, in which clinical training tools can be developed to introduce realistic clinical scenarios for use in medical education.

“We are continually pursuing new and innovative teaching methods to help medical and nursing students better understand the medical curriculum and gain a new appreciation for healthcare and health, while striving to maintain a balance with time-tested traditional approaches,” said Associate Professor Lau Tang Ching, the School’s Vice-Dean for Education. “This incorporation of holographic mixed-reality learning fits in well with our teaching initiatives and we hope to see this collaboration with Microsoft flourish in the coming years.”

“From delivering better healthcare experiences at the frontlines to helping neurosurgeons keep patients better informed of what could happen during their surgeries, technology has been an empowering tool for healthcare workers as they protect and save the lives of patients. As one of the few hospitals in Southeast Asia that has a tertiary education arm which collaborates with a training hospital, NUS Medicine is in a unique position to use mixed reality solutions and the Microsoft HoloLens 2 to aid in the transformation of healthcare education, for years to come,” said Richard Koh, National Technology Officer, Microsoft Singapore.

Professor Chong Yap Seng, Dean of NUS Medicine, said he looked forward to the impact that technology would bring to medical education, “I’m glad to see that our educators have found like-minded industry partners to work with in educating the next generation of medical professionals. With such interdisciplinary partnerships, we are even more confident that our graduates will be future-ready clinicians.”

Mullins underwent intestinal surgery in November 2020 after a diagnosis of Crohn's disease. He was diagnosed during the season and waited until it ended before having the surgery.

""It was a shock for me to have to go through that,"" Mullins said. ""My main concern was being ready for the season and not missing any time, and luckily I was able to do that and build my body back up through the season.""

In 2021, Mullins became the first player in Orioles history to hit 30 home runs and steal 30 bases in the same season. He was also the starting center fielder for the American League in the All-Star Game and hit .291 batting left-handed exclusively after abandoning switch-hitting.

Mullins shared the news of his Crohn's diagnosis with Baltimore's front office and a few close friends, including first baseman/designated hitter Trey Mancini, who had missed the 2020 season after undergoing colon cancer surgery and chemotherapy.

Mancini's recovery was the big story in Orioles' camp last year, and Mullins chose not to reveal his illness to allow Mancini to share his story.

""My situation wasn't life or death,"" Mullins said. ""It was something I knew I was going to be able to come back from, and Trey was coming back from his chemotherapy, and for me, all the support needed to go to him. For him to do what he did, come back and play a full season, regardless of how he tired he was. He showed up every single day and performed really well. I thought it was important for him to get that recognition.

""His accomplishment certainly outweighs mine.""

Mullins texted Mancini to tell him of his surgery and ask for his advice.

""The surgery was very similar, and he asked about coming back, and what did I do to ramp up?"" Mancini said. ""Obviously, it was a little bit of a different situation because I had chemo following my surgery. You need to take a lot of time after that.

""That's a huge shock to the body. I told him you have a lot of time to catch up. Don't rush into anything. You've got a lot of time to get back and be yourself. You saw what he did. He did just fine. I think he ramped up the proper amount, and he handled it incredibly well, I think.""

During the shortened 2020 season, Mullins played regularly for the first time, but his symptoms bothered him.

""I'd have occasional cramping,"" Mullins said. ""In terms of full-blown pain, I didn't really hit that mark.""

During the surgery, which he detailed in a February video, 10 to 15 centimeters of intestine were removed. He lost 20 pounds. Once he rehabilitated, Mullins felt several positive reactions.

Although heart disease is one of the primary causes of death, it is not unavoidable. While some risk factors, such as family history, sex, or age, cannot be controlled, there are numerous strategies to lower your risk of heart disease. Elderly adults are more susceptible to heart disease, but in recent years we have seen an increase in heart attack and cardiac arrest cases among children and teenagers. In India, people under the age of 25 are increasingly at risk of type-2 diabetes and life-threatening complications like heart diseases.

According to recent studies by the WHO, heart disease is one of the major causes of deaths globally (approximately 32% of all deaths globally in 2019). For most of us, preventing heart disease depends largely on our lifestyle - physical inertia, poor sleep hygiene and poor emotional hygiene are critical factors to look after - which means there's much that's in our power to improve our odds of living long and well.

Family History: An underlying cause

Family history is one of the several known risk factors for cardiovascular disease. It has an underlying genetic factor as a cause. Different types of heart diseases and related conditions, like high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol, can run in families. Knowing your family history of heart disease and related conditions is one of the first steps you can take to prevent heart disease and heart attack.

Sedentary behavior and physical inactivity are among the leading modifiable risk factors worldwide for cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality. Poor sleep patterns, diabetes and obesity are among the major contributors to cardiovascular disease as well. Making tiny changes to your day-to-day activities can result in major health benefits. Walk at least 10,000 steps a day and avoid using elevators wherever possible. Sitting long hours (over six) without physical activity can cause you as much harm as a pack of cigarettes.

Another important parameter to a healthy heart is sleep hygiene. Disturbed sleep can trigger hormones that can make you prone to high blood sugar, high blood pressure, and heart attacks. Keep a track of your sleep cycle. Rate it every morning on a scale from one to ten, ten being ideal. Assess the quality of your sleep based on whether you have to be woken up in the morning or if you dream during your sleep. Further, limit exposure to any digital screens 30 minutes before sleep time, choose nutritious food over unhealthy food, read nutrition labels before picking up items from supermarket shelves such simple lifestyle changes will help you stay motivated to take on bigger habitual changes for the betterment of your health.

Most people know that cigarette and tobacco smoking increase the danger of carcinoma and breathing problems, but few realize that it also greatly increases the danger of developing heart conditions, peripheral vascular disease (a disease in the vessels that supply blood to the arms and legs), and abdominal aortic aneurysms. Putting an end to smoking reduces the risk for heart disease, the risk for repeat heart attacks, and death by heart disease by half. Quitting smoking is a key and it is the most important thing you can do to lower your chances of a heart attack or stroke.

Cholesterol and heart disease: Is there a connection?

Cholesterol is often displayed in poor light because of its association with heart disease. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol is referred to as ‘good' cholesterol because it aids in the removal of other types of cholesterol from the bloodstream. Higher HDL cholesterol levels are linked to a lower risk of heart disease. It is critical to have a standard diet that can be followed for the rest of one's life to live a healthy and disease-free life. Adults can minimize their risk of heart disease by following healthy eating habits that are low in dietary cholesterol. These high-cholesterol foods, as well as processed and fast foods, can contribute to obesity and weight gain. Obesity and being overweight or obese increase your risk of heart disease and other health problems.

Conclusion

Heart diseases can affect men and women equally and claim lots of lives every year. By making some healthy lifestyle choices, you can improve your heart health. Living post a heart attack or trying to prevent it requires change. Instead of munching on junk foods, people should look for healthy alternatives like fruits, fresh juices, whole grains, lean meats, nuts, seeds and legumes. It is also important to avoid trans-fatty acids and include plenty of fresh, green vegetables in the diet rich in minerals and calcium. It is also vital that proper attention is paid to the time of the meals. Small changes to your diet and exercise routines can really pay off when it comes to your heart health. You may find that the change is not so difficult once you start.

These diseases are complex and possess a significant challenge both in terms of diagnosis and management. The field of rare diseases is constantly evolving.

A plethora of rare conditions are constantly being added to the already existing pool of rare complications. Due to this, clinicians and researchers across the globe are working tirelessly to create better management and therapeutic approaches for the patients.

Rare Disease (Looking Deeper)

Compared to the innumerable number of patients affected by prevalent diseases like diabetes, heart diseases, etc., a rare disease has a limited number of patients. So far, about 5000-8000 unique, rare diseases have been described. Rare diseases affect approximately 400 to 700 million individuals globally, making them a global healthcare issue.

An RD affects around 60 million individuals in the United States and the European Union. The number of RDs is currently estimated to be in the thousands. These conditions are frequently significant, harm one's quality of life, and can even be fatal. Most RDs have a genetic component, with 72–80 % of these disorders having a gene or genes identified.

They are usually defined by their low frequency, measured in terms of prevalence or incidence within a country or geographical region. In the medical literature, five novels RDs are characterized on average every week. According to a global study of RD terminology, 58% of definitions contained a prevalence criterion, with a global average of 40 cases per 100,000 persons.

According to the European Medicines Agency or EMA, rare diseases can be described as a medical condition with a prevalence of fewer than 5 patients in 10,000 people. The research and clinical development surrounding rare diseases are escalating at a positive rate. However, there is a lot more to explore and understand.

The Various Challenges

RDs encompass a wide range of disorders and clinical manifestations, however, the vast majority of RDs afflict children and are chronic and life-threatening. The majority of rare diseases aren't curable, with only a few having efficient available therapies. The recognition and diagnosis of RDs present several interrelated issues. They significantly impact the quality of epidemiologic and clinical investigations and complicate the definition of unmet patient requirements, safety, possible efficacy, effectiveness, and value of RD treatments.

Inadequate awareness and knowledge of RDs can lead to misdiagnosis and a delay in receiving a definitive diagnosis. Patients who are unfamiliar with relevant signs and symptoms may fail to seek medical help when necessary. Similarly, professionals may misdiagnose the disease or mistake symptoms for those of more frequent diseases with which they are more familiar. The comparability of data from epidemiologic and clinical investigations may be significantly limited if we don't fully grasp the disease and its cause.

Heterogeneity in pathogenesis, presentation of signs and symptoms, disease severity, and development might make it difficult to characterize a rare disease in clinical research and detect it in ordinary clinical practice, leading to misdiagnosis and underestimating of genuine disease frequency.

In patients with pathognomic clinical characteristics, diagnosing an RD may be simple. Diagnostic certainty, on the other hand, might be a challenge due to the variety of many RDs and the difficulty in correctly interpreting sophisticated investigative testing methods.

Misdiagnoses are widespread as a result of the aforementioned issues, which can lead to ineffective therapy. Such medication may not only cause adverse effects, but it may also hide signs of the underlying problem, delaying the accurate diagnosis and beginning of suitable treatment even longer. An RD's occurrence varies by geography and country, ranging from dense clustering in certain areas to vast distribution in others. In the situation of prevalence heterogeneity, prevalence statistics from epidemiologic studies undertaken in a specific region may be incorrectly extrapolated to larger geography.

Overcoming the hurdles

Rare disease research has received a great deal of attention in recent decades. It is primarily due to legislation designed to make it easier for patients to have access to effective treatments by rewarding pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to develop novel medications that would otherwise be unprofitable. In the field of rare diseases, there has also been a remarkable increase in social awareness and worldwide connectedness. Several groups are forming to provide information to the general public and to educate them about uncommon diseases.

As a result, governments all over the world have realized the importance of enacting laws and regulations to encourage the development of new and novel technology for the treatment of RDs. The detection of RDs has improved due to advancements in molecular genetics, disease pathophysiology, and medical technology. They've also aided researchers in figuring out how to improve the diagnosis, prognosis, treatment for rare diseases and precisely subclassify common diseases into groups of RDs with different characteristics.

Patient Registries for Rare Diseases: A Goldmine

Patient registries are a valuable instrument in the field of rare diseases (RD) that aids clinical research, promotes the development of appropriate clinical trials, improves patient care, and supports healthcare administration. They create a critical information infrastructure that supports the work of European Reference Networks (ERNs) on rare diseases.

There has been a significant expansion of RD registries in recent years, necessitating the development of guidance for the basic requirements, recommendations, and standards required to maintain a high-quality registry. Several such registries have been formed in recent years including, the Registry for Neuromuscular Disease, Central Registry of Rare Diseases (CRRD), Ataxia-Telangiectasia International Registry, EHDN: registry of juvenile Huntington's disease, and EUROCARE CF: European cystic fibrosis registry.

The Rare Diseases Registry Program (RaDaR) website was developed in 2021 by NCATS to give the rare disease community free and easily available instructions on how to set up and manage high-quality registries. RaDaR will be a dynamic website. In a staged approach, NCATS staff will continue to add new instructions, best practices, testimonials, and other resources from the rare disease community to the site. Although the researchers exploring the area of rare diseases have achieved significantly, we still have a long road ahead of us.

TOKYO — As pandemic-led isolation triggers an epidemic of loneliness, Japanese are increasingly turning to ""social robots"" for solace and mental healing.

At the city's Penguin Cafe, proud owners of the electronic dog Aibo gathered recently with their cyber-pups in Snuglis and fancy carryalls. From camera-embedded snouts to their sensor-packed paws, these high-tech hounds are nothing less than members of the family, despite a price tag of close to $3,000 — mandatory cloud plan not included.

It's no wonder Aibo has pawed its way into hearts and minds. Re-launched in 2017, Aibo's artificial intelligence-driven personality is minutely shaped by the whims and habits of its owner, building the kind of intense emotional attachments usually associated with kids, or beloved pets.

Noriko Yamada rushed to order one, when her mother-in-law began showing signs of dementia several years ago. ""Mother had stopped smiling and talking,"" she told CBS News. ""But when we switched the dog on, and it gazed up at her, she just lit up. Her behavior changed 180 degrees.""

And a few months ago, when the mother-in-law was hospitalized for heart disease, Koro the robot again came to the rescue. ""Because of COVID, we couldn't visit her. The nurse said Mother was responding to pictures of Koro, and asked us to bring in the dog. So, Koro was the last person in our family to see Mother alive.""

Robots as companions are an easier leap for Japanese, many manufacturers and users say, because the country is steeped in friendly androids, like the long-running TV cartoon ""Doraemon,"" in which a cute, roly-poly pal provides not only constant company, but an endless supply of useful tricks.

But one robot startup is proving looks aren't everything. Despite having neither head, arms nor legs, the Qoobo bot sold more than 30,000 units by September, many to stressed-out users working from home under COVID restrictions. The retail price starts at about $200.

Yukai Engineering CEO Shunsuke Aoki told CBS News that Qoobo leverages the most pleasing parts of a pet — a fluffy torso, and a wagging tail. ""At first, it seemed weird,"" he said. ""But when you pet an animal like a cat, you usually don't bother to look at its face.""

Frazzled adults aren't the only Japanese turning to robots. At Moriyama Kindergarten in the central Japanese city of Nagoya, robots are replacing the traditional class guinea pig or bunny. Teachers told CBS News that the bots reduce anxiety and teach kids to be more humane.

Two years ago, the preschool bought a pair of Lovot brand bots named Rice Cake and Cocoa. Weighing as much as an infant, with the price tag of a French bulldog, the cybernetic machines are designed to love-bomb their owners -- or, in this case, a roomful of fidgety five-year-olds.

""Our kids think the robots are alive,"" said principal Kyoshin Kodama. ""The bots have encouraged the kids to take better care of things, be kinder to each other, and cooperate more.""

Lovot is a so-called ""emotional robot"" programmed to autonomously navigate its surroundings, remember its owners and respond to hugs and other affection, gazing out with its oversized, quivering, high-resolution eyes. Over the last year sales have jumped 11-fold.

""Their body temperature is set to 98.6 degrees,"" Groove X company spokesperson Miki Ikegami told CBS News. ""Robots are usually hard, cold and inhuman. But since our bots are built to soothe, we made them warm and soft.""

Japan's oldest and most successful social robot is an FDA-approved device called Paro.

Resembling an ordinary plush toy, the artificial intelligence-powered bot customizes its response as it gets to ""know"" each patient. Inventor Takanori Shibata, based at Japan's National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, told CBS News that clinical trials have backed the device's benefits as a non-drug therapy. ""Interaction with Paro can improve depression, anxiety, pain and also improve the mood of the person.""

Since launching in 1998, thousands of Paro robots have gone into service, worldwide, relieving stress among children in ICUs, treating U.S. veterans suffering from PTSD, and helping dementia patients.

Like real flesh-and-blood pets, Paro has been shown to stimulate brain activity, helping reconnect damaged areas. ""One lady didn't speak for more than ten years,"" Shibata said. ""When she interacted with Paro, she started to talk to Paro and she recovered her speech and she spoke to others.""

Neuroscientist Julie Robillard, who studies social robots for children and seniors, told CBS News that robotics experts are trying to tease out the exact nature of the human-robot relationship — and the notion of machines as friends is not as farfetched as it might seem.

""We can be attached to various types of devices and objects,"" said Robillard, an assistant professor of neurology at the University of British Columbia. ""Some people have given names to their robot vacuums … Some people feel strongly about their cars or about their wedding bands.""

Evidence supports the use of social robots, she said, in areas like imparting social skills to children with autism, or teaching exercises to rehab patients – offering instruction without judgment.

But in other areas, it's unclear how well social robots really work, she said. ""What we can say from the science right now is that robots have a huge amount of potential.""

And discovering that potential is all the more urgent now, in the covid era, as robots offer the promise of social connection without social contact.

Creators say intelligent social robots will never replace humans. But when companions, caregivers or therapists aren't available, robots are lending a friendly paw – and are already earning their keep.","""Mother had stopped smiling and talking,"" she told CBS News.

There is no better time to rethink and rework the rare disease eco-system – and to do this in partnership. The need is evident. For the 5% of rare diseases with at least one authorised treatment, the standard of care for many patients can still be improved. And it’s vital to continue the search for treatments for the remaining 95% of rare diseases, and overcoming the challenge that more than 80% of rare diseases have a prevalence of less than 1 in 100,000. Diagnosis is often late and patients face a bewildering odyssey through healthcare systems that often starts early in childhood.

Plasma-derived therapies, for instance, are critical life-saving and life-sustaining medicines that are often the only treatment option for people with rare and complex chronic diseases, like immunodeficiency diseases. They can only be made from human plasma. Agreement is needed urgently on how to increase plasma donation in Europe to meet growing demand for these medicines - otherwise, more patients lives may be at risk.

Takeda and the private sector are ready to partner to bring treatments and solutions for persons living with a rare disease into a new era

Today, we must address issues relating to the entire cycle of drug development for tackling rare diseases. Europe faces challenges in basic research, diagnostic capacity, infrastructure, consensus on regulatory and market access evidence, uptake of innovation, equitable access to treatment, and security of supply. Incentives for more innovation in rare diseases might come from evolving the current EU regulation on orphan drugs to create more incentives for under-invested disease areas, while recalibrating rewards where progress in standard of care will not be impacted.

A Takeda-commissioned study identified practical potential mechanisms to unlock wider acceptance of new medicines across Europe, such as a public-private partnership for basic research funding that captures the patient perspective, an early evidence partnership to increase predictability among developers, regulators and payers, or value-based risk-sharing contracts, where appropriate. These partnerships would promote a more comprehensive and effective vision of European intent, that recognises that science is not linear, that shares the data that feeds research, permits diagnosis, and translates innovation into treatments for patients.

It’s encouraging to see more unity and closer collaboration through Rare 2030 and a European Action Plan for Rare Diseases, and we’re looking forward to achieving tangible results in the near future. The pandemic has unveiled innovative new ways of working and has created unexpected but valuable alliances that we can build on. Takeda and the private sector are ready to partner to bring treatments and solutions for persons living with a rare disease into a new era.

502,502,https://www.straitstimes.com/tech/st-explains-telegram-popularity-perils-and-precautions,ST Explains: Why is Telegram so popular and what can be done about its problems?,"SINGAPORE - Messaging app Telegram has been in the news recently for all the wrong reasons - such as for being linked to crime, misinformation and abuse.

The app has also made waves overseas, with Germany considering a ban on it due to an influx of extremist content, including anti-vaccine conspiracy theories that have led to threats of violence.

But what is it that has made the app so popular - it now has more than 500 million users - and a hotbed for scams? What can be done about its problems? The Straits Times explains.

1. Mega chat group size a draw

Mr Bryan Tan, a lawyer from Pinsent Masons MPillay who specialises in technology law, attributes Telegram's popularity to its large chat size that can go up to 200,000 users - compared with WhatsApp's 256-user limit.

""This allows Telegram to be used for mega-sized groups, almost like a news site, without having to run expensive content servers,"" he said, adding that the app also allows users to send large files.

2. Phone number not needed for account registration

It is optional to provide a phone number when registering a Telegram account.

""Anonymity plays a large role in the spread of misinformation, because there is no mechanism of accountability,"" said Associate Professor Edson C. Tandoc Jr from Nanyang Technological University (NTU).

Prof Tandoc, who is from NTU's Centre for Information Integrity and the Internet, added: ""Take, for example, anti-vaccination groups, where people share information that may not be backed by evidence. Just the volume of messages that come in every day can make it convincing for some people.""

But a larger issue arising from the growing use of Telegram and the anonymity it affords is the formation of extremist groups, said experts.

Ms Tania Chin, a partner in the criminal litigation team at law firm Withers KhattarWong, said: ""Coordination of terror attacks, espousing terrorist ideals and the spread of disinformation are still the greatest threats.""

3. Lack of default end-to-end encryption

Dr Natalie Pang, senior lecturer and deputy head of the Communications and New Media Department at the National University of Singapore, said end-to-end encryption is not provided by default on Telegram as it is with other apps such as WhatsApp.

The encryption ensures that only the two users communicating can access the information shared on the chat.

""In other words, chats in Telegram can still run the risk of being leaked and accessed by third parties,"" Dr Pang said.

This means hackers can use Telegram to spread malware or ransomware to steal or lock up users' data.","SINGAPORE - Messaging app Telegram has been in the news recently for all the wrong reasons - such as for being linked to crime, misinformation and abuse.

503,503,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/self-isolation-for-those-with-covid-19-can-end-after-five-full-days-following-two-negative-lfd-tests,[Withdrawn] Self-isolation for those with COVID-19 can end after 5 full days following 2 negative LFD tests,"People self-isolating with COVID-19 will have the option to reduce their isolation period after 5 full days if they test negative on both day 5 and day 6 and do not have a temperature, from Monday, 17 January

Individuals who are still positive on their rapid lateral flow tests must stay in isolation until they have had 2 consecutive negative tests taken on separate days

This will support essential public services and keep supply chains running over the winter

From Monday 17 January, people with COVID-19 in England can end their self-isolation after 5 full days, as long as they test negative on day 5 and day 6.

The decision has been made after careful consideration of modelling from the UK Health Security Agency and to support essential public services and workforces over the winter.

It is crucial that people isolating with COVID-19 wait until they have received 2 negative rapid lateral flow tests on 2 consecutive days to reduce the chance of still being infectious.

The first test must be taken no earlier than day 5 of the self-isolation period, and the second must be taken the following day. If an individual is positive on day 5, then a negative test is required on day 6 and day 7 to release from isolation.

It is essential that 2 negative rapid lateral flow tests are taken on consecutive days and reported before individuals return to their job or education, if leaving self-isolation earlier than the full 10-day period.

For instance, if an individual is positive on day 5, then a negative test is required on both day 6 and day 7 to release from self-isolation, or positive on day 6, then a negative test is required on days 7 and 8, and so on until the end of day 10.

Those who leave self-isolation on or after day 6 are strongly advised to wear face coverings and limit close contact with other people in crowded or poorly ventilated spaces, work from home if they can do so and minimise contact with anyone who is at higher risk of severe illness if infected with COVID-19.

The default self-isolation period continues to be 10 days, and you may only leave self-isolation early if you have taken 2 rapid lateral flow tests and do not have a temperature in line with guidance.

Health and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid said:

After reviewing all of the evidence, we’ve made the decision to reduce the minimum self-isolation period to 5 full days in England. These 2 tests are critical to these balanced and proportionate plans and I’d urge everyone to take advantage of the capacity we’ve built up in tests so we can restore more freedom to this country, whilst we are keeping everyone safe.

Existing public health measures remain in place, including:

staying at home if you feel unwell

getting a test if you experience any COVID-19 symptoms

wearing a face covering in crowded, enclosed spaces

working from home if possible

maintaining social distancing and regular hand washing

taking up the offer of the free COVID-19 vaccine

Self-isolation may continue in certain circumstances, such as for those who work with vulnerable people. A full list will be published in guidance in due course.

Vaccinations remain our best defence against COVID-19, offering substantial protection against infection and hospitalisation – and the government continues to urge the public to get boosted as soon as you’re eligible.

In line with today’s announcement, the government will also consider the guidance for close contacts of people with COVID-19, including around the advice for fully vaccinated contacts to take daily rapid lateral flow tests for 7 days.

Background

Under the current testing rules, around 6% of people will be infectious when they are released from isolation on day 7 following 2 consecutive negative rapid lateral flow tests.

Once the guidance is changed to end isolation on day 6 with 2 consecutive negative rapid lateral flow results, modelling from the UK Health Security Agency shows this figure will rise to around 7%.

If you leave isolation on day 6, after 5 full days of isolation, between 20% and 30% of people are still infectious.

The percentage of those released while infectious is reduced to around 7% if people have 2 consecutive negative tests and then leave isolation from day 6.

The self-isolation period was previously reduced from ending on day 10 to day 7, with a negative rapid lateral flow test result taken 24 hours apart on day 6 and 7 on 22 December 2021.

Individuals may only leave isolation once they have had 2 negative rapid lateral flow tests on 2 consecutive days; if they test positive on day 5, 6 or 7, they must continue testing until they have 2 negative tests.

If you test positive for COVID-19 you must self-isolate, it is the law. The law states that you must self-isolate for 10 days, however this change enables people who are not infectious, proven via 2 negative tests over 2 days, which can start from day 5, to leave isolation on day 6.

If individuals test positive during their isolation period it does not restart the clock for the 10-day isolation period. Day 0 of the isolation period is when you first show symptoms or, if asymptomatic, the day you took your test.

The rules for contacts have not changed. Fully vaccinated individuals who are identified as contacts of someone with COVID-19 should take daily rapid lateral flow tests for 7 days but are not legally required to self-isolate. Unvaccinated contacts are legally required to self-isolate for the full 10-day period.","It is crucial that people isolating with COVID-19 wait until they have received 2 negative rapid lateral flow tests on 2 consecutive days to reduce the chance of still being infectious.

Fatty Liver Disease Symptoms: 5 Signs Your Liver Is At Risk That Can Show Up On Face And Skin

Is your liver at risk? Look out for these signs and symptoms.

Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease, also known as NAFLD, is a metabolic disorder that leads to an unusual accumulation of fat inside the hepatic (liver) cells. According to the data, one in 3 adults in India is suffering from fatty liver disease. Experts have also warned that the numbers could go up in the upcoming days due to the lack of awareness and the increased rate of obesity in the country.

Speaking to TheHealthSite.com, a doctor said that non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is closely connected to the issue of insulin resistance in the body. This health trouble can also lead to type 2 diabetes, which if not managed well on time, can actually lead to severe health complications that can majorly affect the nervous, renal and cardiovascular systems. One of the most severe forms of fatty liver disease, called NASH causes liver inflammation and can progress to cirrhosis and hepatic failure.

Some of the other health issues that fatty liver disease can cause are sleep apnea, extreme fatigue, reduction in cognitive abilities, etc. Below mentioned are some of the contributing factors to NAFLD.

Obesity Type-2 diabetes Insulin resistance High blood pressure High cholesterol High triglyceride levels Stress

What Are The Symptoms of Fatty Liver Disease?

The condition can come with some telltale signs and symptoms. Here is a list of some of those signs that you should never ignore:

Abdominal pain Nausea Loss of appetite Unexplained weight loss. Yellowish skin and whites of the eyes Extreme fatigue Swollen abdomen and legs Weakness

Fatty Liver Disease Symptoms on Skin And Eyes

Yes, you read that right. Fatty liver disease symptoms can also show up on your face, and timely detection of these signs can help in staying protected against any type of health complications.

Signs of Fatty Liver on The Face

A sudden change inside the liver can cause serious issues inside the organ. Due to the underlying metabolic derangement, some patients suffering from fatty liver disease can show changes that can appear on their faces. These signs include -- Puffiness of the eyes and dark circles, wrinkling around the eyes and corners of the mouth, and yellow discolouration of the eyes (if jaundice is pronounced) are some of the symptoms of fatty liver.

Acne Could Be A Sign Too

Another symptom of fatty liver disease that can appear on the face is redness boils or acne. Some of the other unusual signs can include -- unexplained thinning of facial hair especially eyebrows, redness and flushing of the cheeks, facial swelling, and developing or worsening of existing acne.

Spider Veins Are Dangerous

When your liver is at risk, you can spit spider veins on your face. This is a sign that only severe liver damage patients can spot.

How To Keep The Liver Healthy

One must realise that proper detoxification, and diet are important in order to keep the liver healthy and happy. Some of the other tips to keep the liver safe from suffering complications are:

Follow a simple and less oily/spicy diet Drink a lot of fluid Avoid smoking Avoid consuming excessive alcohol Add more green to your diet Keep your weight under control Manage your blood pressure levels Exercise regularly","Fatty Liver Disease Symptoms: 5 Signs Your Liver Is At Risk That Can Show Up On Face And SkinFatty Liver Disease Symptoms: 5 Signs Your Liver Is At Risk That Can Show Up On Face And SkinIs your liver at risk?

Babesiosis, a disease caused by microscopic parasites that infect red blood cells first found 50 years ago in Nantucket, has now been confirmed to be endemic in all six New England states. Between 2011 and 2019, cases of babesiosis rose by 25% in Maine, Vermont and New Hampshire.

The disease was already considered endemic in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York and New Jersey, according to the CDC. It’s spread by black-legged ticks, which can send the parasites into the bloodstream of any organism it lands on, including people.

Babesiosis causes illness that could go from asymptomatic or mild to severe, or fatal among anyone immunocompromised. Symptoms include fever, muscle and joint pain and headache, with the possibility of severe complications like thrombocytopenia, renal failure, and respiratory distress syndrome occurring, the CDC said.

“Members of the public and health care providers in states with endemic babesiosis and bordering states should be aware of the clinical signs of babesiosis and risk factors for Babesia infection,” the survey read. “Persons spending time outdoors in states with endemic babesiosis should practice tick bite prevention, including wearing long pants, avoiding underbrush and long grass, and using tick repellents.”

Although the CDC doesn’t explain why there’s a rise in babesiosis cases, warmer winters give ticks a chance to thrive in below-freezing weather, according to Science in 2022, as “variable winter conditions brought on by climate change could increase ticks’ activity, boosting the odds that people will encounter the ticks...” Both Science and Connecticut Public Radio in January 2023 emphasized that a temperature bump of a few degrees will mean more tick-borne disease infections, including Lyme disease.

Compared with Lyme disease, which ticks are also known to transmit, cases of babesiosis are rare. The CDC reported that states logged over 1,800 cases of babesiosis per year between 2011 and 2019. Per year, 30,000 cases of Lyme disease are typically reported, according to the CDC.

However, they added that the actual number of cases is likely much higher given the disparity in reporting between the states. Across 37 states, 16,456 cases of babesiosis were reported to the CDC. The disease is not reported in Alaska, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oklahoma and Pennsylvania.","The disease was already considered endemic in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York and New Jersey, according to the CDC.

“The eye is the window into the brain,” said ophthalmologist Dr. Christine Greer, director of medical education at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Boca Raton, Florida. “You can see directly into the nervous system by looking into the back of the eye, toward the optic nerve and retina.”

Research has been exploring how the eye may help in diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease before symptoms begin. The disease is well advanced by the time memory and behavior are affected.

“Alzheimer’s disease begins in the brain decades before the first symptoms of memory loss,” said Dr. Richard Isaacson, an Alzheimer’s preventive neurologist who is also at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases.

If doctors are able to identify the disease in its earliest stages, people could then make healthy lifestyle choices and control their “modifiable risk factors, like high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes,” Isaacson said,

The eye knows

Just how early can we see signs of cognitive decline? To find out, a recent study examined donated tissue from the retina and brains of 86 people with different degrees of mental decline.

“Our study is the first to provide in-depth analyses of the protein profiles and the molecular, cellular, and structural effects of Alzheimer’s disease in the human retina and how they correspond with changes in the brain and cognitive function,” said senior author Maya Koronyo-Hamaoui, a professor of neurosurgery and biomedical sciences at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles, in a statement.

“These changes in the retina correlated with changes in parts of the brain called the entorhinal and temporal cortices, a hub for memory, navigation and the perception of time,” Koronyo-Hamaoui said.

Investigators in the study collected retinal and brain tissue samples over 14 years from 86 human donors with Alzheimer’s disease and mild cognitive impairment — the largest group of retinal samples ever studied, according to the authors.

Researchers then compared samples from donors with normal cognitive function to those with mild cognitive impairment and those with later-stage Alzheimer’s disease.

The study, published in February in the journal Acta Neuropathologica, found significant increases in beta-amyloid, a key marker of Alzheimer’s disease, in people with both Alzheimer’s and early cognitive decline.

Microglial cells declined by 80% in those with cognitive issues, the study found. These cells are responsible for repairing and maintaining other cells, including clearing beta-amyloid from the brain and retina.

“Markers of inflammation were (also) found, which may be an equally important marker for disease progression,” said Isaacson, who was not involved in the study.

“The findings were also apparent in people with no or minimal cognitive symptoms, which suggests these new eye tests may be well-positioned to aid in early diagnosis.”

Tissue atrophy and inflammation in cells in the far periphery of the retina were most predictive of cognitive status, the study found.

“These findings may eventually lead to the development of imaging techniques that allow us to diagnose Alzheimer’s disease earlier and more accurately,” Isaacson said, “and monitor its progression noninvasively by looking through the eye.”

Moreover, the work contributes to a growing field of research on ASOs, which are the basis of a new class of therapies that may be especially useful for treating thorny neurodegenerative diseases and other conditions that stem from genetic mutations, including certain types of cancer and epilepsy.

Building momentum

In recent years, scientists have become increasingly interested in the therapeutic potential of ASOs, which are short, single-strand sequences of synthetic DNA or RNA built in the lab.

The idea is that researchers design an ASO to correct specific protein deficiencies or malfunctions by binding to a particular stretch of RNA transcribed from the gene of interest.

This binding can cause the gene to be expressed at higher or lower levels, thus affecting the production of proteins linked to various physiologic functions.

Perhaps the most well-known ASO to date is a drug called nusinersen, which was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for spinal muscular atrophy in 2016.

Patients with spinal muscular atrophy have a mutation on both copies of their survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene, which causes reduced production of the associated survival motor neuron (SMN) protein.

SMN is the essential fuel for motor neurons in the brain stem and spinal cord that control voluntary muscle movement. The protein deficiency causes patients to experience profound muscle weakness and absence or loss of muscle function that gets worse over time.

Nusinersen is injected into the spine and travels to the brain, where it binds to a section of RNA transcribed from the SMN2 gene in brain cells. SMN2 is closely related to SMN1 but typically produces only a small amount of SMN protein.

Once it binds, nusinersen causes SMN2 to produce more of the protein, thus compensating for what the SMN1 mutation suppresses.

“Nusinersen was an overwhelming success — it was extremely effective in these patients — and so a lot of people became very excited about ASO technology,” Park said.

One of those people was Yu, who wondered whether he could design an ASO to treat Mila, a six-year-old girl with a rare, fatal neurodegenerative disease called Batten disease.

Yu and his team figured out that in her case, the disease was caused by a known mutation on one copy of the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis 7 (CLN7) gene, combined with another mutation on the other copy of the gene.

As a result of this duo of mutations, the child’s body could not produce enough of the CLN7 protein, leading to widespread — and worsening — nervous system problems, including seizures, poor coordination and balance, and muscle spasms and weakness.

In a matter of months, the researchers were able to create and test a personalized ASO called milasen that targeted the second gene mutation responsible for her disease.

As they had hoped, Mila’s symptoms improved during treatment: she had fewer seizures and she was better able to swallow and hold up her neck and body.

Mila died in 2021, but the researchers published their results in The New England Journal of Medicine as proof of concept that it was possible to create a safe and effective personalized ASO quickly.

The stars align

Meanwhile, Park and his research fellow at the time, Jinkuk Kim, were embarking on a journey of their own.

As a computational biologist, Park develops algorithms that analyze human genomes and look for interesting anomalies or trends — something he had been doing mostly in the context of cancer.

However, Jinkuk had an interest in ASOs and, more specifically, in finding gene mutations linked to neurodegenerative diseases that could be good targets.

Kim and Park began using their computational tools to analyze human brain sequences publicly available through the National Institutes of Health.

They were looking for something specific: genes in which a mutation on only one copy (versus both copies) is enough to alter protein production and interfere with normal function.

Eventually, they hit on GRN, a gene in which a single mutation on one copy causes brain cells to make less of a protein called progranulin.

Crucially, this GRN mutation is implicated in around 15 percent of cases of FTD — a form of dementia often diagnosed in patients between 45 and 65 years old characterized by a loss of cells in the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain.

“We had the idea that we could design an ASO that would impact the transcript of this gene in such a way that progranulin production would increase,” Park said.

However, he and Kim knew that they needed to take their idea out of the computer and into the lab for testing — so Park reached out to his old friend Yu.

When the researchers met to discuss the project, Kim asked Yu if he had ever heard of a drug called nusinersen.

Yu couldn’t help but laugh at the sheer serendipity of the situation.

“I said, ‘Actually, I’ve been doing nothing but studying nusinersen as quickly as I can for the last six months, because we are working on making a drug like it for our patient,’” Yu recalled.

Off and running

With that, Park, Kim, Yu, and Yu’s research fellow Yu-Han Huang threw themselves into developing molecules to target the gene responsible for a significant number of FTD cases.

“We began taking these skills that we were learning about ASOs and thinking about how we could apply them to this situation,” Yu said.

Their early progress was aided by a $250,000 grant from the Quadrangle Fund for Advancing and Seeding Translational Research at HMS.

Over the past few years, the researchers developed several ASOs that seem promising.

These molecules don’t bind to RNA transcribed from the mutated copy of the GRN gene that interferes with progranulin production. Instead, they attach to RNA made from the remaining healthy copy of the gene and by doing so, correct a natural inefficiency in progranulin processing.

“Our strategy is to boost progranulin output from the normal copy of the gene,” to make up for the lack of progranulin produced by the mutated copy, Huang said.

This strategy is particularly appealing, Yu added, because it means that the ASO does not need to be tailored to each patient’s specific mutation, as was the case for milasen, which was designed to target a mutation present in a single patient.

In human cells, the ASOs designed by the team have successfully increased progranulin expression.

Testing in mice would typically be the next step, but mice don’t have the genetic sequences targeted by the molecules. Instead, the researchers moved to nonhuman primates, which have the same natural inefficiency in progranulin processing as humans.

“We felt confident enough with our initial analysis that we thought we should try these ASOs in primates,” Park said.

Bolstered by $1 million in funding from a 2020 Blavatnik Therapeutics Challenge Award, a primate study is ongoing.

So far, one ASO has been tested in one animal at different timepoints and doses. The molecule does not seem to be toxic and appears to alter the GRN gene as expected.

There are also signs that the ASO increases progranulin production in the brain, although the researchers are working on developing better ways to measure protein levels.

The molecule needs to be tested in more primates, the researchers cautioned, and they also plan to test the other ASOs they designed, but the results so far seem promising.

“The ASO seems to work as well in a primate as was demonstrated in human cell lines,” Yu said. “This gets you pretty far along the path of what it takes to move something towards the clinic.”

If the primate study continues to yield the desired outcomes, the researchers plan to move on to testing the ASO in clinical trials with humans.

The ASO would not only need to alter the GRN gene and increase progranulin levels, but, most importantly, to have a functional effect on patients with FTD.

The ultimate yardstick of success, Yu said, would be demonstrable slowing of disease progression.

“Most likely, a treatment like this would be a potential way to keep the disease from progressing further,” Yu said.

More to come

The chance to work on a therapy has been especially rewarding for Park, who typically spends his time on the computational side of things, far removed from the clinic.

“We always consider how the algorithms that we develop might have some tangible impact, and this is a situation where we went from looking at genomic data to identifying the molecule and doing primate experiments in a very short time,” Park said.

“We typically think of a pharmaceutical company spending many years to develop a drug, but here, a single brilliant postdoctoral fellow at a computer used publicly available data to come up with a promising drug candidate in only a few weeks.”

The researchers remain excited about the ASOs they designed, both for their potential to become drugs for FTD, as well as for their contribution to a growing class of novel therapies. The ASOs will continue to be developed by a company set to launch later this year.

ASOs offer several advantages as therapies, Park said. They can be injected directly into the spine, which allows them to easily enter the brain without having to traverse the near-impenetrable blood–brain barrier that prevents so many medications from reaching their targets in the brain.

Also, unlike the gene-editing tool CRISPR, ASOs don’t permanently alter a patient’s DNA, which means doses can be adjusted to a patient’s changing needs over time.

Park noted that the GRN gene their ASOs target may also play a role in neurodegenerative diseases beyond FTD, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Alzheimer's.

Moreover, it may be possible to develop similar ASOs for neurodegenerative diseases or developmental conditions driven by other mutations that affect only a single gene copy.

“The question is whether you can pull this molecular trick for other neurologic gene targets,” Yu said. “One of the broader avenues for future research is exploring if this strategy can be recycled and applied to other conditions.”

The speed at which the project progressed was largely a result of a collaboration across multiple labs and areas of expertise. For Yu it also highlights the promise of gene-targeting treatments.

“Taking an idea and advancing it this far this quickly really does point out how promising this technology is. Our ASO is not a clinical drug yet — there are a lot more steps — but we showed that the concept and the strategy are robust,” Yu said.

“The story is as much about this process for making these genetically targeted therapies as it is about this particular ASO for this particular disease.”

And while the story is far from over, the researchers hope that what started as an idea and a fortuitously timed collaboration will, in the end, be life-changing for patients.","One of those people was Yu, who wondered whether he could design an ASO to treat Mila, a six-year-old girl with a rare, fatal neurodegenerative disease called Batten disease.
In a matter of months, the researchers were able to create and test a personalized ASO called milasen that targeted the second gene mutation responsible for her disease.
The stars alignMeanwhile, Park and his research fellow at the time, Jinkuk Kim, were embarking on a journey of their own.

Obesity may increase diabetic kidney disease risk, especially in women

Adults with type 2 diabetes and a higher BMI may have an increased risk for diabetic kidney disease, according to study findings published in The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism.

In findings from a generalized summary Mendelian randomization using 56 BMI-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms instrument variables, increasing BMI was linked to an increased risk for diabetic nephropathy and a lower estimated glomerular filtration rate, with the effects most pronounced among women.

The risk for diabetic nephropathy rises with each 1 kg/m2 increase in BMI, with women having a more pronounced increased risk than men. Data were derived from Lu J, et al. J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2022;doi:10.1210/clinem/dgac057.

“Our research highlights how obesity contributes to the incidence and progression of diabetic nephropathy in people with type 2 diabetes, especially for women,” Zhihong Liu, MD, director of the National Clinical Research Center of Kidney Disease at Jinling Hospital and Nanjing University School of Medicine in Nanjing, China, said in a press release. “Managing your blood pressure and blood sugar may not be enough to slow the progression to end-stage renal disease, and our study shows how important it is for people with diabetes to also manage their weight.”

Researchers conducted a Mendelian randomization analysis to evaluate the causal effect of BMI on diabetes nephropathy risk and kidney traits. Fifty-six BMI-associated genetic variants from the BioBank Japan GWAS Mendelian randomization analyses to serve as instrumental variables. The study cohort included 1,347 adults with type 2 diabetes and biopsy-proven diabetic nephropathy, and 2,716 adults with diabetes for more than 10 years and no kidney disease. Mendelian randomization was conducted with all participants to analyze the causal effect on BMI on diabetic nephropathy, eGFR and proteinuria. Subgroup analysis stratifying participants by sex was also conducted using 27 genetic variants associated with BMI in men and 16 variants associated with BMI in women.

In the Mendelian randomization analysis, each 1 kg/m2 increase in BMI was associated with a higher risk for diabetic nephropathy (OR = 3.76; 95% CI, 1.88-7.53; P < .001) and lower levels of eGFR (OR = 0.71; 95% CI, 0.59-0.86; P < .001). There was no association between BMI and proteinuria level.

In subgroup analyses, each 1 kg/m2 increase in BMI increased the risk for diabetic nephropathy for men and women. However, the increased risk was much higher among women (OR = 14.81; 95% CI, 2.67-82.05; P = .002) than men (OR = 3.48; 95% CI, 1.18-10.27; P = .02).

“The increase in BMI level had a more significant influence on the risk of diabetic nephropathy in women,” the researchers wrote. “These results provide a theoretical basis for the potential therapeutic benefits of reducing BMI to prevent the occurrence and progression of diabetic nephropathy.”

Liu said the findings confirm the importance of screening for kidney complications for adults with diabetes and obesity.

“People with diabetes and obesity should have their kidneys checked more often, as they are at high risk, and while chronic kidney disease has no cure, early detection and obesity treatment could slow the progression to end-stage kidney disease,” Liu said in a press release.","SaveObesity may increase diabetic kidney disease risk, especially in womenAdults with type 2 diabetes and a higher BMI may have an increased risk for diabetic kidney disease, according to study findings published in The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism.

On 21 March 2023, the Ministry of Health (MoH) of the United Republic of Tanzania declared an outbreak of Marburg virus disease (MVD) in the country. As of 22 March, a total of eight cases, including five deaths (case fatality ratio [CFR]: 62.5%) have been reported from two villages in Bukoba district, Kagera region, United Republic of Tanzania. Two of these cases were healthcare workers, one of whom has died. This is the first Marburg virus disease outbreak reported in the country.

As response measures, Rapid Response Teams have been deployed to investigate and implement interventions in the affected areas, including contact tracing and risk communication activities. WHO assesses the risk of spread as very high at the national level, high at the subregional level, and moderate at the regional level due to cross-border movements between Kagera region and bordering countries including Uganda in the north, Rwanda and Burundi in the west. The risk at the global level is assessed to be low.

Description of the situation

On 16 March 2023, the MoH of the United Republic of Tanzania announced that seven cases and five deaths from an unknown disease had been reported in two villages in Bukoba district, Kagera region, northern Tanzania. The cases were later confirmed as Marburg virus infection by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at the National Public Health Laboratory, Tanzania. On 21 March 2023, the MoH officially declared the first MVD outbreak in the country.

As of 22 March, eight cases, including five deaths (case fatality ratio [CFR]: 62.5%) have been reported from Kagera region. The remaining three patients are currently undergoing treatment. As of 22 March, no cases have been reported from outside the Bukoba district of Kagera Region.

The first identified case reported travel history from Goziba Island in Lake Victoria in Tanzania and developed symptoms after returning to his village in Bukoba. The case died in the community. Four additional cases were identified from the same family as this index case. Further, two cases were reported among healthcare workers who treated them, one of whom died. No information is available on the eighth case; investigations are ongoing. Reported symptoms of the patients were fever, diarrhoea, vomiting, bleeding from various sites, and kidney failure. Samples from both deceased and live cases were taken and confirmed for Marburg virus by the National Public Health Laboratory.

Epidemiology of Marburg virus disease

Marburg virus disease is an epidemic-prone disease associated with high case-fatality rates (CFR 24-90%). It is caused by the same family of viruses (Filoviridae) as Ebola virus disease and is clinically similar. The current CFR for this outbreak is relatively high, at 62.5%.

Marburg virus infection often results from prolonged exposure to mines or caves inhabited by Rousettus bat colonies. Once an individual is infected with the virus, it can spread through human-to-human transmission via direct contact with the blood, secretions or other body fluids of infected or deceased people. Healthcare workers have previously been infected while treating patients with suspected or confirmed MVD. Burial ceremonies that involve direct contact with the body of the deceased can also contribute to the transmission of Marburg.

The incubation period varies from two to 21 days. Illness caused by Marburg virus begins abruptly, with high fever, severe headache, and severe malaise. Severe watery diarrhoea, abdominal pain and cramping, nausea, and vomiting can begin around the third day. Severe haemorrhagic manifestations may appear between five and seven days from symptom onset, and fatal cases usually have some form of bleeding, often from multiple areas. In fatal cases, death occurs most often between eight and nine days after symptom onset, usually preceded by severe blood loss and shock.

Clinical diagnosis of MVD is difficult in the early phase as symptoms are similar to other febrile illnesses. The differential diagnosis for MVD may include other filovirus diseases, Lassa fever, malaria, typhoid fever, dengue, rickettsial infections, leptospirosis and plague.

Laboratory confirmation is primarily made by RT-PCR. Other tests can be used such as antibody-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), antigen-capture detection tests, serum neutralization tests, electron microscopy, and virus isolation by cell culture.

Although there are no vaccines or antiviral treatments for MVD, supportive care – such as rehydration with oral or intravenous fluids – and treatment of specific symptoms improve survival. A range of potential treatments are being evaluated, including blood products, immune therapies, and drug therapies.

This is the first time that Tanzania has reported an outbreak of MVD. Even though there is an ongoing outbreak of MVD in Equatorial Guinea (for more details, please see the Disease outbreak news published on 22 March), so far there is no evidence of an epidemiological link between the two outbreaks. Other MVD outbreaks have been previously reported in Ghana (2022), Guinea (2021), Uganda (2017, 2014, 2012, 2007), Angola (2004-2005), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (1998 and 2000), Kenya (1990, 1987, 1980) and South Africa (1975).","Situation at a glanceOn 21 March 2023, the Ministry of Health (MoH) of the United Republic of Tanzania declared an outbreak of Marburg virus disease (MVD) in the country.

Jim Poole, who spent 11 seasons as a left-handed specialist with the Orioles, Indians, Giants and five other big-league teams, reached down and snagged the ball with his pitching hand.

A wealth management advisor with an engineering degree from Georgia Tech, Poole is a numbers guy. He once took a calculator and stopwatch into the Yellow Jackets dugout to compute the true velocity of fastballs to “use some physics.”

But even a math nerd like Poole can’t calculate how many times he’s cupped a baseball in his left hand, how many times he’s launched it into the air. Hundreds of thousands? A million?

As the high schooler approached to retrieve the ball that afternoon, Poole flipped it underhand.

“It went about 12 feet forward and almost all to the right. It was really weird,” Poole said. “Let’s just say the kid looked at me and never would have believed I had ever earned a living playing baseball.”

By then, Poole knew something was off. His left arm — his moneymaker all those years — had been weakening for months. He assumed all those hard sliders had finally sought retribution from his elbow and shoulder.

While seeing an orthopedist about his arm, he mentioned his left leg also felt weak, unstable.

The red flags rose. Appointments with specialists increased.

In June, at age 55, Poole heard the three words he was dreading but, frankly, expecting.

“You have ALS.”

Jim Poole and his boxer, Remington.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig’s Disease, is a neurodegenerative condition affecting nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord that ultimately leads to atrophy and the inability to control muscle action.

There is no cure. No treatment to slow the trajectory.

The typical ALS patient lives two to five years after diagnosis. Some, like Chuck Campbell, the close friend of former Orioles shortstop J.J. Hardy, die within a year of diagnosis.

For others, such as former Baltimore Ravens special teams standout O.J. Brigance, who was diagnosed with ALS in 2007 but is still serving as a Ravens senior advisor, the disease works slower. Renowned English physicist Stephen Hawking lasted an incredible 55 years with ALS.

Approximately 30,000 people in the United States are living with the disease at any given time. Roughly 5,000 new cases are diagnosed each year.

Because of its connection to Gehrig, the former New York Yankees’ Hall of Fame first baseman who died at age 37 on June 2, 1941, Major League Baseball has adopted ALS as one of its charity causes, and last year created Lou Gehrig Day to bring awareness to the disease every June 2.

Poole is believed to be only the third MLB player of prominence to have contracted ALS, joining Gehrig and Hall of Fame pitcher Jim “Catfish” Hunter, who died at 53 in 1999, about a year after his diagnosis.

There are at least two other former big leaguers — both played prior to 1950 — who developed ALS, but only three with lengthy MLB careers: Two Hall of Famers and a left-handed reliever who plugged away for a decade.

“I’d like to apologize to Lou Gehrig and Catfish Hunter for being mentioned in the same sentence,” Poole deadpanned.

He maintains his dry sense of humor. And his mathematical mind. Although there only have been a handful of ballplayers with ALS in MLB’s history (roughly .0002 percent) that number is still higher than the general population that lives with ALS in the United States (.00006 percent).

“I’ve thought about that,” Poole said. “Because, clearly, it is so unique.”

There is no ALS test to take, no way to know immediately one has the disease. Instead, doctors rule out possibilities before leaving ALS as the only viable option.

Poole endured that process, leading him to an appointment in June with Dr. Jonathan Glass, director of the Emory ALS Center in Atlanta.

Two weeks prior, during the Memorial Day weekend, the Pooles were together with their three children, Austin, 29, Hayden, 26, and Courtney, 24. That’s when they delivered the initial news.

The conversation went like this: We think Dad could have ALS. We hope not. But understand it’s the worst-case scenario.

“We needed to start preparing them,” said Poole’s wife, Kim. “We were still pretty hopeful at that point, but the kids knew something wasn’t right as of Memorial Day.”

When the couple met with Glass, the doctor didn’t waste time. He asked Poole if he had a sense of what was happening. Poole didn’t say much. His wife wanted to scream, “ALS,” but she was still clinging to hope. Then Glass spoke.

“I believe his quote was, ‘They tell you you can’t diagnose ALS. But I recognize ALS like I recognize my grandmother. You have ALS,’” Jim Poole remembers the doctor saying.

“It was a gut punch. Just an immediate emotional release that we’d been holding in,” Kim Poole said. “And probably the worst part was they basically left the room, came back a couple minutes later, and said to Jim, ‘You need to do a breathing test.’ And so I was in that room, completely by myself, for a while.”

June 15, 2021, was the most difficult day of Poole’s life.

It wasn’t until later that he realized it was also the 31st anniversary of one of his greatest moments.

He was called up to the big leagues for the first time on June 13, 1990, by the Los Angeles Dodgers, the team that drafted him in the ninth round out of Georgia Tech in 1988.

But the then-24-year-old didn’t actually make his debut until two days later at Dodger Stadium in an eventual 3-1, 13-inning victory over the San Diego Padres.

Jim Poole’s major-league debut was with the Los Angeles Dodgers on June 15, 1990. On that same day, 31 years later, he was diagnosed with ALS.

Poole was called on to handle one batter, a lefty, to start the 11th inning. He struck out the guy on five pitches, the last one a slider looking, to pick up the first out and strikeout of a big-league career that spanned 431 appearances.

It was an auspicious debut considering the lone batter he faced was future Hall of Famer Tony Gwynn, one of the greatest hitters and most difficult men to strike out in baseball history.

And it was typical of Poole’s career in college, the minors, the majors. Little fanfare or glory. Just key situations in which he stayed calm and did his job.

In Baltimore, Poole served as a key member of a strong Orioles bullpen in the early 1990s. From 1991 to 1994, Poole posted a 2.86 ERA in 123 games. He is the last Oriole to record a win at Memorial Stadium (Oct. 5, 1991) and the only Oriole to pitch in the final three games there.

His most indelible moment in the major leagues, however, was on the losing end with Cleveland, giving up one of the more memorable postseason home runs in the past three decades: the sixth-inning solo blast by Atlanta Braves slugger David Justice in the Game 6 clincher of the 1995 World Series. It was the only run scored in a pitchers’ battle in which future Hall of Famer Tom Glavine and closer Mark Wohlers combined for a one-hit shutout against Cleveland’s mighty lineup.

Afterward, Poole answered reporters’ questions thoughtfully and thoroughly.

“When you have a bad game or bad outing, there are some guys that want to go hide in the training room for a while,” said former Cleveland reliever Paul Assenmacher, one of Poole’s closest friends. “That wasn’t Jim. We all knew exactly where he’d be. Standing up and facing the music.”

Before Poole starts talking, he offers a disclaimer. It’s possible he’ll sob on the other end of the telephone, he warns.

He’s not afraid a particular question will be too sensitive, too difficult to answer. He wants to bring awareness to this destructive disease, to raise money in hopes that one day there will be a cure.

It’s just that one of the side effects of ALS is having difficulty controlling emotions, whether it’s laughter or tears. He can’t always reel it in, a contrast to the days when he’d coolly attack hitters with a steely nerve.

Poole, however, remains composed during the interview; it’s his loved ones who struggle talking about it. Two admit they seriously considered rejecting the interview request. Because the situation is so damn unfair. And still so raw.

Assenmacher remembers when Poole informed him last summer at a reunion of former Cleveland players. They had come from a golf outing when Poole pulled him aside near a hotel elevator.

“I started crying,” Assenmacher said. “And then I said, ‘How are you doing?’ And he said, ‘I’m good. We’re learning to deal with this thing.’ I just couldn’t believe how stoic he was. He was fine, and I’m crying like a baby.”

Jim Morris, the legendary college baseball coach at Georgia Tech and later at the University of Miami, had dinner with his wife and the Pooles in December.

Morris knew of Poole’s disease but hadn’t seen him since the diagnosis. The Pooles made it to the restaurant first and were sitting at the table when Morris and his wife arrived. They had a wonderful time, talking and laughing. About three-quarters through the meal, Poole excused himself to go to the bathroom. He rose, grabbed his cane and struggled toward the restroom, swaying and teetering until reaching the door.

“I watched him walk to the bathroom and it was very tough to handle for me and for my wife. And, of course, Kim was looking at us. She saw how we were handling it, so it was tough for her too,” Morris said. “His back was turned, and he was walking to the bathroom and that’s when it really, really hit me. Because you’re sitting there talking to him and he’s as sharp as a tool.”

Jim and Kim Poole.

A 6-foot-2, 190-pound athlete in his prime, Poole was training for a 5K with his wife in late 2020 when they both noticed he had some difficulty running. Kim, who played soccer at Georgia Tech, joked she wasn’t initially concerned because Poole was a pitcher — a breed that doesn’t typically excel at running.

Rapidly, however, walking became an issue.

“Early on, she told me she thought that I was drunk every morning that I got out of bed. So that gives you an idea of what it looks like,” Poole said. “And that has progressively gotten worse.”

Fast forward a year and Poole is mostly using a wheelchair. He can still walk with a cane, but the process is so tedious it’s reserved for brief tasks.

Range of motion and strength in his left arm is minimal. Gripping anything with his left hand is labor, so cradling a baseball isn’t an option anymore. He can still write his name, but it no longer matches his crisp autograph of yesteryear. He must do nearly everything right-handed these days.

“I was definitely not ambidextrous,” Poole said. “My right side existed for balance and maybe catching the ball being thrown back to me. So, it has been quite the adjustment having to basically become right-handed.”

During the past two months, he said, his speech, “has definitely shown deterioration in strength and clarity,” though he is easy to understand during the interview.

Despite the challenges, Poole continues to work every day from his home office as a wealth management advisor for professional players. He has no plans to quit.

“We take it day-by-day, and I’m not going to make that decision for him,” said Bill Harris, CEO and co-founder of BIP (Buckhead Investment Partners) Wealth. “I want Jim to be a part of it as long as he wants to be a part of it. And, based on my conversations with Jim, it will be up until his last days.”

It’s an odd path: An engineering major and ex-big-leaguer becoming an investment manager.

A dozen years passed from the time Poole left Georgia Tech with an electrical engineering degree and a minor in computer engineering until he retired from baseball. Those fields changed dramatically in that span. His knowledge was practically obsolete.

So, he pursued other interests, or as he put it, he had “a bunch of itches and I was able to scratch them.” He helped his alma mater with fundraising. He opened an indoor batting facility. He taught high school math for three years and coached high school baseball.

What he learned from those experiences is he enjoyed working with people, especially young ballplayers, and making a difference in people’s lives.

While with the Orioles in 1993, he joined the players union’s pension committee; he’s still an active member of its board. Initially, he mostly did his own investing. In 2007, he became an original investor of BIP, the company set up by Harris and co-founder Mark Buffington, both former Georgia Tech ballplayers.

Shortly thereafter, Poole started working part-time at BIP as a portfolio manager. With his mathematical and analytical skills, it fit well. He worked alongside Harris — literally sharing the same desk — during those startup days in a recession, and he listened and learned about what it took to be a wealth advisor.

Over time, Poole and BIP recognized ballplayers have a unique set of circumstances preparing for their futures. There’s a small window of lucrative earnings. Most have been playing since they were kids and have never held 9-to-5 jobs. Additionally, most don’t have the time while playing to delve into pension complexities, insurance policies or investments.

In 2017, BIP created a baseball division with Poole as director. Currently, he and three other former pro players handle the portfolios of more than 85 clients in the industry. Poole is involved in most aspects of the division, including recruiting high school and college draftees. It’s why he was at that prep game last April, to meet a potential high draft pick and his parents.

It’s been the perfect occupation for Poole to stay in the game and make a good living while using his brainpower to help a younger generation.

That’s why Harris was a little concerned when Poole asked if they could meet at his house last summer — away from the office and their co-workers. Had he found another job in the industry? Retiring was possible, but that seemed a little premature. Poole appeared relatively healthy.

“When I got over there, he and Kim delivered the news,” Harris said. “It was five times worse than what I would have ever expected as I was driving over there.”

Poole’s ties to Georgia Tech run deep, despite graduating nearly 35 years ago.

It’s where he met Kim at freshman orientation; they’ve been a couple since, celebrating their 32nd wedding anniversary in December.

A two-time, All-ACC reliever, Poole still holds Yellow Jackets’ records for career saves, appearances in a season and strikeouts per nine. He was inducted into the school’s Sports Hall of Fame in 1997.

But he almost didn’t make it there. Poole was 2-16 in three years pitching for a struggling LaSalle College High School team in suburban Philadelphia. He received no Division I college offers. Georgia Tech’s Morris had never heard of the lefty when Jim Zerilla, a former minor-league player, coach and scout, called to recommend Poole.

Morris listened and brought the kid in with no scholarship. Poole barely pitched his freshman year; he wasn’t mature enough physically or mentally, Morris said. That first season, Morris sat down with Poole and had a tough-love conversation: He needed to be more team-oriented and baseball-focused or he wouldn’t last in the program.

By his senior year, Poole had become team captain, earned a “substantial” scholarship and, Morris said, grew into one of the finest young men he had ever mentored.

It’s a common sentiment among those who spent time with Poole throughout his career.

“I’m a hockey fan, a big Detroit Red Wings fan and when they talked about Niklas Lidstrom, the former Red Wing, his teammates used to call him, ‘The Perfect Human.’ And that’s kind of how I see Jim,” Assenmacher said, choking back tears. “Just a great guy.”

In January, Georgia Tech announced the Jim Poole Endowed Baseball Scholarship had been created in honor of the program’s most successful closer. Four businessmen, including the co-founders of BIP, each pledged $25,000 to get the scholarship started.

Harris said there’s now more than $200,000 in the fund, which will help the athletic department pay for one baseball scholarship annually.

“I was unbelievably overwhelmed. I had no idea that they were considering doing it. I was touched beyond belief,” Poole said. “The word humbled keeps coming up because that’s what it felt like. Very humbled that people would do that for me.”

Fittingly, the scholarship sponsors are listed, simply, as “Friends of Jim Poole.”

Poole is the one who others lean on. Who listens and dispenses advice, if necessary. The rock.

So, what happens when someone like that receives life-altering news?

Poole turned to another late-inning reliever: His buddy Gregg Olson, who first became his teammate as part of Team USA at the 1987 Pan American Games before sharing bullpens in Baltimore and Cleveland.

Olson, 55, was diagnosed with prostate cancer in January 2021 and had his prostate removed that April. During the ordeal, Olson was incredibly public, detailing his battle on social media.

Poole admired Olson’s openness. And his faith.

“I knew he was somebody I could rely on to help anchor me, especially on the faith side,” Poole said. “He was there for me as an outlet to just tell him whatever is going on. I don’t hide what is happening with me, but I don’t necessarily talk about it a lot either, unless asked. But Gregg has stepped up as someone in my life, and a former teammate, that allows me to kind of open up a little more.”

Olson had no connections to ALS when Poole reached out. He quickly researched it and was despondent about what he discovered. But he knows Poole — and what he needed.

“I just flat-out said, ‘Look, man, I appreciated when people would say to me, “How are you doing? What’s going on?”’” Olson recalled. “So, I said, ‘If you have a problem with me just being blunt, then you need to let me know, because I’m gonna ask. I wanna find out what’s going on.’”

That began their near-weekly phone calls. Olson recommends Bible verses that provide strength and comfort and prays for Poole every morning. And, if he doesn’t hear from Poole, he picks up the dropped ball from his old set-up man.

“I get this buzz in my head if it’s been more than a week,” Olson said. “I’ll get this (feeling), ‘Hey, you need to call Jim. You need to call Jim.’ I’ve learned to listen to that voice in my head.”

No one in this situation shoulders a heavier burden than Kim Poole.

Once the initial shock of the diagnosis waned, the Pooles attacked their altered future like the pair of engineers they are.

“We basically went home and said, ‘OK, let’s figure out how we’re gonna do life, what we need to do to fight it or live with it or whatever it brings,’” she said.

The first task was brutal. Kim’s father had just died. The family was gathering to mourn. It’s never easy to get adult children in one place, so Kim and Jim had no alternative but to tell their children the news on the night before their grandfather’s funeral. They had been warned on Memorial Day, but now their children’s despair would be doubled.

Kim Poole also had to manage her own feelings, her own anger, while staying positive for her husband. His medical reality had blown up their dreams.

The Pooles had managed their money well. They were empty nesters and had downsized their house, purchasing a condominium. They became grandparents in 2020 and have a second grandchild on the way. With a comfortable nest egg, they could retire whenever they wanted.

“Pretty much my life revolves around figuring out ALS and caring for him now. I’ve stopped working. I used to take care of my grandson, and I wasn’t gonna be doing that long-term, but now I don’t get to see him like I would have,” she said. “We were gearing up for traveling and doing stuff with a lot of our friends that had just started to retire. So, that’s the biggest change in the future. That’s not really possible now.”

Yet, somehow, Kim Poole isn’t dwelling on what could have been. She’s scanned ALS message boards and has read the bitterness. And she’s promised herself she’s not going there.

“A lot of it is, ‘ALS stands for always losing something.’ Or ‘You’re a widow in waiting’ or things like that. I don’t really see it as that,” Kim Poole said. “I see it as more I’m always having to learn something new. I’m always trying to figure out the next day.”

It’s not something she’d wish on anyone. But she’s trying to maintain her sanity, faith and sense of humor.

“We have a great family and great friends and have had a great life. That’s probably what makes it so hard. I remember saying to my kids, ‘You know, if your dad was a real asshole, this wouldn’t probably be so hard,’” she said, chuckling through tears. “But it is hard to watch your best friend die a little bit each day. But I certainly don’t want the alternative.”

What happens between now and the inevitable ending is the Pooles’ primary focus. More time with family. More work to do.

He has made a personal commitment to help raise awareness for ALS. He has joined the board of The ALS Cure Project, a nonprofit established in 2019 to honor the memory of Gretchen Piscotty, the mother of big-league outfielder Stephen Piscotty.

Poole also is a supporter of Project ALS, which was the world’s first organization to focus exclusively on ALS research.

So much more can be learned about the disease, and Poole said that’s why he’s come forward. Personally, he said he’d much rather keep his struggle private. But this is bigger than him.

“I’m in a position to continue to make a positive impact,” Poole said “God put me here for a reason and that’s all good. I’ll deal with it and, hopefully, some people will draw strength from it.”

The guy who couldn’t get a DI baseball scholarship out of high school, who struggled early in college before excelling, who eventually was drafted in the ninth round and lasted 11 seasons in the majors, who served up a career-defining homer and who succeeded in a second career obviously doesn’t surrender easily.

That husband, father, grandfather, advisor, teammate and mentor is dealing with the cruelest of blows. He wants you to know about it. And know it’s OK.

“I have led an incredibly blessed life for 55 years. This is now just part of that life and we’re gonna see what we can accomplish each day when we wake up,” Poole said. “It’s just never been an option to think any differently than, ‘How am I gonna make today a really good day?’”

TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — Before Trayvon Martin , George Floyd , Michael Brown , Breonna Taylor and other Black people died at the hands of white police officers or self-appointed vigilantes, there was Martin Lee Anderson.

Anderson, a 14-year-old Black teenager, died in 2006 after he was kicked and beaten by guards at a boot-camp juvenile facility in Florida. His family looked for a lawyer to seek justice. No white attorneys wanted to take it on.

That was the first high-profile civil rights case at the national level for Ben Crump, a Black attorney from Florida. Now, Crump is a familiar presence at almost every major civil rights case in the country.

“Ben has always been a fighter for justice ... to shine a light on things that are not right,” said Leon Russell, chair of the NAACP National Board of Directors.

Staff at the facility where Anderson died were acquitted of criminal charges, but Crump later won a civil case for the boy’s family.

That was only the beginning.

When Trayvon Martin, 17, was fatally shot on Feb. 26, 2012, at a condominium complex in Sanford, Florida, his killer, George Zimmerman, was not initially arrested. Zimmerman, whose father is white and whose mother is Hispanic, was a self-appointed, armed neighborhood watcher who eventually claimed self-defense and was acquitted of murder charges.

Martin, wearing a hoodie that would soon become an iconic image, was returning to his father’s condo from a convenience store with a can of ice tea and a bag of Skittles when he was confronted by Zimmerman.

Crump pushed for Zimmerman’s arrest and joined with many prominent civil rights leaders to stage demonstrations calling for charges.

It was the Trayvon Martin case that gave rise to the Black Lives Matter movement, and Crump deserves much of the credit for that, the Rev. Jesse Jackson said in an interview with The Associated Press.

“It was a new stream of consciousness,” Jackson said. “We decided we’re not going back. Everything else has come out of that. Don’t Black lives matter? It made a big difference.”

Crump has been called Black America’s attorney general for his unwavering work on civil rights cases, especially those involving Black people killed by police. In an interview, Crump said he does not take that label lightly.

“I try as sincerely as possible to give a voice to those who have no voice,” Crump said. “If I can see further, it’s because I am standing on the shoulders of giants.”

Crump, 52, was born in Lumberton, North Carolina, one of nine siblings, but wound up attending high school in Plantation, Florida. From there it was Florida State University for college and law school and then a law firm with partner Daryl Parks in Tallahassee. They took on the Martin Lee Anderson case.

Now, Crump has his own firm that handles civil rights cases across the country. He recites an African proverb to illustrate why it is so important to stand up for Black people who are victims of injustice.

“As long as the lion hunter gets to tell the story of the hunt, and the lions never get to tell the story, then all the glory will always go to the lion hunter,” Crump said. “Unless you have the historical knowledge of the culture, to hand down generation upon generation, then we are doomed to repeat the lessons we should have learned.”

Crump, who is seen almost everywhere a civil rights case emerges, still lives in Tallahassee with his wife Genae, who is assistant principal at a Leon County public school for at-risk kids, and their daughter, Brooklyn. He has won financial settlements in about 200 police brutality cases, including a $27 million settlement for George Floyd’s family in the infamous Minneapolis case.

But he is not without his detractors. Samaria Rice, the mother of 12-year-old Tamir Rice , who was fatally shot by a white Cleveland police officer while holding a toy gun in 2014, released a statement at the time that criticized both Black Lives Matter activists and Crump.

Samaria Rice said they should “step down, stand back, and stop monopolizing and capitalizing our fight for justice and human rights.” The statement also questioned whether Crump understood Ohio law. “I fired him 6-8 months into Tamir’s case,” she wrote.

But Jackson, who marched with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and was with King when he was assassinated in 1968, said Crump is part of the new generation of civil rights leaders.

“Now we do have people at the state and national level to hold people accountable. We will have justice,” Jackson said.

When Crump thinks about the Trayvon Martin case, he said it’s clear there is much more work to be done.

“Are we making progress? Are we going backwards?” he said. “I think about Trayvon Martin and the unknown Trayvon Martins, so often, when we think about the history of America. Who tells their story? Every day is a new day for us to make history.”","That was the first high-profile civil rights case at the national level for Ben Crump, a Black attorney from Florida.

Dr Audrey Yeo, a forensic pathologist from the Health Sciences Authority, said this on Monday as she testified on the first day of a coroner’s inquiry into the death of Yong Jing Yu.

The infant had been under the care of the nanny since he was around three months old.

On Dec 28, 2021, the day of his death, the nanny fed him milk and put him to bed in a playpen at around 3pm, said investigation officer (IO) Russel Tong on Monday.

When the nanny found him in a prone position with his face down around 6.20pm and saw that his face had turned blue, she called for an ambulance.

IO Tong, who is a senior staff sergeant at Ang Mo Kio Police Division, said the Singapore Civil Defence Force gave the nanny instructions to try to resuscitate the baby.

Paramedics took over resuscitation efforts when they arrived, and the baby was taken to Sengkang General Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

The police do not suspect foul play, said IO Tong.

Dr Yeo provided the final cause of death to be unascertained, as there are three possible causes that could have led to Jing Yu’s death.

She testified that the first is positional asphyxia as the baby was found face down.

In highlighting the second possible cause, she said she also found some acute inflammation in Jing Yu’s lungs. But as the inflammation was not extensive enough to point to pneumonia, this finding is insufficient to be labelled as the final cause of death.

The third possible reason, Dr Yeo said, is a gene mutation. During the autopsy, she found a gene mutation which affects the transportation of ions to the heart.

“Any mutations to this gene could cause abnormal heart rhythms. If the heart cannot beat regularly, it may not be able to sustain life. But it is not known whether this caused the death of Jing Yu,” she said.

Dr Yeo noted that while these three points are possible causes of death, she is unable to rule one cause to be more likely than the other.","The infant had been under the care of the nanny since he was around three months old.

Innovative approaches for HD therapeutics

Chairing the third session of HD research talks is Dr. Michael Finley (CHDI) and Dr. William Martin (Janssen R&D, LLC) are chairing the third session of HD research talks, which will cover innovative approaches for HD therapeutics.

The Davidson lab is working with CRISPR

Our first talk is from Dr. Beverly L Davidson from The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia & University of Pennsylvania, who will discuss her work on improving gene therapies for HD.

Improving gene therapies for HD

The Davidson lab works on making gene therapies to treat genetic illnesses like HD. She’s focused on what part of the huntingtin gene to target and how best to get drugs to the brain. Researchers want to make sure they’re doing this as efficiently as possible. As we learned yesterday, there are small toxic fragments of huntingtin that exist at the beginning of the code - exon1. The Davidson lab is focused on making sure this part of the huntingtin gene is targeted by the therapies they’re developing.

The Davidson lab is working with CRISPR - this is a very precise tool which can edit specific letters in the DNA code. The lab aims to take advantage of unique genetic signatures, called SNPs (“snips”), to target the expanded huntingtin gene. Using this approach, researchers identify SNPs that are only on expanded huntingtin. This allows their potential therapeutics to specifically target only harmful huntingtin, leaving “normal” huntingtin alone. In a mouse model of HD, they showed that their CRISPR tool reduced the levels of huntingtin protein by about 50% - the magic number researchers think we need to lower huntingtin by to improve symptoms of HD.

Next the Davidson lab focused on how to improve the way that these tools are delivered to cells. They want to make sure they’re effective and safe. The Davidson lab used a neat genetic trick to allow precise tuning to the expression level of the gene of interest, which you can think of like a dimmer switch. We previously wrote about this cool new tool here: https://en.hdbuzz.net/311

This molecular dimmer switch could be really powerful for HD research - it could allow precise control of huntingtin levels, it gets directly to the right places in the brain, and leaves the body of the mouse quickly after they stop delivering it. The Davidson lab have now refined this tool for use in HD models and showed that they can fine tune huntingtin levels - the more drug they treat with, the more the dimmer switch is lowered.

Moving forward, they’re focused on improving the way this CRISPR tool is delivered and testing it in other types of animals, including monkeys. They delivered this tool to the monkeys through a spinal injection and found that even very low doses reached lots of different areas in the brain, including those most affected by HD.

Overall, the Davidson lab has developed an exciting new tool that targets only the expanded huntingtin copy and can reach many areas of the brain. This occurs even at low doses and can be precisely controlled. We’re excited to see where this goes next!

Next up is Gene Yeo, from the University of California, San Diego, who will also be talking about CRISPR technology and testing genetic treatments in different animal models of HD. The Yeo lab is focused on understanding proteins that bind to the genetic message - RNA. They’re trying to target these RNA-binding proteins to develop therapeutics.

RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) can control expression of other genes. The Yeo lab wants to know where RBPs bind, and have developed tools that let them learn this in individual cells - wow!

Many experiments look at changes in whole tissues, or samples created from many cells. Looking at individual cells lets researchers zoom in on subtle but potentially important changes. A recent publication from the Yeo lab showed that they could use RBPs to bind to certain RNAs to “chew them up”. This would be great for destroying the huntingtin message to treat HD!

Most recently, they have shown a decrease in the huntingtin message by delivering RBPs that specifically target CAG repeats. They can do this in multiple models, including human neurons created from stem cells. When the CAG repeats in the huntingtin message were destroyed, they were able to reverse some changes in cells caused by HD! One change they noticed was that expression of genes associated with brain cell health went back to normal. But they wanted to know what happens when they use this therapy in mice - does destroying the CAG repeats with their cool tool make the HD mice better?

Yes! The mice did better on performance tests, had reduced huntingtin protein clumps, and improvements in brain structures seen by MRI. Also important, this genetic approach didn’t seem to affect other genes. This cool new tool still needs some validation but has lots of promise for many diseases, most excitingly, for HD!

Microglia act as the immune system of the brain

SHIELD HD - supporting clinical and biomarker development!

Our next speakers are Drs. Irina Antonijevic & Peter Bialek from Triplet Therapeutics. They’ll be discussing the SHIELD HD trial, a study that followed HD patients over time to try to find clinical differences and identify biomarkers.

Triplet is researching therapies to combat the expansion of CAG repeats in brain cells over time, a process known as somatic instability. This may be an important driver of symptom onset in people with HD. By looking at data from all the genetic information from individuals with HD, researchers identified changes in genes that control somatic instability that modify the age that HD patients develop HD. One of those genes is called MSH3. While Triplet is developing a therapy that targets MSH3, they are also keen to better understand when best to treat patients and which patients would benefit most from the MSH3 targeting therapy.

To better understand how CAG repeat expansion relates to HD symptoms, we need to follow people over time. SHIELD-HD is known as a natural history study - it does not involve a drug, but it is monitoring people with the HD gene who have very early symptoms.

They followed HD patients for over 2 years and took various samples, including blood and CSF. They also analyzed the patients’ brains using MRI scans. They found that different regions of the brain, called the caudate and ventricles, changed their size over time during the 48 week period of the SHIELD-HD study. This is as we would expect as symptoms progress in people with HD.

The study also looked at another measurement called the total motor score to see how this changed over time in people in the trial. As expected, this also decreased over time, and more so for patients at the later stages of HD. While these changes are expected in HD patients, the SHIELD-HD trial provides researchers with a comprehensive dataset that can be used to better make predictions about the course of HD. These types of datasets could help expedite finding the right type of clinical trial for patients based on where they are during their disease.

Next, Triplet will share updates about their drug that targets the gene MSH3. They did experiments in monkeys to see how reducing MSH3 levels affected their CAG repeats. By lowering MSH3 by 50% in the monkeys, they found that somatic expansion was stopped! If this translates to HD patients, this might significantly delay the age at which patients start to develop symptoms.

Triplet is also interested in measuring MSH3 levels to track HD disease progression and how well the treatment is working. But they ran into a challenge since it’s difficult to detect this gene in brain tissue. To get around this problem, the team at Triplet looked at expression of MSH3 in spinal fluid from participants with HD who were in the SHIELD-HD trial. They had to develop a very sensitive technique. They are continuing to experiment with different ways to collect samples from the spinal fluid and brain in monkeys, as well as testing the drug they are developing, called TTX-3360.

They looked at levels of MSH3 in the CSF of patients at various disease stages. They found no difference in these levels between individuals without HD and those with HD who had no symptoms or were very early in their disease. This finding is important because it gives researchers at Triplet a baseline reading of MSH3 to follow for when they move TTX-3360 to a Phase 1 clinical trial and look to see how the levels of MSH3 change with treatment. Observational trials like SHIELD-HD not only collect lots of valuable data from HD patients over time, but they also allow researchers to develop new potential treatments like those described by Triplet today. Cool stuff!

Time for a break! We’ll be back shortly for the rest of this mornings presentations. Stay tuned!

New biological insights

Next up is Dr. Beth Stevens from Boston Children’s Hospital and the Broad Institute, who will be talking about her research that could provide insight for moving treatments toward the clinic. Dr. Stevens studies yet another specialized brain cell, called microglia, which act as the immune system of the brain, protecting it from invaders, and helping clean up debris left over from damaged brain cells.

Microglia are tiny (thus the “micro”), and make up about only about 10% of the cells of the brain. But when they encounter damage, or invading bacteria, they get activated and go to work cleaning up the mess. This activation of these key helper cells is normally a good thing for the brain, but in a range of diseases - including HD - it has long been thought that they might be a little too active.

Stevens is a world expert on the role of microglia in health and disease. Stevens has shown that one of the roles of microglia in the brain is to eat up synapses - the bulb-like links between communicating brain cells called neurons. Synapses are good, but need to be cleared to to encode new information into the brain.

The Stem Cells for HD consortium are coordinating efforts to develop potential cell-replacement treatments for HD

There’s a cell-to-cell communication system called the “complement system” that tells microglia to eat, or not to eat, a given synapse or cell. Years ago, Stevens’ team discovered that this complement system is used in the brain by microglia to decide which brain bits need to be digested. In many brain diseases - including HD - this complement system becomes over-active, eating bits clearly labeled with a “don’t eat me” signal for the complement system. The team is interested in understanding whether the complement system plays a key role in the loss of synapses known to happen in HD.

They’ve developed very sophisticated microscope tricks to identify specific populations of synapses in brain regions impacted by HD. In HD mice, there’s a very specific pattern of synapse loss that worsens during aging. Similar changes are seen in HD patient brains. As they’d seen in other diseases, these same vulnerable synapses were decorated with “eat me” signals for the complement system. That suggests that microglia in HD mice and patients might help remove these critical synapses from the brain, potentially contributing to disease progression.

In brains donated by HD patients, Stevens’ team found clear evidence of angry, activated, microglia. They then turned back to mice, where they can manipulate this system to see what role it plays in disease progression. A company - Annexon Biosciences - has developed a drug that blocks complement activation. This allows us to ask whether blocking this hyper-active “eat me” activity contributes to the development of HD-like symptoms in HD model mice. Treating HD mice with this drug did what it was supposed to do - it reduced the “eat me” label from being placed onto critical brain regions. This allows us to ask whether this synapse removal is good or bad in diseases like HD. Using another approach - a genetic change to the mice to fully block the complement system - the team is studying the relationship between complement activation and symptoms. Excitingly, they see protection from some HD-like symptoms in HD model mice.

But what about HD patients, do similar things happen in the brains of real patients? Using Clarity, the team was able to get access to cerebrospinal fluid from HD patients. This fluid, which bathes the brain, can be a non-invasive way to sample brain proteins. Consistent with their predictions, there were clear signs of increased activation of the complement system in the spinal fluid from HD patients. A small human study in HD patients is being conducted currently by Annexon.

Very cool to see how seemingly very basic biological studies can be quickly translated to trials in HD patients!

Stem cell research!

Dr. Leslie Thompson, from UC Irvine, is up next. Thompson has been a long-time leader in the field using stem cells to understand and treat HD. Stem cells are very special cells that can be coaxed to become any other cell type in the body, including the brain cells that are vulnerable in HD.

Historically, these cells had to be isolated from human embryos, but more recently researchers have learned to coax regular cells from adult humans to become stem cells. These “induced pluripotent stem cells” are an amazing tool, allowing researchers to generate real brain cells in the lab.

Dr. Thompson represents a large consortium - called Stem Cells for HD (SC4HD) - who are coordinating efforts to develop potential cell-replacement treatments for HD. They’ve carried out huge studies to develop stem cell lines as a potential source for transplant studies into people with HD. Cells are complicated! The team has carried out a huge amount of standardization to make a very well-characterized source of donor cells. They’re using these human stem cell lines in experiments in HD mouse models to see whether transplanting cells into the brain improves HD-like symptoms in mice. Excitingly, transplantation of human stem cells leads to significant improvements. This is a proof of concept to show that implanting stem cells can lead to some improvements in HD-relevant symptoms in mice. Understanding the underpinnings of these improvements might allow the team to predict what symptoms to go after in HD patients.

Long-term mouse studies show quite striking improvement in the movement symptoms of an HD mouse model treated with human stem cell transplants. Excitingly, the team has been able to refine their procedures to increase the survival of transplanted cells.

Thompson outlines the consortium’s clinical studies to meet all the requirements of regulators for trials in humans. An obvious concern with stem cells is making sure they don’t grow into unexpected cell types, or cause tumors. These enabling studies are underway - including testing the surgical approaches needed to implant stem cells into the right place in the HD brain. We don’t want transplants into the wrong spot!

That wraps up an exciting series of talks focused on novel treatments for HD. This afternoon is a featured speaker, David Baker, from the University of Washington. We’ll not tweet that talk - so stay tuned for more exciting updates tomorrow!","Triplet is researching therapies to combat the expansion of CAG repeats in brain cells over time, a process known as somatic instability.

516,516,https://www.news-medical.net/health/Importance-of-Early-Detection-for-Kidney-Disease.aspx,Importance of Early Detection for Kidney Disease,"Currently, approaching 700 million people across the world have chronic kidney disease, with the numbers increasing yearly; worldwide, the burden continues to rise. Chronic kidney disease is a major threat to public health; the World Health Organization ranked CKD as the 10th most common cause of death – an endemic that is most marked in low-income and lower-middle-income countries, where appropriate measures, infrastructure, and resources for treating patients with advanced chronic kidney disease are insufficient.

Chronic kidney disease has often been neglected across national healthcare strategy considerations, predominantly being associated with a lack of awareness and understanding among key stakeholders including patients, healthcare professionals, and policymakers.

There is a significant unmet medical need for chronic kidney disease. Chronic kidney disease is a non-communicable condition that is categorized into five stages of severity; it often remains undetected in its earlier stages. The final stage of the condition is kidney failure, but for patients who have been diagnosed with chronic kidney disease, kidney function declines with time. Alarmingly, renal functional capacity can decline to 90% before symptoms appear. As patients with chronic kidney disease progressively decline to stage liver failure, there is an increased urgency for dialysis or kidney transplantation. Both of these treatment options are significantly invasive, time-consuming, and present a large economic burden.

Chronic Kidney Disease Cure is Costly

The prevalence of chronic kidney disease, while a global threat, is most pronounced in its growth in low income and low middle-income countries (LLMICs); within high-income countries (HICs), it is found to be most pronounced amongst the most disadvantaged, often indigenous communities who are often excluded from care systems as access is significantly curtailed.

Cost, leadership, workforce, and structural elements of healthcare present the most notable barriers to accessing kidney health care in LLMICs; however, the impact of the cost of care and treatment as well as excessive point of service payment systems affect patients most directly, producing the most devastating outcomes.

Governments cover costs for dialysis in HICs, however, patients in LLMICs are often burdened with the responsibility of partly, or fully covering the cost of their treatment out of pocket. For example, one study has estimated that in Kenya, Senegal, and Nigeria, the annual cost of hemodialysis (in international dollars) is $1.7 billion, $3.5 billion, and $450 million, respectively; this maps to 15.2 percent 55.8% and 35.8% of the total domestic government health costs of these countries.

Moreover, chronic kidney disease – even in its earliest stages – significantly increases the risk of developing cardiovascular disease. An additional aggravator of mounting healthcare costs and burdens associated with progressive disease are the modalities of kidney replacement therapies which encompass peritoneal dialysis and kidney transplantation, which are unavailable in many LLMICs. Relative to HICs, peritoneal dialysis on kidney transplantation availability represented an availability of 0.5 per million population (pmp) (23% of LLMICs) vs. 53.0 pmp (89% of HICs).

What is the Goal of Early Chronic Kidney Disease Detection?

The goals of early detection are to prevent the progression of chronic kidney disease and its associated complications, with subsequent improvements in patient outcomes and reductions in the impact of chronic kidney disease on healthcare resources.

The Rationale for Early Detection

The basis for implementing urgent action of chronic kidney disease is improved patient outcomes through the identification of high-risk groups, resulting in targeted therapy implementation which subsequently would reduce the incidence of adverse and costly effects such as progression to end-stage renal disease, cardiovascular events, and mortality.

Early detection of chronic kidney disease has a notable impact in developing countries where both dialysis and transplant facilities are severely limited; as such it is hoped to have an especially noticeable effect on curtailing progression to end-stage renal disease, with a general increase in overall population health due to the decreased development of comorbidities. In addition to these effects, drug safety and potential toxic outcomes are also improved with early identification of kidney dysfunction, with potential downstream savings accumulating for both healthcare institutions and individuals.

Indeed, increased costs associated with treating chronic kidney disease result from high rates of comorbidity-driven admission and extended hospital stays that are associated with chronic kidney disease progression. Therefore, the costs accumulated during the early stages of chronic kidney disease accumulate as the condition progresses to end-stage renal disease and continue to remain very high after. The combination of increased awareness of chronic kidney disease among healthcare professionals and its subsequent timely intervention will result in improved economic and clinical outcomes.

Relatively few studies have quantitatively outlined potential cost savings of cat strategies for improved outcomes. However, extrapolating from other screening programs implemented for a range of chronic conditions such as diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease, suggest that timely and rapid treatment is a compelling and impactful strategy.

How is Chronic Kidney Disease Diagnosed?

Chronic kidney disease is clinically defined as evidence of impaired function or damage to kidney structure and/or declined function, as characterized by a reduction of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) that is sustained for at least 3 months.

Demonstrating the Impact of Early Detection and Intervention

Due to this high cost of kidney replacement therapy, there is a growing need to prioritize preventative strategies to delay the inevitable progression to kidney failure, rather than expand therapeutic services. To affect this change, implementation of both cost-effective and efficient screening and early detection strategies, alongside treatment programs that are aimed at delaying progression to end-stage renal failure is necessary.

Several studies have demonstrated that this is a possibility; in a study conducted in Nepal, 3 years of treatment were initiated in 4471 out of 20,811 patients screened for chronic kidney disease who was found to have diabetes, proteinuria, hypertension, or impaired kidney function, experienced significant improvements in the chronic kidney disease. Patients were treated via low-cost antihypertensives, anti-diabetic medication, or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-i); 63% showed decreased to normal dipstick positive proteinuria, and 48% of those with mild to moderately impaired kidney function at baseline showed stabilization or improvement. This study highlights the impact of early disease detection and subsequent early intervention treatments for reducing or eliminating the progression of chronic kidney disease and associated cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

Early detection on screening programs is used in HICs more routinely to assess disease burden and initiate tools and programs to improve kidney health and subsequent progression to later-stage which require costly therapeutic interventions and improve cardiovascular outcomes. At present, these measures have demonstrated a lack of effectiveness as there is a lack of overall benefits and an absence of cost-effective proof.

Prevention being better than a cure is a widespread ideology in medicine, however, this notion is considered to be more effective if preventative strategies target subgroups identified to be at greater risk of harm. Screening and early detection of chronic kidney disease are believed to produce better health outcomes as both patients and caregivers can actively use tools and knowledge to decelerate progression to end-stages and improve outcomes. However, this intuitive assumption has not been realized, on is prompted ‘to screen or not to screen’ debate in the nephrology setting.

The consensus emerging from the conference on ‘early identification and interventions in CKD’ organized by Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) was that CKD screening coupled with risk stratification and treatment should be implemented in primary or community care settings for high-risk persons. In line with this, nephrology groups have developed guidelines for screening for chronic kidney disease which are specific to populations with differentiating strategies directed towards specific subgroups, recommended tests to use, and the frequency of testing necessary.

Consequences of Early Detection

Alongside detection of kidney function, additional investigations are also necessary to determine the etiology of kidney disease. Several patients may have identifiable causes of chronic kidney disease, such as hypertension, diabetes, or inherited kidney disease; however, subgroups do not and require further testing. Other ancillary data, such as urine protein extraction unnecessary before a diagnosis of chronic kidney disease can be made.

One of the most notable benefits of early detection is increased exposure to therapeutic interventions that either delay or ameliorate the probability of adverse outcomes. There are also benefits to early detection at earlier stages of the care cascade. Currently, there is no consensus on what is defined as a timely referral; however, early identification can contribute towards avoiding episodes of acute kidney injury and the build-up of nephrotoxins, therefore referring all patients to a nephrology clinic at the point of identification is deemed appropriate.

However, this can become overwhelming for healthcare systems, so guidelines typically restrict referral to nephrology clinics for patients who have an eGFR of <30ml/min. Referral to a nephrology clinic can facilitate an understanding of the etiology of the patient's chronic kidney disease, which has subsequent implications for treatment choices on prognosis. It may also facilitate strategies to delay progression.

The early identification of chronic kidney disease has numerous benefits including increasing the amount of time that patients can undergo therapy which has been proven to confer several benefits. This early exposure to treatment has several downstream effects; avoiding nephrotoxic effects of drugs and more invasive procedures such as contrast-based imaging comment which in turn improves patient safety; and, finally decreasing the risk of patients developing acute kidney injury episodes.

These improvements subsequently need to a reduction in the use of and improved health for chronic kidney disease patients.

However, there is already a burden of chronic kidney disease, currently at epidemic proportion, and expected to increase further in both developing and developed countries. Therefore, improvement in chronic kidney disease detection, as well as improved methods to project prognostic outcomes and improved treatment strategies are necessary. This is occurring against a backdrop of increasing incidence of comorbidities such as diabetes in the developing world, alongside exposure to drug therapies and infections, therefore the need to ensure early identification of chronic kidney disease at the earliest time point possible is imperative.

But by March, the resolutions often have been dropped. The pounds didn’t melt away as expected, and the gym shoes get kicked to the back of the closet.

While exercising may help people lose weight and maintain the weight loss, fitness experts say, people might overestimate how many calories they burn when they are working out, or they simply may not do enough to move the scale. That 30-minute cardio workout that left you sweaty and breathless may have felt like a grueling marathon, but it may have burned only 200 to 300 calories.

“That can be completely undone by consuming one donut in like, what, 60 seconds,” said Glenn Gaesser, a professor of exercise physiology at the College of Health Solutions at Arizona State University in Phoenix. “So we can undo with eating in a matter of minutes what it took us to burn that many calories over the course of many, many minutes, sometimes hours.”

Regular exercise offers many benefits beyond burning calories — so there are plenty of reasons to keep moving in the new year. “Research shows that exercise affects pretty much every cell in the body, not just our heart, not just our muscles, but it also affects all the other organs, as well,” Gaesser said. “Exercise is something that is vital for good health.”

We have found that exercise basically improves health outcomes largely independent of weight loss. Glenn Gaesser, Arizona State University, Phoenix

Among the benefits listed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are sharper thinking, less depression and anxiety, better sleep, help with weight management, stronger bones and muscles, and reduced risks of heart disease, stroke, diabetes and cancers of the breast, the colon and other organs.

To obtain “substantial health benefits,” federal health guidelines advise adults to do at least 150 to 300 minutes a week of moderate-intensity physical activity or 75 to 150 minutes a week of vigorous physical activity, or an equivalent combination.

Nina McCollum, 52, of Cleveland, said she began gaining weight after she had a baby at age 40. The weight gain accelerated more in the last few years, said McCollum, who mainly blamed menopause.

McCollum, who has been physically active throughout her life, didn’t find that exercise helped keep the extra pounds off. She now considers herself about 40 pounds overweight, but she’s as much of an exercise enthusiast as ever. She works out at home, doing calisthenics and weight training and running stairs. She also walks her dog, and on the weekends she goes for outdoor hikes.

“I don’t care anymore that I’m not like a stick figure,” she said. Instead, she is focused on staying fit, strong and flexible as she ages, keeping healthy and trying to ward off heart disease, which runs in her family.

Exercise to live longer

Gaesser said research shows that people who are overweight but exercise regularly, like McCollum, still reap many health benefits. “We have found that exercise basically improves health outcomes largely independent of weight loss,” he said.

Physical activity works on multiple mechanisms within the body, and that’s how it could potentially help prevent chronic conditions and therefore also prevent early deaths. Amanda Paluch, University of Massachusetts Amherst

He co-wrote an article published in iScience in October that reviewed multiple studies and compared weight loss to exercise for promoting longevity and improving people’s overall health.

While most of the data were based on observational studies and can’t be used to establish cause and effect, Gaesser said, the research suggests that intentional weight loss is associated with a reduction in mortality risk of 10 percent to 15 percent. By comparison, studies suggest that increasing physical activity or improving fitness is associated with a reduction in mortality risk in the range of 15 percent to 60 percent.

“The major take-home message is that just being physically active and trying to improve your fitness seems to provide better prospects for longevity than just trying to lose weight,” he said.

Another study published last year also found that exercise promotes longevity — even walking significantly fewer than the often recommended 10,000 steps. Middle-age people who walked at least 7,000 steps a day on average were about 50 percent to 70 percent less likely to die of cancer, heart disease or other causes over the next decade than those who walked less, according to results in JAMA Open Network.

“Physical activity works on multiple mechanisms within the body, and that’s how it could potentially help prevent chronic conditions and therefore also prevent early deaths,” said the study’s author, Amanda Paluch, an assistant professor of kinesiology at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

Dr. Robert Sallis has long viewed exercise as a critical part of a healthy lifestyle. As president of the American College of Sports Medicine from 2007 to 2008, he inspired the “Exercise is Medicine” campaign, which encourages physicians to talk to patients about their physical activity, even to “prescribe” it.

Sedentary people who get moving can start feeling better right away, said Sallis, a clinical professor of family medicine at the University of California, Riverside, School of Medicine and the director of the sports medicine fellowship at Kaiser Permanente in Fontana.

“The first thing is mental health. That is almost the first thing people notice — I feel better, I have more energy, I sleep better,” he said. “But then you could just go down the list of chronic diseases. I couldn’t tell you a disease that isn’t helped by it, from diabetes to heart disease to blood pressure to cholesterol to cancer, on and on.”

Sallis encourages patients who don't exercise to start small and try to work up to the federal guidelines.

""The curve is very steep in terms of the benefits,” he said. “Doing just a little bit gives tremendous benefits. So I try to focus on those smaller pieces instead of feeling like you have to join a gym and you have to do all this. Just go out and walk.""

He also encourages patients to keep going even if they aren’t losing weight. Too often, there is “this singular focus on their weight and thinking that, you know, if I don’t lose weight, the exercise was not helpful to me, and a lot of them use that as a reason to stop,” he said. “But the weight has so little to do with the benefits. If you can get patients who are overweight to be active, they get the same health benefits.”

And being thin doesn’t mean you don’t need to exercise.

“In fact, if you’re at a normal weight and you aren’t physically active, you’re putting yourself at risk for a lot of conditions,” Sallis said.","While exercising may help people lose weight and maintain the weight loss, fitness experts say, people might overestimate how many calories they burn when they are working out, or they simply may not do enough to move the scale.

The attorney, Manny Arora, said he had not been able to contact Sorokin, 31, Monday afternoon.

""Legally, they should not be able to deport her until the 19th. That is due to the deportation order being signed on February 17 and that allows us to have 30 days to file an appeal,"" Arora said in a statement. ""But we are dealing with bureaucracy, and there are numerous filings in her case so you just never know if there was a paperwork error. I haven't heard from Miss Sorokin this afternoon, and so I am working under the presumption that she is being deported.""

ICE did not respond to a request for comment.

Sorokin, the subject of the Netflix series ""Inventing Anna,"" served about four years in prison after she was found guilty of swindling and attempting to swindle banks and hotels out of hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Sorokin falsely claimed to be a German heiress named Anna Delvey who had a $60 million inheritance and was raising funds to launch a Manhattan social club. She swindled hundreds of thousands of dollars from friends, banks and New York City luxury hotels to float her lavish lifestyle.

She was released on parole more than a year ago but six weeks later was taken into custody for overstaying her visa. Sorokin appealed to stay in the U.S. and was scheduled for a hearing April 19.

Sorokin was recently part of a class-action lawsuit against ICE for refusing to give Covid vaccines to inmates. In the lawsuit, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, she said she contracted Covid-19 after she was denied multiple requests for a booster shot.

Sorokin's ascent into New York City's wealthy social scene and her crimes were popularized by 2018 profile in The Cut, which inspired the Netflix series. Netflix paid Sorokin $320,000, and she served as a consultant for the Shonda Rhimes-produced show.

She told a New York Times reporter that she is not so ""brazen and shameless"" as the show portrayed her to be.

""I don't think, like, I order people around as much,"" Sorokin told reporter Emily Palmer in a video posted on TikTok.

Sorokin's best friend, Neffatari Davis, who also worked on ""Inventing Anna"" and was a character in the show, told the New York Post that Sorokin has paid her dues.

“She got out on good behavior and she used the money Netflix gave her to pay everybody back. She owes no money,” Davis said. “She’s paid for her crimes. She didn’t kill anyone. She did wrong, but, at the end of the day, there are people who have done worse.”","The attorney, Manny Arora, said he had not been able to contact Sorokin, 31, Monday afternoon.

About one third of adults with diabetes has chronic kidney disease, making early detection and treatment of CKD important for improving health outcomes. However, many won’t know they have the disease until it has progressed.

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) is partnering with the diagnostics company Renalytix to develop a diabetes kidney care pathway and model to encourage early detection, improve treatment and reduce risk.

El Sayed is an instructor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and vice president of health care improvement at the American Diabetes Association.

In an interview with Healio, Nuha El Sayed, MD, MMSc, instructor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and vice president of health care improvement at ADA, discussed the connection between diabetes and kidney disease and the benefits of early detection.

Healio: What is the connection between diabetes and kidney disease? How important is CKD detection and management in treating the growing population of people with diabetes?

El Sayed: Diabetes is the leading cause for kidney failure in the U.S. It is the primary cause of kidney failure in so many of those individuals. Typically, kidney disease has no symptoms until it is very far advanced. That is why it is critically important to screen for early disease, at which point one can do a great deal to prevent progression of kidney disease.

In the U.S., we know that screening rates are relatively low, and there is a huge opportunity for improvement. The American Diabetes Association is working closely with other organizations to change this.

Healio: Does CKD in people with diabetes often go undetected?

El Sayed: Most people with kidney disease do not know they have it. Sadly, there are numerous examples of people going to an emergency room feeling ill and at that moment being informed that they have kidney failure related to diabetes and require dialysis. Meanwhile, this disease process had gone on for years, unrecognized.

Healio: What are some of the benefits of early detection of CKD for people with diabetes?

El Sayed: Early recognition of kidney disease allows for treatment to prevent any further loss. The good news is that people have a good amount of extra kidney function, and if one can detect some loss of kidney function early, there are a number of steps that one can do to slow down the process. Controlling blood glucose and blood pressure are the most important ones, and there are medications that can specifically protect the kidneys, like ACE inhibitors and SGLT2 inhibitors.

Healio: How does the development of new treatments and screening techniques affect the trajectory of those diagnosed with diabetic kidney disease?

El Sayed: The number of adults with diagnosed diabetes is expected to reach 60 million by 2060 in the United States alone, with up to 40% expected to develop chronic kidney disease. Chronic kidney disease is a silent disease, that each year kills more people than breast and prostate cancer alone. We must identify new avenues in terms of therapeutic strategies and early detection.

Healio: Could you tell me more about the details of the comprehensive diabetes kidney care pathway and model? What are the goals for creating this model?

El Sayed: The comprehensive diabetes kidney care pathway and model is aimed at tackling the issues described above. It will help guide clinicians on how to best manage and prevent the progression of chronic kidney disease and understand the importance of early detection and will also engage with people with diabetes to raise their awareness and empower them to protect their kidneys and thrive.","SaveEarly detection key to preventing chronic kidney disease for adults with diabetesBy Lisa Holden Source/Disclosures Published by: Source: Healio interview Disclosures: El Sayed reports no relevant financial disclosures.

How do tennis rankings work?

Tennis world rankings are calculated by the ATP, who award points based on a player's performance at particular tournaments.

The further a player progresses in a sanctioned event, the more points they will be awarded.

Grand slams provide the most points with 2000 awarded to the winner and 1200 to the runner-up.

Points picked up from each tournament last for one year with rankings updated each week.

When are tennis rankings updated?

Both the ATP and WTA update their rankings every Monday when tournaments aren't running.

So in general you can expect weekly updates aside from when Grand Slams are being competed.","The mantle of world No.1 in tennis is something every player aspires for but few ever achieve.

524,524,https://www.dawn.com/news/1679329,"Lumpy skin disease not transmittable to humans, says AKUH alert","KARACHI: After weeks of anxiety and fear among people, mainly in urban centres of Sindh, over growing number of lumpy skin disease in cattle, the Aga Khan University Hospital — one of the leading health science institutions — on Thursday declared that the infection “doesn’t cause human disease”.

In an alert, the institution concluded that consuming the meat and milk of infected cattle “doesn’t transmit the infections to humans”.

Titled “Emerging Infection Alert: Lumpy Skin Disease”, the alert by the institution called for food safety and all due precautions, advising consumption of only pasteurised or well-boiled milk, and its byproducts and well-cooked meat.

The AKUH department of infection prevention and hospital epidemiology came up with details of its findings about the subject infection referring to its “Aetiology Epidemiology Diagnosis Prevention and Control References”.

Finding may help neutralise alarm in public, bring down poultry prices

In a brief supplemented by the alert and reference, the AKUH shared key points of its findings with title of each area of its impact. While sharing the cause of its spread, it said that it was possibly caused by biting of insects and through contact with secretion, lesion and fomites. The most relevant part of the alert for consumers was shared under the title “Threat to Human”, under which the institution answered almost every crucial question. “Minimal to none,” said the first point of the alert.

“Human disease has not been well documented. Consuming meat or milk doesn’t transmit the infection to human,” it said. However, it added, in order to prevent other infections, food safety should be ensured which included consumption of only pasteurised or well-boiled milk and milk products, thorough cooking of meat, and proper washing of hands with soap and water after handling meat.

Earlier in the opening of its alert, the AKUH made it clear: “this is an infection of cattle and does not cause human disease.”

Only a couple of days ago, the Sindh livestock department had shared the figure which suggested that as many as 54 animals had died due to the Lumpy Skin Disease that has so far infected over 20,000 animals, including 15,100 in Karachi alone, across the province. The department found that the infection had appeared in animals in Punjab and Sindh.

The disease, it said, had so far been found in 20,250 animals in the province, including 15,100 in Karachi, 3,781 in Thatta, 149 in Hyderabad, 656 in Badin, 85 in Jamshoro, 121 in Khairpur, 91 in Sujawal, 64 in Matiari, 35 in Shaheed Benazirabad, 124 in Sanghar, 36 in Thana Bula Khan, four in Qambar-Shahdadkot and two each in Tando Muhammad Khan and Dadu.

Following reports of growing number of the cases among the cattle, a large number of citizens started avoiding meat of cow and veal, lifting the demand of poultry meat which has witnessed staggering increase. The prices of live bird in the city and its clean meat have jumped to an alarming high of Rs330-336 per kg, and Rs570 per kg, respectively. In the first week of February, live bird was available at Rs190-210 per kg, while the meat was sold at Rs350-380.

For the last two years, the Karachi commissioner has kept the price of live bird and its meat unchanged at Rs138 per kg and Rs214 per kg, respectively, in the official price list. The officials concerned have failed to enforce the official price list. Retailers, however, do not display the official rates at their shops, and demand different prices in various areas.

They quickly took their courtship to WhatsApp and bonded over their shared difficulty in love: He told her his wife had died of cancer. She told him her first husband had also died and she'd recently found out her second husband was cheating on her.

""[He] WhatsApped me every day, so nicely talking,"" said Browne.

""I fell for him.""

Less than a year later, Browne says the man she thought she was building a life with had scammed her out of about $26,000 in a type of scheme the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre says is on the rise.

In a statement, Toronto police confirmed they're investigating, and said ""unfortunately, this type of crime isn't uncommon.""

'Drastic' increase in romance scams

Jeff Horncastle, a unit supervisor with the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre, agreed.

""It's a story that we hear far, far too often,"" said Horncastle, who noted that romance scams have seen a ""drastic"" increase in recent years.

In 2020, the fraud centre registered a reported loss of nearly $28 million due to romance scams in Canada. In 2021, that number more than doubled to more than $64 million – though Horncastle believes that may be an underestimate, as people are often reluctant to report this type of crime. Last year, romance scams accounted for the second-highest amount of dollars lost to fraud in Canada, the centre said.

Horncastle said some warning signs that could point to a potential scam include:

A social media or dating profile that seems too good to be true.

If the person confesses their love quickly, without having met in person.

They want to quickly move to a private form of communication, like email or text.

They always have excuses why they can't meet up in person.

They encourage you to avoid talking about your relationship with friends or family.

Their messages are poorly written, or if they call you by the wrong name.

Browne says she and the fraudster often spoke on WhatsApp and she felt like she trusted him. (Patrick Sison/The Associated Press)

Browne's purported sweetheart called himself Fabian, and said he was a pilot based in Jordan. About two months after they started chatting, he asked for her clothing size and said he planned to send gifts from his travels in Europe.

Fabian told her she'd have to pay a fee to have the gifts delivered.

""I thought maybe the fee was going to cost me, about $30 or $20 or $100 or something,"" she said.

But when she got a call from someone who claimed to work for a courier company holding the gifts, Browne was told the fee would cost $1,500.

When she asked Fabian about this, he told her that there was $150,000 inside the gift.

Shocked, Browne asked him why and said he told her he'd ""fallen in love with me and then we're going to settle down in Canada.""

Browne was uncertain. Still, she did as she was told and sent the $1,500 using a nearby BitCoin ATM.

But it didn't end there. The company kept asking for more money – and threatening legal trouble if she didn't pay up. She even dipped into funds she'd been saving to fly to Singapore to visit her mother's grave.

Horncastle noted that scammers aren't amateurs; they will put a lot of care into constructing a persona their victims will find appealing.

""These criminals unfortunately know exactly what these people want to hear,"" he said.

""They know how to manipulate them, they know how to play with their emotions, and unfortunately, that's why they're able to get so much money out of these victims.""

'I never thought that wasn't real'

At one point, Browne said she asked Fabian why he didn't pay the fee since he was a pilot.

""Fabian told me: because Qatar airlines hold his account,"" she said. ""And then I just never [thought] that wasn't real.""

Eventually, Browne had cleared out her savings, and was considering selling her car to get more cash.

The situation finally came to an end when Browne, who manages a car wash, was visibly distraught at work. A police officer who was a regular customer asked her what was wrong, and when she described the situation, he urged her to report it.

""The officer called me five days later and then they said, 'You've been scammed,'"" she said.

'Be careful'

At the time, Browne didn't confide to friends or family about what was going on.

Now, she wants to share her story to warn others about the risk of romance scams.

""Just be careful when you don't know the person, you never meet them and they start fall[ing] in love with you,"" she said.

When it comes to protecting yourself online, Horncastle said:

Be cautious about what personal information you share.

Avoid sharing intimate photos online.

Don't accept friend requests from people you don't know.

Don't invest money in platforms provided by people you don't know.

Above all, Horncastle said, don't ever send money to someone you haven't met. Browne agreed.

In the 13-second clip posted on Friday on Facebook, she bares the left side of her chest in a black bodysuit and shows off her new figure while dancing confidently.

Her goal? To send a message to breast cancer patients that women are beautiful even after having a mastectomy and that they can come out of the experience stronger than before.

She had hesitated about posting the video for some time as she was worried about haters leaving mean comments, but she went ahead believing it could help empower someone in a similar situation.

She told The Straits Times: “I’d seen pictures of women in the West who show their scars and chests openly. I wanted women in this part of the world to know – you are seen, you are represented, your story is being told.”

Ms Alphonso, who is an editor at OCBC Bank and a yoga instructor, was diagnosed with breast cancer in November 2022.

Her doctor had assessed the cancer to be at stage three, based on the size of the tumour. But tests done after her breast was removed later revealed that she had stage one cancer.

The former journalist first shared her cancer journey on social community website whatareyoudoing.sg, saying that the possibility of death had plagued her initially, but she quickly made the choice to fight for her life.

“This meant doing whatever was necessary to stay alive and putting my heart and soul into actual living. I needed to be happy, no matter what might come,” she said.","SINGAPORE – Two months after surgically removing one of her breasts due to cancer, Ms Jill Alphonso, 44, proudly displays her scars in a video on social media.

A previously healthy and fully vaccinated 3-year-old girl was brought to our emergency department (ED) with a 7-day history of daily fever (up to 40 °C, axillary), a rash on her face and extremities, peeling of the soles of her feet, and intermittent nonbloody, nonbilious emesis.

History. The patient’s mother denied the patient had cough, congestion, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, diarrhea, swelling of hands and feet, mucous membrane changes, conjunctival injection, or dysuria. There had been no recent travel, sick contacts, or known exposure to COVID-19. The patient lived in Houston, Texas, with her mother and did not attend daycare. There was no history of pets or animal exposures.

The patient had been initially evaluated at an outside hospital, where she had a normal white blood cell count, a low platelet count, a mildly low hemoglobin level, an elevated liver enzyme level, an elevated D-dimer level, an elevated lactic dehydrogenase level, an elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) level, and an elevated ferritin level. Results of basic blood chemistry panels, a urinalysis, and tests for troponin and brain natriuretic peptide were within normal limits. Results of a respiratory viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) panel, monospot test, and rapid streptococcal antigen test were negative, and a chest radiograph was unremarkable. Blood and urine cultures were collected and sent for evaluation. The patient was transferred to our ED for further evaluation and management.

Physical examination. Upon arrival to our ED, the patient was febrile with a temperature of 40.5 °C (axillary), irritable, and tachycardic but nontoxic appearing. She had mild conjunctival injection without drainage; a macular, erythematous rash on her face and extremities; a rash involving the soles of her feet with mild desquamation; and a faint petechial rash over the abdomen. She had no lymphadenopathy and no palpable hepatosplenomegaly. The remainder of her physical examination was unremarkable.

Diagnostic testing. Given the broad differential diagnosis—especially during the COVID-19 pandemic—an infectious disease specialist, rheumatologist, and cardiologist were consulted. The differential diagnosis included COVID-19, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) triggered by SARS-CoV-2, and incomplete Kawasaki disease. Other infectious etiologies such as occult bacteremia, evolving toxic shock syndrome, viral sepsis (ie, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, adenovirus, parvovirus), rickettsial illness, and ehrlichiosis were also considered.

Repeat blood and urine cultures were collected. Intravenous doxycycline, 2.2 mg/kg every 12 hours was empirically started for suspected murine typhus due to endemicity in the Houston area. Results of a SARS-CoV-2 PCR test were negative, and a SARS-CoV-2 antibody titer was nonreactive. An echocardiography scan was conducted for suspicion for Kawasaki disease and MIS-C, results of which showed normal function and trivial mitral regurgitation without coronary artery dilatation.

On hospital day 2, the patient continued to be febrile (day 9 of fever). A repeat echocardiography scan was conducted but results of which were unchanged. Empiric intravenous ceftriaxone, 50 mg/kg every 24 hours was added while results of the blood and urine cultures were pending. After a multidisciplinary discussion on hospital day 3, it was determined that the patient met criteria for incomplete Kawasaki disease, thus intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), 2 g/kg and aspirin, 5.5 mg/kg/d were started.

The blood culture obtained on hospital day 1 returned positive results for Gram-negative rods, and the urine culture grew Escherichia coli. Given her persistent fever (day 10 of fever) and bacteremia due to gram-negative bacilli, antibiotic coverage was broadened to intravenous cefepime, 50 mg/kg every 8 hours, and ceftriaxone was discontinued. Doxycycline was discontinued once Rickettsia typhi and Ehrlichia chaffeensis tests returned negative results. Later that day, the patient developed decreased urine output and hyponatremia. She was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit with concerns for syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion. A computed tomography scan of the head was unremarkable, and a complete abdominal ultrasonography scan showed mild splenomegaly.

On hospital day 4, repeat laboratory evaluation was significant for leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, an elevated CRP level, and hyponatremia. Further laboratory parameters revealed hypertriglyceridemia, an elevated ferritin level, a low fibrinogen level, and an elevated soluble interleukin 2 receptor level, which led to suspicion for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). A hematologist was consulted, and a presumptive diagnosis of HLH was considered since the patient had 5 out of 8 criteria (Table 1).

Evaluations for acute infections caused by Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, parvovirus, influenza, parainfluenza 1 to 4, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, and arboviruses returned negative results. On hospital day 5, the pathogen causing the patient’s bacteremia was identified as Brucella melitensis. Brucella antibodies by agglutination were added to the pre-IVIG serum with a titer of 1:40 (reference range, < 1:20). Once the diagnosis of brucellosis was established, oral rifampin, 10 mg/kg every 24 hours and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 5 mg/kg every 12 hours was started, and cefepime was discontinued. Subsequently, the patient improved rapidly. Upon further questioning, the patient’s family reported consuming store-bought queso fresco (ie, semisoft fresh cheese) but denied consuming unpasteurized milk or cheese.

Patient outcome. At the time of discharge, the patient was afebrile, her conjunctival injection and rash had resolved, and abnormal laboratory parameters were improving. She was discharged home on hospital day 7 to complete a 6-week course of rifampin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, as well as aspirin. The results of the blood culture from the outside hospital, which returned after the patient’s discharge, also grew Brucella melitensis.

The patient followed up with the infectious disease specialist 2 weeks after discharge and was doing well without any complications. A repeat echocardiography scan at 6 weeks post-discharge was unremarkable, and aspirin was discontinued after clearance from a cardiologist. She also followed up with the hematologist, and repeat ferritin, triglyceride, and complete blood cell count tests returned results within the normal range. She completed a course of antibiotics and has had a full recovery.

Discussion. Brucellosis is a bacterial zoonosis caused by Brucella species, which is an encapsulated Gram-negative coccobacillus. Humans become infected most commonly through consumption of unpasteurized milk or milk products, as well as direct contact with infected animals or aerosol inhalation. It is uncommon in developed countries, and in the United States, 100 to 200 cases of human brucellosis are reported annually.1 The most common clinical manifestations of brucellosis include fever, fatigue, weight loss, diaphoresis, arthralgia, and myalgia. Complications include spondylitis (most commonly of the lumbar vertebra), genitourinary involvement in boys and men, neurobrucellosis, and endocarditis. Laboratory abnormalities include anemia, thrombocytopenia, or pancytopenia, as well as elevated liver enzyme levels. The diagnosis is established either by positive culture (eg, blood, bone marrow, cerebrospinal fluid, or other bodily fluid) or detection of specific antibodies or nucleic amplification detection plus compatible clinical picture.2 Of note serologic tests should not be used alone for diagnosis because of crossreactivity with other bacteria, false-negative results in some cases, and persistently positive results even after treatment.3 In children, treatment duration is 6 to 8 weeks and includes doxycycline plus rifampin in children older than 8 years or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole plus rifampin in children younger than 8 years.2

HLH is a rare disease, which usually occurs in infants and children. According to the Histocyte Society HLH-2004 study, the diagnosis is made if 5 of 8 criteria are fulfilled (Table 1).4 Historically, HLH has been categorized as primary (hereditary) or secondary (triggered by autoimmune diseases, malignancy, or infection).5 The most common infections causing secondary HLH are viral infections, namely Epstein-Barr virus. HLH-specific therapy is aimed at decreasing hyperinflammation with dexamethasone and etoposide.4,5 Other reported treatments include IVIG, plasma exchange, and anakinra.5

There has been discussion in the literature about reconceptualizing HLH to aid in the decision-making process as well as in prompt initiation of HLH-directed therapies. One proposal is the use of the umbrella term “HLH syndrome” for conditions meeting diagnostic criteria. The umbrella term would include:6

HLH disease: Patients who would benefit from HLH-specific therapies

HLH disease mimics: Patients in whom distinctive immune dysregulation is not the core problem and thus would not benefit from immune suppression but rather treatment of the underlying condition

A PubMed search and review of case reports of pediatric brucellosis and HLH in the literature mainly occur in areas of the world where brucella is endemic or in patients who recently visited such areas (Table 2).7-17 Many of these patients underwent invasive procedures (such as bone marrow biopsy) to complete HLH evaluation, and some received HLH-directed treatment, despite most patients improving quickly on antibiotics alone. We believe that in those cases where brucella and HLH disease mimics are suspected, a cautious approach should be taken, and invasive procedures and HLH-directed treatment should be deferred if the patient remains stable.

A challenging aspect of the diagnosis is the slow-growing nature of brucella, leading to a delay in diagnosis, especially in regions of low endemicity. Another challenge is when to suspect HLH disease mimics vs HLH disease. A retrospective study conducted at our institution investigated hyperferritinemia and HLH and revealed that a ferritin level of more than 10,000 µg/L was 90% sensitive and 96% specific for HLH disease.18 In that study, 330 patients had ferritin levels higher than 500 µg/L. Of the 330 patients, 10 were diagnosed with HLH disease and had a median ferritin level of 5992 µg/L (range, 757-63,919 µg/L). Interestingly, 43 patients had bacterial infections and had a median ferritin level of 943 µg/L (range, 523-7508 µg/L). We propose that it is reasonable to suspect HLH disease mimics and to avoid unnecessary invasive procedures and treatments in individuals with modest increases in ferritin level and in whom there is suspicion for an infectious etiology if they are clinically stable.

Our patient would best fit into the category of HLH disease mimics due to brucellosis. It is possible that treatment with IVIG could have modified her course somewhat, but she recovered without undergoing any invasive procedures or HLH-directed therapy. Also, our patient’s ferritin level was 1390 µg/L on presentation, which correlates with the median range for ferritin levels in patients with a bacterial infection in the study performed at our institution.18 More prospective studies are needed to better elucidate the difference between HLH disease and HLH disease mimics to direct appropriate management and therapy as promptly as possible.

In a patient like ours who presents with fever, rash, transaminitis, hepatosplenomegaly, and cytopenias, it is important to initiate a systematic approach to ruling out other diseases such as Kawasaki disease, viral infections, rickettsial diseases, bacterial infections, malignancies, and rheumatological processes including MIS-C. HLH disease mimics should also be in the differential diagnosis while awaiting diagnostic tests.

Conclusions. Brucellosis is a bacterial zoonotic disease that can lead to HLH disease mimics. A careful history, physical examination, and a thorough laboratory evaluation would enable physicians to diagnose this disease. Lack of exposure to unpasteurized milk products or farm animals should not dissuade a clinician from suspecting brucellosis. Prompt initiation of antibiotics is important for early recovery and avoidance of further invasive procedures and unwarranted HLH-directed therapy.","Further laboratory parameters revealed hypertriglyceridemia, an elevated ferritin level, a low fibrinogen level, and an elevated soluble interleukin 2 receptor level, which led to suspicion for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH).

Mr Kwek Hong Lim had demanded S$15 million (US$11.3 million) for his ""amicable exit"" from the company that ran YES Supermarket in Tampines and later threatened to publicise the family dispute.

His father Kwek Sum Chuan, who founded the company, said there was no such verbal agreement. When they could not agree on the terms of his son's exit, the younger man launched a legal suit.

The older man said his son had “seriously mismanaged the company” and that it incurred significant financial losses as a result. The supermarket, located at Block 201B Tampines Street 21, ceased operations in 2018.

The High Court dismissed the lawsuit on Thursday (Mar 23).

Justice Hoo Sheau Peng said: “Having observed the plaintiff (the son) and having considered his evidence against the surrounding facts and circumstances, I do not find the plaintiff a credible witness.

“The plaintiff has shown a tendency to exaggerate facts.”

She added that the younger man, who has a master’s degree and was an experienced businessman, never put the agreement into writing.

“Although he says he asked the defendant many times to put the agreement into writing, those were all verbal requests,” said the judge.

“Even if the defendant had refused to do so, the plaintiff could have followed up with a written request. There was none.”

THE DISPUTE

The company was set up in 1999 by the father, who owns 85 per cent of the supermarket business. His son, Mr Kwek Hong Lim, owned 8 per cent.

The remaining 7 per cent was split between the defendant’s wife (5 per cent) and his daughter (2 per cent).

In 2003, the property in Tampines was bought by one of the father’s companies.

The son told the court he was appointed CEO in 2004, and he claimed that the business boomed under him.

The defendant, however, said his son was “not substantively involved” in setting up the company, and that he saw it as a family business and wanted his five children to be involved in it.

His son only started working in the company in 2003 after getting his master’s degree. In 2004, the father agreed to make his son CEO as he “wanted to groom” his son to take over.

According to the son, he was headhunted by a Malaysian company for the position of CEO, and was offered an annual remuneration of between RM900,000 (S$272,000) and RM1.2 million.

But he claimed he turned it down when the father verbally offered him another 60 per cent shares in the company and 60 per cent of the properties – something the older man disputes.

“On the other hand, the defendant (father) denies having ever made such an offer to the plaintiff or having entered into the alleged oral agreement with the plaintiff,” Justice Hoo said in her judgment.

“The defendant says he did not receive any resignation letter from the plaintiff and did not receive any indication that the plaintiff wished to resign.”

According to the father, he decided in 2012 that his children should play a larger role in the company, and appointed his daughter and his son as directors of the company at the same time.

He said he intended to distribute his assets to his children, including his son, in the future.

The court heard that the son had asked his father to put matters into writing, but the older man said he thought it was unnecessary and that he was simply expressing his plans for the future and did not intend to create any legally binding agreement.

One such discussion was on Dec 21, 2015, which was captured on video. The son used it to substantiate his case.

By 2017, the supermarket business ceased to be viable, and on May 25, 2018, the father and other shareholders of the company unanimously resolved to end the supermarket operations.

THREATS AND DEMANDS

According to the older man, from 2016, his son made a series of threats and demands against him for his money and assets.

The relationship deteriorated significantly by March 2018, when the father was in the midst of closing the company’s supermarket operations.

He offered his son S$3 million to buy out his 8 per cent of shares and hoped his son would obtain the necessary documents for the closure.

But his son asked for S$15 million instead to exit the company. This was rejected by his father.

In an email on May 30, 2018, the son threatened to open legal proceedings against his father. On the same day, he sent another email that the father understood to be a threat to publicise the family dispute in the newspapers.

Fearing the threats, the father met his son the next day. He was shown a draft agreement in which his son was prepared to agree to the S$3 million for the shares, but they could not agree on the other terms.

About a week later, Shin Min News ran an article about the family’s feud, including the son’s allegations of the existence of a verbal agreement with his father.

The older man said he only found out about this verbal agreement after reading the article, and that he did not respond to the press because he did not want to make public the family feud.

Both sides met in June 2019 but could not resolve their differences. Slightly more than a year later, the son sued his father.

UNRELIABLE VIDEO RECORDING

The court heard that there were no witnesses to the meeting between the father and son when the alleged verbal agreement was made.

He also failed to call on any officer from the Malaysian company that had purportedly offered him a job to verify the offer letter. He did not even attempt to contact the people who made the offer to him, or any other relevant witnesses, the judge said.

Regarding the video recording in 2015, the son claimed it showed his father confirming the existence of the verbal agreement.

The judge noted that the video recording submitted to the court was only about 4 minutes and 38 seconds long – when the entire meeting was about two hours.

During the cross-examination, the son claimed that he had asked the person who retrieved the video to “truncate a relevant portion of the video recording”.

He claimed he did not receive the entire video recording, something the person who retrieved the video disputed.

The judge also said there was a “serious mismatch” between the audio and video feeds of the recording.

“For instance, during a portion of the video recording, multiple bouts of coughing were heard, but persons in the video were not seen coughing,” said the judge, adding that the son provided no explanation for the mismatch.

She said there were “serious lingering doubts” about the video’s authenticity and that it was only a small portion of the meeting.

Because the conversation was in Teochew – a commonly spoken Chinese dialect in Singapore – the son asked a Mr Yeo to help with the translation.

She noted that Mr Yeo’s translation was disputed by the father, and the judge highlighted Mr Yeo’s lack of expertise in translation.

The court was told that the son was unable to find a certified Teochew translator.

“I am not satisfied with the bald assertion that the plaintiff could not find a translator in Teochew in Singapore,” said the judge.

A professional translator engaged by the father observed the poor quality of the video and from what he could hear, provided a “vastly different transcript” from Mr Yeo’s.

The judge also said it was “entirely self serving” for the son to rely on the Shin Min article to establish the existence of the verbal agreement, given that it was “based entirely” on the son’s version of events.

She noted the son had no other personal written record of the verbal agreement, and in his letter and emails to his father, he did not mention this agreement.

“At the end of the day, it would have been reasonable to expect some form of documentation on the part of the plaintiff,” said the High Court judge.

“However, as discussed above, there is nothing that points to the existence of the alleged oral agreement. The video recording was meant to be the strongest piece of objective evidence to capture the alleged oral agreement, but it failed dismally to do so.”

She accepted that the father merely discussed succession plans with his son, including giving away assets to his five children in future.","SINGAPORE: A man who sued his father over a failed supermarket business, claiming he was verbally promised a larger share of the company and property, had his case dismissed by the High Court.
His father Kwek Sum Chuan, who founded the company, said there was no such verbal agreement.
The older man said his son had “seriously mismanaged the company” and that it incurred significant financial losses as a result.

Although optimized medical therapies have been developed for heart failure during the last few decades, some patients with cardiomyopathy exhibit advanced heart failure and are refractory to medical therapies. Desmosome, which is a dynamic cell-to-cell junctional component, maintains the structural integrity of heart tissues. Genetic mutations in desmosomal genes cause arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (AC), a rare inheritable disease, and predispose patients to sudden cardiac death and heart failure. Recent advances in sequencing technologies have elucidated the genetic basis of cardiomyopathies and revealed that desmosome-related cardiomyopathy is concealed in broad cardiomyopathies. Among desmosomal genes, mutations in PKP2 (which encodes PKP2) are most frequently identified in patients with AC. PKP2 deficiency causes various pathological cardiac phenotypes. Human cardiomyocytes differentiated from patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) in combination with genome editing, which allows the precise arrangement of the targeted genome, are powerful experimental tools for studying disease.

Researchers, however, have found that the human eye can show early signals of this common form of dementia long before symptoms become apparent.

Researchers at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California, led the study, which was published in the journal Acta Neuropathologica last month.

The researchers analyzed human eyes and brain tissue from 86 deceased patients who had been diagnosed with either Alzheimer’s disease or mild cognitive impairment before they died.

ALZHEIMER’S DIAGNOSES EXPECTED TO REACH NEARLY 13 MILLION BY 2050, SAYS NEW REPORT

The researchers also compared samples from people who had normal cognitive function to those who had early-stage symptoms and to those who had late-stage Alzheimer’s.

The retinas of the patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease, the researchers found, had an excess amount of amyloid beta 42, a protein that forms the ""plaques"" that build up in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s.

Researchers have found that the human eye can show early signals of Alzheimer's long before symptoms become apparent.

Additionally, the retinas contained cells called microglia, which are also associated with progression of the disease.

""We discovered the accumulation of highly toxic proteins in the retinas of patients with Alzheimer’s disease and mild cognitive impairment, causing severe degeneration of cells,"" said Dr. Yosef Koronyo, research associate in the Cedars-Sinai Department of Neurosurgery and first author of the study, in a statement on the Cedars-Sinai website.

WHAT IS FRONTOTEMPORAL DEMENTIA, THE DIAGNOSIS BRUCE WILLIS HAS RECEIVED?

The changes were also detected in patients who did not display any cognitive decline or had only very mild signs, indicating that retinal tests could help enable early diagnosis.

Dr. Shaheen Lakhan, a Boston-based neurologist with a specialized focus on dementia, said the eyes long have been considered an extension of the brain in the medical community.

Story continues

He was not involved in the study.

""Over the years, we have learned that eye health is a mirror of brain health,"" he told Fox News Digital in an email.

""We can see early signs of the effects of diabetes and high blood pressure on nerves and blood vessels in the eye. The thickness of eye layers can now help diagnose multiple sclerosis.""

He went on, ""And now we can add Alzheimer’s to the list, as the same plaques seen in brain tissue are found in the retina.""

This study is the most comprehensive analysis of the human retina in terms of how it relates to the brains and cognitive functions of Alzheimer’s patients.

That's according to Maya Koronyo-Hamaoui, PhD, professor of neurosurgery, neurology and biomedical sciences at Cedars-Sinai, in a statement.

""These findings may eventually lead to the development of imaging techniques that allow us to diagnose Alzheimer’s disease earlier and more accurately, and monitor its progression non-invasively by looking through the eye,"" said the senior author of a new study.

FIRST DRUG PROVEN TO SLOW ALZHEIMER'S WON'T BE AVAILABLE TO MOST PATIENTS FOR SEVERAL MONTHS

In the not-so-distant future, Dr. Lakhan expects that patients will be able to get a retinal scan that will provide a ""brain fingerprint"" flagging any early signs of diseases like dementia and MS, well before symptoms begin.

Experts agree, though, that more research is needed to better understand the link between Alzheimer's and the retina.

The study authors say this is the most comprehensive analysis of the human retina in terms of how it relates to the brains and cognitive functions of Alzheimer’s patients.

""Our eyes may well be windows that allow us to peek into our brains, but this method is not yet ready for prime time,"" Dr. Gary Small, chair of psychiatry at Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey, told Fox News Digital via email.

BEIJING (AP) — A Ukrainian skeleton athlete flashed a small sign that read “ No War in Ukraine ” to the cameras as he finished a run at the Beijing Olympics on Friday night, a plea for peace at a time of rising tensions between his country and Russia.

Vladyslav Heraskevych’s sign was printed on a blue-and-yellow piece of paper, matching the colors of his country’s flag. He did not display the message after his second run of the night, which was his fourth and final run of the Olympics.

“It’s my position. Like any normal people, I don’t want war,” Heraskevych said after he finished competing. “I want peace in my country, and I want peace in the world. It’s my position, so I fight for that. I fight for peace.”

The gesture came as Russia has amassed over 100,000 troops near Ukraine, stoking fears in the West that Moscow is planning an invasion. Russia insists it has no such designs but doesn’t want Ukraine and other former Soviet countries to be allowed to join the western NATO alliance.

“In Ukraine, it’s really nervous now,” Heraskevych said. “A lot of news about guns, about weapons, what’s to come in Ukraine, about some armies around Ukraine. It’s not OK. Not in the 21st century. So I decided, before the Olympics, that I would show my position to the world.”

Shortly after the race, the International Olympic Committee said there would be no repercussions for the athlete. There had been a question of whether the body might consider Heraskevych’s act a violation of Rule 50 of the Olympic Charter. That rule, in part, states that “no kind of demonstration or political, religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any Olympic sites, venues or other areas.”

“This was a general call for peace. For the IOC the matter is closed,” the Games’ governing body said Friday night.

Heraskevych earlier said he was not concerned about any possible repercussions.

“I hope the Olympics will (support) me in this situation. Nobody wants war,” said Heraskevych, who was not a medal contender. “I hope it helps ... make peace in our country.”

The IOC relaxed its rule against protests before the Tokyo Games, allowing athletes to express themselves politically before competitions start.

In the runup to these Games, many braced for potential protests against the host country, China, which has been accused of widespread abuses against predominantly Muslim Uyghurs . It has also come under fire for its polices toward Tibet, its crackdown on freedoms in Hong Kong and the near-total disappearance from public view of tennis player Peng Shuai after she accused a former Communist Party official of sexual assault.

Concerns over human rights abuses led some countries to stage a diplomatic boycott of the Games, while Chinese organizers warned foreign athletes that any statement that goes against Chinese law could be punished.

Meanwhile, the heightened tensions over Ukraine cast a pall over last week’s opening ceremony, when IOC President Thomas Bach implored participating countries to uphold the long-running Olympic Truce , which calls for a cessation of hostilities during the Games.

Russian President Vladimir Putin, who was in attendance when Bach spoke, has drawn closer to China and some have suggested he may not want to invade Ukraine during the Olympics so as to avoid embarrassing his ally, Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Media type: Media release

Audience: General public

Australia’s Acting Chief Medical Officer, Dr Sonya Bennett, has declared the unfolding situation in Australia concerning the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) a Communicable Disease Incident of National Significance.

The declaration was made under the Emergency Response Plan for Communicable Disease Incidents of National Significance, in consultation with the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee.

Dr Bennett’s declaration followed her giving the National Security Committee of Cabinet a briefing earlier this week on the unfolding situation regarding JEV.

“I have declared the JEV situation a Communicable Disease Incident of National Significance after determining a national approach is required in relation to coordination of health policy, interventions and public messaging,” Dr Bennett said.

“A national working group of communicable disease, vaccine and arbovirus experts has been established to support the response, including mosquito surveillance and control measures and identification of those at direct risk, and for the rollout of vaccines. Public health communications regarding mosquito protection will target affected communities.""

“The Australian Government’s health and agriculture departments are working very closely with their state government counterparts to ensure a swift and coordinated response.”

On Thursday evening, Queensland officials confirmed a human case of JEV in that state. The case had recently travelled in regional parts of the state’s south and is being treated in a Brisbane hospital.

The Department of Health is aware of other cases, in multiple states, of encephalitis of unknown origin that are being investigated for arboviral diseases, including JEV.

The Australian Government will work closely with states and territories to educate the community about JEV, what precautions people should take, and symptoms to be aware of.

The Government will also work closely with the states and territories to support the distribution of vaccine doses to at-risk population groups.

JEV is a mosquito-borne viral disease that mostly occurs in pigs and horses, but can cause disease in people and rarely other animals. Pigs are the focus from a human health perspective as they can infect mosquitoes that can then infect humans. This is not the case with horses.

Humans can become infected with JEV through the bite of an infected mosquito. The virus cannot be transmitted between humans, and it cannot be caught through eating pork or pig products.

Less than 1 per cent of people infected may develop a serious illness such as encephalitis and experience symptoms including neck stiffness, severe headache and coma, and more rarely, permanent neurological complications or death.

The vast majority of infected people will show mild or no symptoms at all.

Australia’s Chief Veterinary Officer, Dr Mark Schipp, said JEV had been confirmed at 14 piggeries across NSW, SA, Queensland and Victoria.

“The key signs to look out for in pigs are stillborn or weak piglets, some with an impaired nervous system. Piglets can develop encephalitis or wasting, depression or hindlimb paralysis. Adult sows do not typically show signs of disease,” Dr Schipp said.

“In horses, many cases show no signs of the disease. Some animals may show signs of elevated temperature, jaundice, lethargy or anorexia. Other signs may include lack of coordination, difficulty swallowing, impaired vision or over-excitement.""

“Pig producers are asked to be highly vigilant for signs of this disease and report unexplained pig abortions or stillbirths.""

“People working with pigs, even if they’re only a backyard pet or a small herd, should take steps to control mosquitoes, as well as continuing to practice good biosecurity.""

“Horse owners can also put measures in place to help their horses avoid mosquito bites, including using hooded rugs, fly masks, and applying a safe insect repellent.""

“If you suspect an animal is showing signs of the disease, you must report it via your local veterinarian or the national Emergency Animal Disease Watch Hotline on 1800 675 888.”

As news of the dismissal spread, tens of thousands of protesters, many waving blue and white Israeli flags, took to the streets late at night across the country. Crowds gathered outside Netanyahu's home in Jerusalem, at one point breaching a security cordon.

Some three months since taking office, Netanyahu's nationalist-religious coalition has been plunged into crisis over the bitter divisions exposed by its flagship judicial overhaul plans.

""State security cannot be a card in the political game. Netanyahu crossed a red line tonight,"" opposition leaders Yair Lapid and Benny Gantz said in a joint statement.

539,539,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/african-swine-flu-more-cases-wild-boar-singapore-3338631,17 more cases of African swine fever found in wild boars in Singapore,"SINGAPORE: Another 17 cases of African swine fever have been detected in wild boars in Singapore.

According to the latest report by the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) on Feb 24, there are now 18 cases recorded in Singapore, more than two weeks after the National Parks Board (NParks) confirmed the country's first case on Feb 7.

Of the 18 cases, 15 were detected in wild boar carcasses while the remaining three were trapped wild boars. The three trapped boars were killed and disposed of, said WOAH.

In its epidemiological comments, it said the virus has been detected in wild boars in forested areas and nature parks in several parts of Singapore. The situation is deemed ""sufficiently stable"", it added.

In response to CNA's queries, an NParks spokesperson said on Friday (Mar 10) that the virus samples were largely found in the north of Singapore.

""NParks is currently studying how ASF (African swine fever) came to be found in wild boars in Singapore,"" said Dr Chang Siow Foong, group director at NParks' Animal and Veterinary Service (AVS)

""There is currently no vaccine or treatment for ASF. Wild boars that exhibit signs of the disease will be euthanised on welfare grounds, and carcasses found will be disposed of.""

Dr Chang added that African swine fever is endemic in Southeast Asia and spreads mainly through infected wild boars and pigs as well as contaminated materials.

According to AVS, the disease only affects members of the pig family.

African swine fever is not zoonotic, which means it cannot be transmitted to humans, and it is not a risk to public health, AVS added.

""Members of the public are reminded to stay on designated trails when visiting nature reserves, parks, and other green spaces, observe wild boars from a distance, and not to feed or get close to them,"" said the agency on its website.

The Philippines on Mar 6 announced a temporary ban on the import of pork products from Singapore. These include pork meat, pig skin, and porcine processed animal proteins.

Such items will be confiscated at all major ports of entry, said Mr Domingo F Panganiban, senior undersecretary of the Philippines’ Department of Agriculture, in a memorandum order.

Although Singapore is not an accredited exporter of pork products, Mr Panganiban said there is a need to prevent the entry of any ""African swine fever-susceptible products"" originating from Singapore that might be hand carried into the Philippines.

The ban will remain enforced unless revoked in writing, said the order.

Wild boars are native to Singapore and can be found in nature reserves, parks and other green spaces. AVS said it is ""closely monitoring the health of wild boars in these areas"".","SINGAPORE: Another 17 cases of African swine fever have been detected in wild boars in Singapore.

541,541,https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/11/china/china-xian-flu-lockdown-intl-hnk/index.html,Chinese city proposes lockdowns for flu – and faces a backlash,"Hong Kong CNN —

A Chinese city has sparked a backlash on social media after saying it would consider the use of lockdowns in the event of an influenza outbreak.

The city of Xi’an – a tourism hotspot in Shaanxi province that is home to the famous terracotta warriors – revealed an emergency response plan this week that would enable it to shut schools, businesses and “other crowded places” in the event of a severe flu epidemic.

That prompted a mixture of anxiety and anger on China’s social media websites among many users who said the plan sounded uncomfortably similar to some of the strict zero-Covid measures China had implemented throughout the pandemic and which have only recently been abandoned.

“Vaccinate the public rather than using such time to create a sense of panic,” one user wrote on Weibo, China’s equivalent of Twitter.

“How will people not panic given that Xi’an’s proposal to suspend work and business activities were issued without clear instruction on the national level to classify the disease?” asked another.

While cases of Covid in China are falling, there has been a spike in flu cases across the country and some pharmacies are struggling to meet demand for flu remedies.

However, Xi’an’s emergency response plan will not necessarily be used. Rather, it outlines how the city of almost 13 million people would respond to any future outbreak based on four levels of severity.

At the first and highest level, it says, “the city can lock down infected areas, carry out traffic quarantines and suspend production and business activities. Shopping malls, theaters, libraries, museums, tourist attractions and other crowded places will also be closed.”

“At this emergency level, schools and nurseries at all levels would be shut down and be made responsible for tracking students’ and infants’ health conditions.”

The backlash comes as the central government in Beijing has emphasized the need to open the country back up following the removal of all Covid restrictions in January.

Throughout the pandemic, China had enforced some of the world’s most severe Covid restrictions, including lockdowns that stretched into months in some cities. It was also one of the last countries in the world to end measures such as mass testing and strict border quarantine periods, even amid growing evidence of the damage being done to its economy.

Xi’an itself was subject to a draconian lockdown between December 2021 and January 2022, with 13 million residents confined to their homes for weeks on end – and many left short of food and other essential supplies. Access to medical services was also affected. In an incident that shocked and angered the nation, a heavily pregnant woman was turned away from a hospital on New Year’s Day because she didn’t have a valid Covid-19 test, and suffered a miscarriage after she was finally admitted two hours later.

Shortly before China removed its pandemic era restrictions the country had been rocked by a series of demonstrations against its zero-Covid policy.

Memories of being confined to their homes and of panic buying that in some areas led to food shortages remain fresh in people’s minds and the idea of a return to Covid-style measures appears to have hit a nerve.

However, some voices called for calm.

Epidemiologist Ben Cowling, from the University of Hong Kong’s School of Public Health, said he saw the rationale of the move.

“I think it’s quite rational to make contingency plans. I wouldn’t expect a lockdown to be needed for flu, but presumably there are different response levels,” he said.

One user on Weibo expressed a similar sentiment: “It is merely the revelation of a proposal, not putting it in place. It is quite normal to take precautions given this wave of flu is coming at us very strong.”","Hong Kong CNN —A Chinese city has sparked a backlash on social media after saying it would consider the use of lockdowns in the event of an influenza outbreak.

542,542,https://news.nus.edu.sg/enhanced-financial-aid-for-singaporean-undergraduates-from-low-income-households/,Full-time Singaporean undergraduates from low-income households to have NUS tuition fees fully covered,"Starting from the new academic year commencing in August 2022, full-time Singaporean undergraduates enrolled in the National University of Singapore (NUS) will have their tuition fees fully covered if they are from households with Per Capita Income (PCI) of up to S$1,000. The University will top up the existing Government Bursary to fully fund tuition fees for these students.

In addition, full-time Singaporean undergraduates at NUS who are from households whose PCI does not exceed S$690 will receive additional financial support for living expenses, on-campus stay and overseas exposure.

To do this, the University plans to set aside an additional funding of S$15 million per year to strengthen financial assistance for Singaporean undergraduate students who are from families with PCI not exceeding S$1,000. Both incoming and existing Singaporean full-time undergraduate students who meet the PCI criteria are eligible for the enhanced financial aid.

NUS President Professor Tan Eng Chye said, “Education is a driver for social mobility, and NUS has helped transform the lives of generations of students since our founding. It is a role we take very seriously. We are committed to providing a transformative educational experience for every NUS student, regardless of their financial background.”

He added, “While students from low-income backgrounds may already receive financial assistance from various sources, the funding they receive may not cover all of their university costs. Some students may also shy away from study abroad as well as residential programmes due to financial constraints.

The new Enhanced Financial Aid Scheme will fill the financial gap for students who are most in need of support. It provides additional funding to Singaporean students from low-income backgrounds on two fronts: by fully funding tuition fees and covering part of their living expenses; and enabling access to a more well-rounded and richer university experience that would include an on-campus stay and overseas exposure. We are grateful that some donors have come forward to help the University to realise this important initiative. We hope more will support us.”

About 3,300 Singaporean undergraduate students from low-income backgrounds are expected to benefit from the University’s latest enhancement of its financial assistance for students.","Starting from the new academic year commencing in August 2022, full-time Singaporean undergraduates enrolled in the National University of Singapore (NUS) will have their tuition fees fully covered if they are from households with Per Capita Income (PCI) of up to S$1,000.

543,543,https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/first-gene-therapy-for-tay-sachs-disease-successfully-given-to-two-children/,First Gene Therapy for Tay-Sachs Disease Successfully Given to Two Children,"The following essay is reprinted with permission from The Conversation, an online publication covering the latest research.

Two babies have received the first-ever gene therapy for Tay-Sachs disease after over 14 years of development.

Tay-Sachs is a severe neurological disease caused by a deficiency in an enzyme called HexA. This enzyme breaks down a fatlike substance that normally exists in very small, harmless amounts in the brain. Without HexA, however, this fatlike substance can accumulate to toxic levels that damage and kill neurons.

One of the symptoms of this disease was first described in 1883 by British ophthalmologist Warren Tay, who saw a cherry-red spot on the back of the eye of affected infants. In 1887, American neurologist Bernard Sachs described the profound neurological symptoms of Tay-Sachs in a seminal paper:

“… Nothing abnormal was noticed until the age of two to three months, when the parents observed that the child was much more listless than children of that age. … The child would ordinarily lay upon its back, and was never able to change its position … it never attempted any voluntary movement … the child grew steadily weaker, it ceased to take its food properly, its bronchial troubles increased, and finally, pneumonia set in, it died August, 1886.”

This dismal description of Tay-Sachs remains current, and those with the disease usually die by age 5. Some people develop Tay-Sachs later in life, with symptoms starting in their teens that get progressively worse over many decades.

Unfortunately there is still no treatment for Tay-Sachs. Aggressive medical treatment can extend survival but doesn’t improve neurological function. The only effective way to treat Tay-Sachs is to restore the HexA enzyme in the brain. This is difficult, however, because the blood-brain barrier prevents most molecules from passing into the brain.

I am a member of a team of researchers from UMass Chan Medical School and Auburn University who developed a gene therapy that may help get around this barrier. Our treatment uses two harmless viral vectors to deliver DNA instructions to brain cells that teach them how to produce the missing enzyme. Similar techniques have been used to treat a number of related diseases and other conditions. In the case of Tay-Sachs, these DNA instructions enter the nucleus of these cells and stay there, allowing for long-term production of HexA. Based on our previous studies successfully testing our gene therapy on different animal species, we believe that delivering the treatment to a central part of the brain allows the enzyme to travel along its connections to other regions and to be distributed throughout the entire brain.

The first child who received our gene therapy treatment was age 2 ½, with late-stage disease symptoms. Three months after treatment, they had better muscle control and could focus their eyes. Now at age 5, the child is in stable health and is seizure-free, which usually isn’t possible for patients at this age. A second child treated at age 7 months had improved brain development by the three-month follow-up and remains seizure-free at a little over age 2.

More testing is needed to confirm whether our treatment can fully stop disease progression. Given that this was the first time our treatment was given to humans, we used a conservative dose below the maximum therapeutic effects we saw in our animal studies. My colleagues and I are currently conducting a follow-up clinical trial to test the safety and efficacy of increasing doses in a larger number of patients.

Researching rare diseases can lead to advances in medicine as a whole.

The increasing cost of manufacturing these treatments makes it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to develop and test gene therapy for many ultrarare diseases where the number of patients worldwide is very small and profitability low.

We were able to deliver these treatments to the children in our ongoing clinical trials thanks only to funding from a generous family whose own child is a participant. This grassroots approach is a common theme in ultrarare disease research – development and testing are often supported by parents, foundations and federal grants.

Our Translational Institute for Molecular Therapeutics program at UMass Chan Medical School focuses on developing more viral vector gene therapies for an ever-expanding number of ultrarare diseases in collaboration with families and foundations. We believe every patient afflicted with any of the approximately 7,000 rare diseases worldwide deserves a chance at a normal life.

544,544,https://www.nebraskamed.com/cancer/can-a-gluten-free-diet-prevent-celiac-disease-or-cancer,Can a gluten-free diet prevent celiac disease or cancer?,"This article provided by Erin Williams, graduate student in medical nutrition.

Pasta, salad dressings, bread – these are a few examples of foods that contain gluten. Gluten is a protein that is found in wheat, barley and rye foods. It acts as a ""glue"" for food to maintain its shape and texture.

A common question is if gluten can increase inflammation and your overall cancer risk. Let's look at the science.

Can gluten cause celiac disease? No.

Celiac disease is a disease that affects a person's intestines. When individuals with this disease eat food with gluten in it, their bodies send a powerful response. This response attacks the person's intestines and seriously damages them. Celiac disease is a genetic disease, so, avoiding gluten does not decrease someone's risk of it.

1 in 133 Americans has celiac disease – about 1% of the population.

Symptoms of celiac disease:

Bloating

Chronic diarrhea

Constipation

Gas

Lactose intolerance

Loose, greasy, bulky and smelly stools

Nausea or vomiting

Pain the abdomen

If you have celiac disease, it's important to avoid gluten. Choose gluten-free grains like rice, quinoa, buckwheat and oats (make sure they are certified gluten-free).

Can gluten increase my cancer risk? No.

On its own, gluten does not cause inflammation in non-celiac individuals. Eating gluten-containing foods does not increase inflammation in these people. This also means it does not increase a person's risk for developing, or redeveloping, cancer. In fact, eating 3 ounces of whole grains daily can actually decrease the risk for certain cancers. If you haven't been diagnosed with celiac disease, you don't need to avoid gluten.

An England study found that celiac patients following a gluten-free diet did not have an increased risk of developing cancer. However, people with celiac disease who were eating some amount of gluten saw an increased risk of certain cancers.

'epilepsy warrior' is changing lives","Since being diagnosed with epilepsy at the age of two, Ava Pitre, 9, has not been able to go 24 hours without a seizure.

Instead of a setback, Ava is using her medical condition as an opportunity to raise tens of thousands of dollars to help others with epilepsy feel safe in their homes by providing them with a device that changed her life.

“When she was first diagnosed, SUPED (Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy) was a huge fear. So I basically slept in the living room on the floor because I didn’t want to be too far from her,” says Ava’s mother, Erin Pitre.

Bedtime was stressful for the Pitre family until they were gifted an anti-suffocation pillow a few years ago by a local family.

The special pillow is made out of several layers of foam with large air channels to allow for better air passage.

“This pillow has allowed me to get back into a bed. I don’t have the fear of her seizing face-down in bed,” explains Erin. Ava Pitre, (second from right) has Epilepsy and works to raise money to help others with the condition, March 7, 2022. (Sijia Liu / CTV News)According to Epilepsy Southwestern Ontario, an anti-suffocation pillow is not an approved medical device in Canada, but it is in other countries and can provide families with peace of mind.

“Stress is highly correlated with seizure frequency. My impression is if you have a pillow and it helps you feel less stressed, it may potentially reduce seizures,” says Michelle Franklin, Epilepsy Southwestern Ontario CEO.

In March, Ava raises money to help purchase anti-suffocation pillows for others with epilepsy by selling items donated to her from local businesses — Over the last three years, she has raised over $33,000.

“I love helping people cause like because I love giving the support,” says Ava.

Her fundraising efforts will being honoured by Epilepsy Southwestern Ontario this spring when the organization presents her with its most prestigious award, the H.O.P.E award.

“One in 100 people are affected by epilepsy. It’s people like Ava that will stand up and say it’s no big deal, it’s a part of me but not who I am,” says Franklin.","Since being diagnosed with epilepsy at the age of two, Ava Pitre, 9, has not been able to go 24 hours without a seizure.

What should I do?,"SINGAPORE – Manpower reporter Tay Hong Yi offers practical answers to candid questions on navigating workplace challenges and getting ahead in your career.

Q: I repeatedly took on new responsibilities that I was told would increase my promotion chances, yet was never promoted. What should I do when promotion seems like a moving target?

A: In general, taking on more responsibilities over an extended period or even permanently does usually lead to a promotion, says Ms Godelieve van Dooren, chief executive for South-east Asia growth markets at Mercer.

“Having said that, some responsibilities hold more weight than others.”

Covering for a colleague in a similar role who is away temporarily typically does not lead to a promotion, for example.

So employees have to be mindful and strategic about the additional work they decide to take on.

While opting to undertake more tasks at the office is a show of initiative, it is not the end-all of securing promotion, says Ms Jaya Dass, managing director of Asia-Pacific permanent recruitment at Randstad.

“Taking on more responsibility at work is not just about adding tasks to your to-do list – it’s important to consider which areas you can add significant value in and support your professional development.”

This can include ways of optimising processes you encounter at work to cut costs, she adds.

Ms van Dooren says: “What does tend to lead to promotions is taking on responsibilities outside your area of expertise or job scope, and taking on roles that carry a greater deal of risk, like sales or revenue-generating ones.”

Moreover, a proficient employee who deserves promotion may still be passed over for various reasons, she notes. “Even if you are successful in stepping up, what can sometimes get in the way of a promotion is affordability.

“Can your company afford to promote you and does its structure afford enough room for employees to consistently rise up the ranks?”

Employers may be unable to promote competent employees if there are a limited number of leadership roles, or if a higher scope of work is not available for a specific role, Ms Dass says.

Other reasons include a lack of essential skills and experience for the next step despite the additional work, a company culture that favours promotions based on tenure, or a preference for hiring externally.","SINGAPORE – Manpower reporter Tay Hong Yi offers practical answers to candid questions on navigating workplace challenges and getting ahead in your career.

A team, led by Nora Shero, Medical University of the Americas, identified the relationship between maternal Crohn’s disease with iron deficiency anemia and ADHD in children.

Pregnant women with IBD often also have iron deficiency anemia. However, while studies have shown certain maternal autoimmune diseases are linked to ADHD in children, there has been no research showing a relationship specifically between IDA in pregnant women with IBD and ADHD in their children.

“Although studies have shown an association between certain maternal autoimmune diseases and ADHD in offspring, not much is known about how maternal inflammatory bowel diseases, such as Crohn's disease, affect neurodevelopment in progeny,” the authors wrote. “Studies have suggested that inflammation from autoimmune disorders is the main trigger of the fetal neurodevelopment that leads to ADHD.”

Examining the Data

In the study, the investigators reviewed various studies on pregnant women with Crohn’s disease and IDA and children with ADHD, including nested case-control studies, cohort studies, cross-sectional studies, case-control studies, and literature reviews published between 2012-2021.

Overall, there were 876 articles found, with 11 studies included in the final analysis. Animal studies were also eliminated from the analysis.

The investigators found that ADHD in progeny could contribute to maternal Crohn’s disease. However, there were no studies found that show iron deficiency anemia in mothers with Crohn’s disease is related to ADHD in the offspring.

The Relationship Between IDA and ADHD

On the other hand, there were several studies showing a positive correlation between maternal IDA and ADHD in offspring. There were also some studies suggesting inflammation in IBD during pregnancy leading to inflammation of the central nervous system and ultimately leading to ADHD in the offspring.

Overall, the summarized results of the 11 studies selected support the hypothesis that IDA in mothers with Crohn’s disease is a risk factor for ADHD in offspring and that iron is a contributory function in the pathophysiology of ADHD.

“IDA is a prevalent complication in [Crohn’s disease], and inadequate iron levels are associated with neurodevelopmental problems, such as ADHD,” the authors wrote. “Iron therapy for pregnant mothers diagnosed with [Crohn’s disease] is suggested to prevent ADHD in offspring.”

Theories on Why?

One reason for this is brain development could become impaired due to iron deficiencies, which can increase the risk of ADHD in children.

And patients with Crohn’s disease are more likely to develop anemia due to malabsorption or bleeding caused by the disease. Other autoimmune diseases also contribute to ADHD among children, including asthma and psoriasis.

The results also support previous findings indicating children diagnosed with ADHD have lower serum ferritin compared to children without ADHD.

There are several reasons why patients with IBD often have iron deficiencies, including increased iron loss from mucosal bleeding caused by gastrointestinal inflammation, a decrease in iron absorption in short bowel syndrome, decreased appetite during IBD outbreaks, and inflammation-driven blockage of intestinal iron acquisition and macrophage iron reutilization.

Inflammatory cytokines can also directly inhibit iron absorption and stimulate the uptake and retention of iron in macrophages.

Two vaccinators and a social mobilizer were killed in Emamsaheb district of Kunduz province.

In the wake of the carnage, the UN immediately suspended the national polio vaccination campaign in Kunduz and Takhar provinces.

Violation of humanitarian law

Ramiz Alakbarov, the Secretary-General’s Deputy Special Representative for Afghanistan, took to Twitter to express condemnation in the strongest terms. He said the attacks and assassinations were a violation of international humanitarian law.

The head of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyeus, has also expressed his profound shock. Four of the health workers were women, he said in a post on Twitter.

“We extend our deepest condolences to their families and colleagues,” he wrote, adding that health workers should not be targeted.

Health under fire

The UN Country Team was appalled by the brutality of the killings, noting that this was not the first time health workers have come under attack.

Last year, nine polio workers were killed during national polio vaccination campaigns.

These immunization exercises are a vital and effective way to reach millions of children to protect them against polio, the UN statement said, and depriving them from an assurance of a healthy life is inhumane.

“This senseless violence must stop immediately, and those responsible must be investigated and brought to justice. These attacks are a violation of international humanitarian law.”

The UN strongly condemns all attacks on health workers anywhere, stressing that delivery of health care is impartial.

Children suffer most

The polio vaccination campaign in Afghanistan is supported by WHO, together with the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and other partners.

They planned to target nearly 10 million under-fives across the country this month, with four more rounds scheduled for the rest of the year.

Dr Ahmed Al-Mandhari, WHO Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean, said the suspension of the programme in Kunduz and Takhar provinces leaves thousands of children unprotected and exposed to a life-threatening disease that can result in permanent paralysis.

In calling for an end to “senseless attacks” on health workers, Dr. Al-Mandhari pointed out that they are strictly forbidden in all faiths.

“These cowardly acts ultimately only harm innocent children who must be given every opportunity to live safe and healthy lives,” he said.

“WHO condemns all attacks on health workers in the strongest terms and appeal to the Taliban Authorities to immediately identify and bring the perpetrators to justice.”","Tweet URL We condemn today's attack and assaination of 8 polio vaccination workers in #Afghanistan in strongest terms.

Kare, compared to Indian curries, is less spicy, sweeter, darker, and usually thicker due to the addition of flour or roux. The most popular variety of kare is kare raisu (curry over rice) which has also been ranked sixth on TasteAtlas’ list.

Kare raisu is usually served with fukujinzuke pickles or Japanese scallions on the side.

Other main versions of kare in Japan include kare udon (curry over noodles) and kare-pan (a pastry filled with curry).

Meanwhile, khao soi, a signature dish of Northern Thailand, is described as a curried noodle with a slightly spicy broth, combining coconut milk and red curry paste as the base of the dish. It is served with flat egg noodles and a choice of meat - usually chicken, beef or pork - and is topped with a handful of crisp fried noodles and chopped cilantro.

Khao soi is commonly served alongside a variety of condiments such as fresh lime, pickled cabbage, shallots, and chillis.

Other dishes rounding out the top five curries in TasteAtlas’ list include India’s shahi paneer and butter chicken in the fourth and fifth spot respectively.

Originating from India's Moghul cuisine, shahi paneer is a cheese curry that is prepared with paneer cheese, onions, almond paste, as well as a rich, spicy tomato-cream sauce.

According to TasteAtlas, the dish is typically accompanied by Indian breads such as naan, roti, or puri.

On the other hand, the famous Indian butter chicken is a combination of roasted meat, plenty of spices, and a rich gravy made with cream, tomatoes and butter. It is usually eaten with naan bread and garnished with even more butter, coriander, or green chillis.

Meanwhile, the Singapore fish head curry dish took the 38th spot on TasteAtlas’ list with a ranking of 3.6 out of 5 stars. It is a Singaporean specialty dish comprising fish heads, coconut cream, tomatoes, and an array of seasonings such as curry leaves, garlic, chilli, coriander, cumin, turmeric, pepper, and tamarind.

Today, it is served with bread or rice on the side, and one pot of fish head curry can easily feed a few people.

They are the pioneering group of food businesses under the new Farm-to-Table (FTT) Recognition Programme, which was created by the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) and local associations to encourage more restaurants and eateries to opt for local vegetables, fish and eggs.

The 11 recipients, which include catering firms Foodtalks Caterer and Manufacturer, and Kitchen Haus Group, as well as Resorts World Sentosa (RWS), received the FTT Recognition Programme logo.

Local vegetable and fish farms have said they need support and consistent demand from local consumers and food businesses to stay commercially viable.

A few vegetable farms have told The Straits Times that they have had to throw or donate a portion of their leafy greens due to slow sales. Others have had to scale down production to prevent wastage.

Locally grown greens contributed to 4.3 per cent of vegetables consumed in Singapore in 2021 – a figure that can be higher if there is more consistent demand and retailer support, urban farmers said previously.

The new recognition programme is open to hotels, restaurants and caterers that source at least 15 per cent of their fresh produce, in dollar value, from local farms.

With three award tiers under the programme, businesses that source more types of local produce will be given a higher award tier.

The programme was formed by SFA, the Association of Catering Professionals Singapore, the Restaurant Association of Singapore and the Singapore Hotel Association.

Businesses looking to apply for the programme can visit https://go.gov.sg/ftt, with each award valid for two years.

Speaking at the award ceremony at RWS on Monday, Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment Koh Poh Koon said: “As we work on supply-side measures to increase local production, equally important is the corresponding demand to complement that. These perishable items cannot just be left on the shelf for months.

Dr Koh added that it must make financial sense for farmers here to produce more, and the market signal must come from consumers.","SINGAPORE - Eleven hotels, restaurants and caterers were recognised on Monday for sourcing a portion of their food ingredients from local farms.
They are the pioneering group of food businesses under the new Farm-to-Table (FTT) Recognition Programme, which was created by the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) and local associations to encourage more restaurants and eateries to opt for local vegetables, fish and eggs.
The 11 recipients, which include catering firms Foodtalks Caterer and Manufacturer, and Kitchen Haus Group, as well as Resorts World Sentosa (RWS), received the FTT Recognition Programme logo.
Local vegetable and fish farms have said they need support and consistent demand from local consumers and food businesses to stay commercially viable.
With three award tiers under the programme, businesses that source more types of local produce will be given a higher award tier.",2023-03-27 17:17:41+08:00,[],[],[],[],,

The team has identified a new antibody people produce in response to bites from an infected tick, which they say can also show when people are cured and help distinguish reinfections from other ailments.

Lyme disease affects almost 500,000 people in the US every year and can cause fevers, headaches, rashes, and on the more serious side of things, damage to the heart, brain and nervous system. Antibiotics are largely effective at curtailing the condition, and we've seen some promising advances that could improve treatment effectiveness even further.

Tests for Lyme disease exist but do have their limitations. They work by detecting antibodies made by the body in response to infection, but these can take weeks to develop so the test may not detect a recent infection. Further, the antibodies can persist in the blood for months or years after an infection is gone, making it difficult to tell whether someone has been cured.

“Traditional Lyme tests can stay positive for prolonged periods of time after treatment – years or even a lifetime,” said Peter Gwynne, study author from Tufts University. “As a result, for some individuals suffering from symptoms that resemble long-term Lyme disease infection, clinicians are never sure whether the patient has persistent Lyme disease, was cured and then reinfected, or was cured and is suffering from something else.”

The scientists started out by studying the way the bacterium that causes Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi, acquires nutrients from its surrounding environment to fuel its growth.

“In the process of our research, we found that the organism takes fats called phospholipids directly from its surroundings in the host, and puts them on its surface,” says study author Linden Hu. “That finding led us to look to see if the direct use of a host fat by the bacteria might lead the immune system to recognize it as a foreign substance and create antibodies to it.”

The scientists indeed found that both animals and human patients infected with Borrelia burgdorferi did develop autoantibodies in response, which are antibodies that mistakenly target the host's own tissues and organs. Because of this and the damage they can cause, autoantibodies are often short-lived and tend to go away soon after their trigger is removed.

This quick increase and decrease in the autoantibody numbers could serve as the basis for a rapid test that can address some shortcomings with current diagnosis techniques, according to the scientists.

“The anti-phospholipid autoantibodies – because of their quick increase and quick resolution with treatment– can fill these gaps as a novel additional test,” Gwynne said. “They may make it possible to tell whether treatment has eradicated the Lyme disease bacteria. And they therefore also make it possible to tell if a patient with a prior infection now has a new infection.”

With a provisional patent for the technique, the scientists hope, following further research, a diagnostics company can translate it into a commercial test within the next couple of years. They also plan to explore the idea that these autoantibodies can help reveal people suffering from persistent symptoms of Lyme disease. This can occur in up to 20 percent of patients and can only be diagnosed through clinical symptoms, making it hard to separate the condition from other lingering ailments.

“If there ends up being a link between having persistent Lyme symptoms and these autoantibodies, this would be the first test that could be used to distinguish a group of patients who have persistent Lyme disease,” said Hu. “It would allow us to test specific new therapies targeted to a defined mechanism.”

The research was published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation.

Tottenham have named Cristian Stellini as their caretaker manager for the rest of the season.

Antonio Conte’s departure was confirmed late on Sunday night after talks over his future, with the club defining his exit as by “mutual consent”.

Previously serving as Conte’s assistant at Inter Milan and then Spurs, Stellini has stepped up under the official job title of acting head coach for the final 10 games of the Premier League campaign.

Ryan Mason, who had widely been tipped to assume the post, will be Stellini’s assistant.

The news follows his stint in charge of Spurs during Conte’s absence following gallbladder surgery, as well as when the head coach was banned for the Champions League trip to Marseille.

Stellini enjoyed an initially positive set of results, winning his first four games before demoralising defeats to Sheffield United and Wolves.

Chairman Daniel Levy has called on the club to “step up” and secure qualification for next season’s Champions League.

He said: “We have 10 Premier League games remaining and we have a fight on our hands for a Champions League place.

“We all need to pull together. Everyone has to step up to ensure the highest possible finish for our Club and amazing, loyal supporters.”","Antonio Conte’s departure was confirmed late on Sunday night after talks over his future, with the club defining his exit as by “mutual consent”.

Our literature search yielded 458 records: 154 were identified through PubMed-Medline, 173 from the Scopus databases, 32 via EBSCOhost and 99 through the AJOL platforms. No additional publications on the association between PBDs and CVD risk in Africa, apart from this systematic review’s protocol [35] was identified via the Conference Proceedings Citation Index (CPCI). Six duplicates were identified prior to screening the TIABs. During the TIABs screening we identified two articles that reported findings from the same study cohort, and the most comprehensive publication was selected. Four hundred and twelve studies were excluded based on the reasons summarized in Fig. 1. After full text assessment, fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Nine of the eligible studies were retrieved from PubMed-Medline [39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50], and three from the EBSCOhost platform [51,52,53]. No additional studies were identified after manually screening the reference lists of the included studies.

Study characteristics

Included studies originated from 12 countries across SSA: (n = 1) Kenya [44], (n = 1) Botswana [52], (n = 1) Zambia [42], (n = 1) Ghana [48], (n = 1) Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) [50], (n = 1) Ethiopia [53], (n = 3) Tanzania [43, 45, 47], and (n = 7) South Africa [39,40,41, 46, 47, 49, 51]. One study [47] had four recruitment sites namely Nigeria, Tanzania, South Africa, and Uganda. In addition to this, five African countries namely Mozambique, Nigeria, South Africa, Sudan, and Uganda participated in a multi-country study [39]. According to the World Bank data [54], 2 of the 12 SSA countries are classified as upper middle income [40, 41, 46, 49, 51, 52], 6 are low-to-middle income [42,43,44,45, 47, 48, 50], and 4 are low-income countries [39, 47, 53]. The included studies (n = 15) were published from the year 2002 to 2020. There was low heterogeneity across studies in terms of study design: 13 were cross-sectional [40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48, 50,51,52,53], 1 cohort [49] and 1 case-control [39]. Eighty-seven percent of the included studies had a cross-sectional study design with comparable health outcomes (e.g., 7 of the 15 studies assessed overweight/obesity). However, the included studies reported on different dietary exposures, association measures, and were conducted in study populations with different characteristics (Tables 1 and 2) that could not be pooled to conduct meta-analyses. Therefore, we provide a narrative summary of their findings. The total number of participants across included studies was 11,088, and per study, the number of participants ranged from 110 to 2362. All participants were adults 18 years or older, and the proportion of men ranged from 0 to 52%. Two of the studies did not provide clear estimates for the age of their participants and three studies did not assess a dietary comparator; therefore, we did not extract data for these variables (Tables 1 and 2).

Plant-based dietary exposures identified in the African setting

Across the fifteen studies, the following plant-based dietary exposures were identified (see Additional file 4: Table S3): the consumption of plant foods, indicator food categories, adhering to a healthy dietary index and plant-based dietary or nutrient patterns.

Consumption of plant foods

Eight of the included studies reported on the consumption of healthy plant foods. Fruits and vegetables were the most frequently reported plant foods [40, 42, 44, 46, 51, 53]. In addition to assessing the consumption of fruits and vegetables, we regarded the consumption of salads as a healthy plant food [51]. Other included studies assessed the usual consumption of vegetables with a high antioxidant content: leafy vegetables such as Cassava leaves (Manihot esculanta) and Bitetkuteku (Amaranthus Hybridus), and fruit vegetables and legumes namely Solo (Solanum aethiopicum) and dried red beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) [50], as well as green vegetables and coconut milk [45].

Indicator food categories

One study reported on the assessment of six indicator food categories of which 3 met the criteria of our dietary exposure; the categories comprised of healthy plant foods such as fruits, vegetables, and legumes. These indicator food categories were identified using a food frequency questionnaire [41].

Dietary index

A multi-country case-control study that included five African countries, applied the modified Alternative Healthy Eating Index (mAHEI) as a measure of dietary quality and investigated its relation to the incidence of stroke. The mAHEI includes the primary components of a PBD such as fruits, vegetables, wholes, nuts, and legumes [39].

Plant-based dietary and nutrient patterns

Thirty-three percent of the studies reported on dietary patterns with higher factor loadings of plant versus animal foods. We classified these five studies as having plant-based dietary exposure patterns. Galbete et al., reported on the “Roots, tubers and plantain” dietary pattern, which was identified in their rural Ghanaian participants using principal component analysis (PCA) [48]. The PCA method was also applied by Holmes and colleagues who identified a “Mixed” dietary pattern, which differed slightly by sex. Three plant-based dietary patterns were identified in women from urban and rural areas in Botswana. Motswagole et al., labelled them as the: “Fruit and vegetable”, “Fish and nuts” and “Botswana traditional foods” dietary patterns [52]. Another study identified the “Healthy” and “Complex carbohydrate” dietary patterns that had high factor loadings for fruits, vegetables as well as legumes, roots, and tubers [43]. One study identified four plant driven nutrient patterns namely the “Magnesium, Phosphorus and Plant protein” and “Starch, Dietary Fibre and Vitamin B” driven patterns that was identified in rural Black South African women, and the “Thiamine, Starch and Folate” driven pattern in urban women. In addition to, the “Thiamine, Zinc and Plant Protein” pattern that was identified in their male counterparts [49].

CVD risk outcomes and measures of association

All included studies reported on CVD/CVD risk profile as a health outcome: acute stroke (n = 1), dyslipidaemia (n = 1), MetS (n = 1), hypertension (n = 3), T2D (n = 3), and overweight/obesity (n = 7) and assessed its relation to plant-based dietary exposures. Most of the studies reported their effect estimate using ORs [42, 47, 48, 50, 53], and others reported the ARRs [43], relative risk (RR) [52] and population attributable risk (PAR) [39]. Katalambula et al., was the only study to present their data using ARRs [43]. Therefore, based on common statistical terminology and for the purpose of interpreting their results we assumed that it represents the absolute risk reduction (ARR) [55]. The association measures were presented with precision i.e., 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs), however, O’Donnell et al. was the only study that provided a narrower interval with 99% confidence [39]. Almost a third of the studies reported their data as prevalence estimates using count and percentage proportions [39, 40, 46, 47]. Three studies reported means with [51] or without standard deviations [44] and/or medians with the interquartile ranges [41]. Even fewer studies (n = 2) reported β regression coefficients with 95% CIs [45, 49]. A summary of the abovementioned reported effect estimates was recorded (see Additional file 4: Table S3).

Association between plant-based dietary exposures and CVD risk profile in SSA

None of the included studies in this review stated that they assessed a PBD per se; however, they either assessed specific plant foods, food groups and/or dietary and nutrient patterns that were consistent with our dietary exposure of interest. Our results are therefore, presented according to the assessment of plant-based dietary exposures and their potential benefits to protect African populations against CVD. Nine studies had significant associations between the plant-based dietary exposures and CVD risk factors, this is outlined in Table S3 as part of the supplementary material (see Additional file 4). However, there was no significant association between hard CVD and the plant-based dietary exposure. In addition to this, no studies reported data on factors, which may alter the associations that were found between the plant-based dietary exposures and CVD risk profile across African populations. Below we have outlined the results and analyses performed by the studies that reported significant findings.

Plant-based dietary exposures and type 2 diabetes (T2D)

The RODAM study investigated different dietary patterns among Ghanaian adults in relation with T2D risk. Only after conducting sensitivity analyses that excluded individuals with self-reported diabetes, did the authors find an inverse association (p = 0.016) with their plant-based dietary exposure. Rural Ghanaians had the highest adherence to the “roots, tubers and plantain” dietary pattern that was inversely associated with T2D, as presented for the highest tertile in adjusted model 3, the OR was 0.98 (95% CI:0.71–1.35) [48]. In South Africa, Chikowore et al. investigated which dietary factors are associated with predictive biomarkers of T2D. Two of the plant driven nutrient patterns that they identified: “Starch, dietary fibre and B vitamins” and the “Thiamine, zinc and plant protein” patterns, had significant inverse associations with the glycaemic markers in their rural participants. In men, the latter nutrient pattern inversely associated with low glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels [β = − 0.288 (95% CI: − 0.543; − 0.033)], and fasting blood glucose levels [β = − 0.382 (95% CI: − 0.752; − 0.012)]. In rural women, who followed the “Starch, dietary fibre and B vitamins” driven nutrient pattern; the fasting glucose [β = − 0.236 (95% CI: − 0.458; − 0.014)] and HbA1c levels [β = − 0.175 (95% CI: − 0.303; − 0.047)] were significantly lower in the fully adjusted regression model [49].

Plant-based dietary exposures and hypertension

Three studies found inverse associations between hypertension, and either the consumption of plant foods or a plant-based dietary pattern. Rush et al., reported significant rural vs. urban differences in the dietary intake of fruits amongst adults from Zambia (48.5% vs. 17.1%, p < 0.001). They found that eating more vegetables during the week was inversely associated with hypertension in rural Zambians, with an adjusted OR of 0.76 (95% CI:0.45–0.94) [42]. In Tanzania, Katalambula and colleagues conducted a study in residents of Arusha and showed that 42% of their participants consumed a ‘Healthy’ dietary pattern and were less likely to have hypertension. There was a significant negative association between the ‘Healthy’ dietary pattern and being hypertensive, the ARR was reported to be 0.82 (95% CI:0.68–0.99) [43]. The dietary practices of hypertensive patients from Kenya were assessed in relation to other risk factors. We observed that the authors of this study by Kimani et al., only reported crude association estimates (i.e., mean values) for their plant-based dietary exposures. In the latter study, the consumption of vegetables was significantly associated with a lower mean systolic blood pressure (SBP), for daily vs. frequently vs. rarely consuming vegetables and (p-values): 138.36 mmHg vs. 142.49 mmHg vs. 153.25 mmHg (0.032), lower diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 87.83 mmHg vs. 92.87 mmHg vs. 98.38 mmHg (p = 0.024), and lower body mass index (BMI) 28.55 kg/m2 vs. 29.85 kg/m2 vs. 34.36 kg/m2 (p = 0.006). The consumption of fruits daily, frequently and rarely was respectively associated with a lower mean BMI of 27.99 kg/m2, 29.68 kg/m2 and 29.79 kg/m2 (p = 0.011), and lower mean total cholesterol (TC) of 5.31 mmol/L, 5.71 mmol/L and 5.49 mmol/L (p = 0.033). The authors only conducted regression analysis for other risk factors i.e., BMI and alcohol intake, and did not report any adjusted association measures (i.e., ORs) for their dietary practices. As mentioned above, their dietary practices namely fruit and vegetable consumption appear to be inversely associated with hypertension based on the crude estimates [44].

Plant-based dietary exposures and overweight/obesity

Three of the included studies reported significant negative associations between the consumption of plant foods and plant-based dietary patterns with overweight/obesity [40, 45, 51]. In the Eastern Cape province of South Africa, Otang-Mbeng and colleagues found that regularly eating vegetables was negatively associated with obesity (p < 0.05). However, the latter study did not perform regression analysis to determine whether adjusting for confounders such as older age and female sex, would affect the inverse association between vegetable consumption and obesity. Of note, this study had a quality score of 5 out of 14, which reflects poorly on its methodology [35]. In Tanzania, a study examined the association between obesity and the consumption of green vegetables and coconut milk among residents from three areas. Positive correlations were found between the consumption of coconut milk and BMI (p < 0.001), which was seen in both sexes. In addition to this, BMI status also correlated positively with the consumption of green vegetables (p < 0.001). Subsequently, when adjusting for confounders such as age in the multivariable regression analysis, it revealed that the positive association between the BMI status and coconut milk consumption only remained significant in males (p = 0.003) [45]. Motswagole et al., conducted a study in Botswana that identified six dietary patterns that were prevalent in females, and we regarded three of these patterns as being plant-based (Table 2). In their study there was a positive association between a high intake of the vegetable and fruit pattern and the risk of central obesity, RR of 1.43 (95% CI:1.18–1.72). Likewise, strong positive associations were seen in females with a higher adherence to the Botswana traditional food pattern and the risk of general (RR = 1.60, 95% CI:1.21–2.10) and central obesity (RR = 1.35, 95% CI:1.12–1.64). These positive associations were only maintained in individuals that were ranked as being highly adherent to the Botswana traditional food pattern (i.e., tertile 3); in spite of the further adjustments in their multivariate model that accounted for total energy intake [52].

Plant-based dietary exposures and dyslipidaemia

Njelekela and colleagues also investigated the association between dyslipidaemia and dietary factors. They found a negative correlation between green vegetables consumption and TC in both males and females. However, these findings did not remained significant in their multivariable regression analyses that adjusted for age and BMI [45].

Plant-based dietary exposures and metabolic syndrome (MetS)

One study investigated the association between antioxidant rich vegetables and a combination of CVD risk factors to determine the risk of MetS. This study was conducted among T2D patients in the DRC and its dietary focus was the regular consumption of vegetables rich in antioxidants. Only 13% of the study participants never consumed vegetables that are rich in antioxidants, and none of the T2D patients reported that they ate fruits. This study population mostly consumed Cassava leaves (39%), and dried red beans (26%) as their source of antioxidants, which were the only plant-based dietary exposures that was inversely associated with MetS after adjusting for confounders in their regression analysis. The consumption of Cassava leaves was found to have an independent protective effect on the risk of having MetS with an OR of 0.40 (95% CI:0.20–0.90). Similar inverse associations were reported in those consuming dried red beans, which was also protective against MetS with an OR of 0.40 (95% CI:0.20–0.80) [50].

Quality assessment of the included studies

The quality of the 15 studies was assessed using the NHLBI tool for observational studies, the supplementary material shows the quality scores for each of the included studies (see Additional file 4: Table S2). The NHLBI quality assessment tool for cross-sectional and cohort studies consists of 14 questions, which were used to critically assess the methodology of 14 of the included studies. Only one study [39] was assessed using the NHLBI quality assessment tool for case-control studies that considered 12 criteria to rate the methodological quality. Fourteen studies were rated as having fair methodological quality, and one study [40] received a poor-quality rating. Two of the eligible studies [40, 41] did not meet at least 50% of the quality criteria as stipulated in the NHBLI tool for cross-sectional studies. Moreover, the majority of the included studies report cross-sectional findings that are prone to several biases and confounders [37]. Cross-sectional studies [56] are based on observations at a single timepoint, with insufficient power if the sample size is reasonably small [40, 51], which presents a poorer level of evidence [57]. Additionally, we cannot determine whether e.g., the identified plant-based dietary exposures are the cause or effect of the reduction in CVD risk factors, and vice versa. Causal relationships can only be deduced from longitudinal cohort observational and randomized intervention studies or case-control observational studies, where the effect/outcome is known [56].

We did not exclude any of the eligible studies based on quality, however, we have interpreted the results whilst considering its limitations. We identified minor instances of implausible reporting of study findings. In terms of the study characteristics specifically the demographics; two of the studies [44, 46] presented the age of their participants in a manner that was not easy to interpret. Kimani et al., reported age as a categorial variable by comparing three age groups, however, reporting the mean age would have given the readers an indication as to whether or not the age variable was normally distributed [44]. Masilela and others followed the same approach by only reporting the age of their participants categorically (Table 1). Although these are minor reporting biases, age is a well-known confounder when assessing associations, and should therefore be reported as clearly as possible. Masilela et al., appropriately adjusted for age during their logistic regression analysis [46]. However, Kimani and colleagues did not state whether they adjusted for age in their regression models and did not include all the relevant predictors. In the paper by Kimani et al., they did not state why they did not perform logistic regression analysis for their plant-based dietary exposures i.e., daily consumption of fruits and vegetables, which was statistically significant in their analysis of variance (ANOVA) tables [44].","Plant-based dietary and nutrient patternsThirty-three percent of the studies reported on dietary patterns with higher factor loadings of plant versus animal foods.
Our results are therefore, presented according to the assessment of plant-based dietary exposures and their potential benefits to protect African populations against CVD.
Plant-based dietary exposures and hypertensionThree studies found inverse associations between hypertension, and either the consumption of plant foods or a plant-based dietary pattern.
Plant-based dietary exposures and overweight/obesityThree of the included studies reported significant negative associations between the consumption of plant foods and plant-based dietary patterns with overweight/obesity [40, 45, 51].

Through contact tracing, approximately 161 people have been identified as at risk of infection, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The government has deployed an emergency response team to the area and neighbouring countries have stepped up surveillance. No cases have yet been reported outside Kagera.

“The efforts by Tanzania’s health authorities to establish the cause of the disease is a clear indication of the determination to effectively respond to the outbreak,” said Matshidiso Moeti, WHO’s regional director for Africa. “We are working with the government to rapidly scale up control measures to halt the spread of the virus and end the outbreak as soon as possible.”

Patients displaying symptoms of the disease were first detected last week in two Kagera villages, according to a health memorandum on Tuesday by the Tanzanian health minister Ummy Mwalimu.

MVD was first discovered in 1967 in Marburg and Frankfurt in Germany and Belgrade, Serbia. It is from the same “virus family” as Ebola and causes a severe hemorrhagic fever, while fatality rates have varied from 24% to 88%. There have been several outbreaks since its discovery, with the worst being Angola in 2004-2005, where there were 252 cases and 227 deaths.

The virus is initially transmitted to people from fruit bats, and then from person to person through body fluids or contaminated objects. Family members and health workers are particularly vulnerable to infection.

Symptoms of the disease can range from fever, nausea and rash at the onset, to jaundice and severe weight loss as the disease progresses. It has an incubation period of up to 21 days.

There are no vaccines or treatments for the virus, but according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, alleviating symptoms by rehydration or managing the patient’s blood and oxygen levels, can increase the chances of survival.

The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) is also supporting efforts to contain the outbreak. Tanzania is battling the virus for the first time, just a month after Equatorial Guinea confirmed its first case.

“These emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases are a sign that the health security of the continent needs to be strengthened to cope with the disease threats,” said Ahmed Ogwell Ouma, the director of Africa CDC. “We urge members of the public to continue sharing information in a timely manner with the authorities to enable a most effective response.”

Tanzania’s health ministry has called on citizens to take general precaution and follow health directives until the situation is brought under control.","Tanzania has announced its first outbreak of the deadly Marburg virus disease (MVD), after five fatalities and three further cases were reported at a hospital in the country’s north-west Kagera region.
Through contact tracing, approximately 161 people have been identified as at risk of infection, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

The Physicians Committee of Responsible Medicine (PCRM) said in a letter to the U.S. Department of Transportation, which was shared with Reuters, that it has obtained emails and other documents that suggest unsafe packaging and movement of implants removed from the brains of monkeys. These implants may have carried infectious diseases in violation of federal law, PCRM said.

The letter said records that the group obtained showed instances of pathogens, such as antibiotic-resistant staphylococcus and herpes B virus, that may have been transported without proper containment measures.

PCRM's letter adds to the scrutiny facing Neuralink, which is developing a brain implant it hopes will help paralyzed people walk again and cure other neurological ailments.

In December, Reuters reported that Neuralink has been under a federal investigation over potential animal welfare violations and that some of its staff made internal complaints about experiments being rushed, causing needless suffering and deaths.

The incidents that involved potential breaches of hazardous material transportation regulations happened in 2019, when Neuralink relied on University of California, Davis to help carry out its experiments on primates, according to the documents cited by PCRM.

While Neuralink's partnership with UC Davis ended in 2020, PCRM said the company continues to employ the neurosurgeon who oversaw the experiments and other staff involved may also still be employed.

Reuters reviewed the UC Davis records cited by PCRM in its letter. It is unclear whether further records exist that provide a different or fuller account of what happened. PCRM obtained the records from UC Davis through public information requests. Neuralink messages and records not shared with UC Davis are not subject to such information requests.

Representatives for Neuralink, including Musk, and the Department of Transportation did not respond to comment requests. A UC Davis spokesperson would only say that the university abides by all biohazard and lab safety regulations.

PCRM's letter said pathogens were carried on removed implants from monkeys after improper sanitization and packaging. The group said those pathogens could cause serious health issues in infected humans, such as bloodstream infections, pneumonia and severe brain damage, among other problems.

PCRM, which opposes the use of animals in medical research, did not identify any harm as a result of these incidents, but said Neuralink's actions ""may pose a serious and ongoing public health risk.""

""The company's documented track record of sloppy, unsafe laboratory practices compel DOT to investigate and levy appropriate fines,"" PCRM said in the letter.

PCRM said it also found instances that appear to describe UC Davis employees urging immediate biohazard training for Neuralink employees following incidents that had caused contamination concerns. On one occasion in April 2019, a UC Davis employee wrote in an email that the university’s primate center is “at risk” for “monkey contaminated hardware.”

""This is an exposure to anyone coming in contact with the contaminated explanted hardware and we are making a big deal about this because we are concerned for human safety,"" wrote the employee, whose name was redacted from the records.

PCRM has raised concerns about Neuralink in the past. Last year, it wrote to federal officials about alleged animal-welfare issues during Neuralink’s research partnership with UC Davis, citing another set of records it obtained. A federal prosecutor in the Northern District of California referred PCRM's complaint to the USDA Inspector General, which later launched the federal probe into Neuralink, Reuters previously reported.

During its partnership with UC Davis, Neuralink grew frustrated with what it regarded as the slow pace of testing on primates, current and former company employees told Reuters, and has since built out extensive in-house animal testing facilities. The company has missed deadlines set by Musk to proceed to human trials, however. His pressure on Neuralink’s staff to make progress contributed to mistakes plaguing some experiments, Reuters reported.","Reuters reviewed the UC Davis records cited by PCRM in its letter.

The Russian offensive enters its 61th week, we track where the fighting is happening and how we got here.

Read on for an overview of the situation in infographics and maps.

Who controls what in Ukraine?

Mykola Oleshchuk, the commander of the Ukrainian air force, said Russia launched a drone attack on Odesa, hitting civilian infrastructure. Ukraine’s air defences destroyed 10 of 12 “kamikaze” drones, he said.

Who controls what in eastern Ukraine?

Russian forces conducted limited ground attacks near Kreminna and in and around Bakhmut, along the Avdiivka-Donetsk front line, and in western Donetsk Oblast, according to the Institute for the Study of War.

Who controls what in southern Ukraine?

Ukrainian forces conducted limited ground attacks in the Zaporizhia region, according to the Institute for the Study of War.

Where are people fleeing to?

According to the United Nations refugee agency, there have been 20.4 million border crossings out of Ukraine since the Russian invasion began in February 2022. Many people have sought refuge in neighbouring countries.

The latest data show 10,885,691 border crossings into Poland, 2,240,464 to Romania, 2,852,395 to Russia, 2,524,705 to Hungary, 1,313,431 to Slovakia, 802,705 to Moldova and 16,705 into Belarus. Most of those displaced have been women and children. Men aged 18 to 60 have been asked to remain in Ukraine to fight.

Ukraine and Russia explained in ten maps and charts

Below are ten infographics that break down the history, politics and economics of the Ukraine-Russia crisis.

1. Conflict at a glance

After months of tensions and intense diplomacy, Russian forces invaded Ukraine. Explosions were heard across the country. Kyiv declared martial law, saying Ukraine will defend itself. Below is a summary of the conflict at a glance.

2. History of the USSR

Russia and Ukraine were part of the 15 Soviet republics that made up the Soviet Union. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine declared independence on August 24. The map below shows when each of these countries declared independence.

3. Political leadership

After independence, Ukraine moved to shed its Russian imperial legacy and forge increasingly close ties with the West.

Over the past 30 years, Ukraine has been led by seven presidents. The country has had a rocky path towards democracy with two revolutions, first in 2005 and then in 2014. Both times, protesters rejected Russia’s supremacy and sought a path to join the European Union and NATO.

By comparison, Russia has been led by three presidents, with Putin having been in office for 17 years. In 2021, Putin, the former agent of the Soviet Union’s KGB security services, signed a law that essentially enables him to stay in power until 2036.

Putin has repeatedly claimed that Russians and Ukrainians belong to “one people” and are part of the historical “Russian civilisation” that also includes neighbouring Belarus. Ukrainians reject his claims.

4. How big are Ukraine and Russia?

Ukraine has an estimated population of 44 million – the seventh-largest in Europe. The country comprises 24 regions, known as oblasts. The country’s population has declined since the 1990s with fertility rates among the lowest in the world. As of 2020, Ukraine’s fertility rate was just 1.2. For context, in order for a population to remain stable, an overall total fertility rate of 2.1 is required.

Ukraine is the second-largest country in Europe, after Russia. At 603,550sq km (233,031sq miles), Ukraine is a bit smaller than the US state of Texas, about three times smaller than India, half the size of South Africa and about two and a half times the size of the United Kingdom.

5. NATO in Europe

NATO is the world’s most powerful military alliance. Comprising 30 nations, its primary role is to protect its member states by political and military means.

Russia opposes NATO bases near its borders and has asked for written guarantees that NATO will not expand eastwards. One of the Kremlin’s central demands is that Ukraine never be allowed to join NATO – a move it considers a red line. The United States has refused to concede to this demand.

Read more about NATO history and expansion here.

6. Military head to head

Russia has one of the most powerful militaries in the world and ranks among the top five defence spenders.

In 2020, Russia spent $61.7bn on its military, which accounted for 11.4 percent of government spending. In comparison, Ukraine spent $5.9bn on its armed forces, or 8.8 percent of government spending, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.

Since tensions began, NATO allies, fearful of a potential ground invasion by Russia, have stepped up support for Kyiv by sending military equipment to Ukraine.

Read more about the military capabilities of Russia and Ukraine here.

7. Oil and gas resources

Russia and Ukraine are both rich in oil and gas. Russia has the world’s highest proven gas reserves at 48,938 billion cubic metres. More than 70 percent of the country’s gas reserves are held by Gazprom, a state-owned energy giant.

Russia supplies about one-third of Europe’s natural gas. US sanctions over the conflict could disrupt that supply, exacerbating Europe’s energy crisis. On February 22, Germany halted the certification of Nord Stream 2, an $11.6bn Russian gas pipeline project that was designed to move 151 million cubic metres of gas a day into Europe.

Russia also has some of the largest proven oil reserves, at 80 billion barrels, or 5 percent of the world’s total.

Ukraine, too, has a sizeable reserve of oil and gas at 395 million barrels and 349 billion cubic metres, respectively. The country sits at the crossroads between the West and Russia, and plays a key role in delivering Russian gas to European markets.

Read more about the world’s oil and gas pipelines here.

8. Russia and Ukraine’s main exports

More than one-quarter of the world’s wheat exports come from Russia and Ukraine. Economic sanctions or military action may have a significant effect on the cost of food as importers seek to find alternatives. Russia exported $407bn in products and Ukraine $49bn in 2019.

Read more about Russia, Ukraine and the global wheat supply here.

9. Which countries rely most on Russian oil?

In 2019, the world’s top exporters of crude oil were Saudi Arabia ($145bn), Russia ($123bn), Iraq ($73.8bn), Canada ($67.8bn), and the US ($61.9bn).

China bought about one-quarter (27 percent) of Russia’s total oil exports worth $34bn. However, given China’s massive energy needs, this made up only 16 percent of the country’s oil imports.

At least 48 countries imported Russian crude oil in 2019. The countries that rely most on Russian oil include: Belarus, Cuba, Curacao, Kazakhstan, Latvia – each importing more than 99 percent of their crude oil from Russia.

The graphic below shows how much of each country’s total crude oil imports come from Russia.

10. Which countries buy the most Russian weapons?

Russia is the world’s second-largest arms exporter, behind the United States, accounting for roughly 20 percent of global weapons sales. Between 2016 and 2020, Moscow sold $28bn of weapons to 45 countries.

Russia exports nearly 90 percent of its arms to 10 countries. Its biggest customer, India, bought 23 percent of Russia’s weapons for some $6.5bn over the past five years. Half of India’s total arms imports, 49.3 percent, come from Russia.

China is the second-largest buyer of Russian weaponry at $5.1bn over the same period followed by Algeria ($4.2bn), Egypt ($3.3bn), and Vietnam ($1.7bn), according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).

UKB is a UK population study of approximately 500,000 participants aged 40–69 years at recruitment2. Participant data (with informed consent) include genomic, electronic health record linkage, blood, urine and infection biomarkers, physical and anthropometric measurements, imaging data and various other intermediate phenotypes that are constantly being updated. Further details are available at https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/showcase/. Analyses in this study were conducted under UK Biobank Approved Project number 26041. Ethic protocols are provided by the UK Biobank Ethics Advisory Committee (https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/learn-more-about-uk-biobank/about-us/ethics).

FG is a public-private partnership project combining electronic health record and registry data from six regional and three Finnish biobanks. Participant data (with informed consent) include genomics and health records linked to disease endpoints. Further details are available at https://www.finngen.fi/. More details on FG and ethics protocols are provided in Supplementary Information. We used data from FG participants with completed genetic measurements (R5 data release) and imputation (R6 data release). FinnGen participants provided informed consent for biobank research. Recruitment protocols followed the biobank protocols approved by Fimea, the National Supervisory Authority for Welfare and Health. The Coordinating Ethics Committee of the Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa (HUS) approved the FinnGen study protocol Nr HUS/990/2017. The FinnGen study is approved by Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare.

Disease phenotypes

FG phenotypes were automatically mapped to those used in the Pan UKBB (https://pan.ukbb.broadinstitute.org/) project. Pan UKBB phenotypes are a combination of Phecodes37 and ICD10 codes. Phecodes were translated to ICD10 (https://phewascatalog.org/phecodes_icd10, v.2.1) and mapping was based on ICD-10 definitions for FG endpoints obtained from cause of death, hospital discharge and cancer registries. For disease definition consistency, we reproduced the same Phecode maps using the same ICD-10 definitions in UKB. In particular, we expertly curated 15 neurological phenotypes using ICD10 codes. We retained phenotypes where the similarity score (Jaccard index: ICD10 FG ∩ ICD10 UKB / ICD10 FG ∪ ICD10 UKB ) was >0.7 and additionally excluded spontaneous deliveries and abortions.

Phecodes and ICD10 coded phenotypes were first mapped to unified disease names and disease groups using mappings from Phecode, PheWAS and icd R packages followed by manual curation of unmapped traits and diseases groups, mismatched and duplicate entries. Disease endpoints were mapped to Experimental Factor Ontology (EFO) terms using mappings from EMBL-EBI and Open Targets based on exact disease entry matches followed by manual curation of unmapped traits.

Disease trait clusters were determined through first calculating the phenotypic similarity via the cosine similarity, then determining clusters via hierarchical clustering on the distance matrix (1-similarity) using the Ward algorithm and cutting the hierarchical tree, after inspection, at height 0.8 to provide the most semantically meaningful clusters.

Genetic data processing

UKB genetic QC

UKB genotyping and imputation were performed as described previously2. Whole-exome sequencing data for UKB participants were generated at the Regeneron Genetics Center (RGC) as part of a collaboration between AbbVie, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, AstraZeneca, Biogen, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Pfizer, Regeneron and Takeda with the UK Biobank. Whole-exome sequencing data were processed using the RGC SBP pipeline as described3,38. RGC generated a QC-passing ‘Goldilocks’ set of genetic variants from a total of 454,803 sequenced UK Biobank participants for analysis. Additional quality control (QC) steps were performed prior to association analyses as detailed below.

FG genetic QC

Samples were genotyped with Illumina and Affymetrix arrays (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Genotype calls were made with GenCall and zCall algorithms for Illumina and AxiomGT1 algorithm for Affymetrix data. Sample, genotyping as well as imputation procedures and QC are detailed in Supplementary Information.

Coding variant selection

GnomAD v.2.0 variant annotations were used for FinnGen variants39. The following gnomAD annotation categories are included: pLOF, low-confidence loss-of-function (LC), in-frame insertion–deletion, missense, start lost, stop lost, stop gained. Variants have been filtered to imputation INFO score > 0.6. Additional variant annotations were performed using variant effect predictor (VEP)40 with SIFT and PolyPhen scores averaged across the canonical annotations.

Disease endpoint association analyses

For optimized meta-analyses with FG, analyses in UKB were performed in the subset of exome-sequence UKB participants with white European ancestry for consistency with FG (n = 392,814). We used REGENIE v1.0.6.7 for association analyses via a two-step procedure as detailed in ref. 41. In brief, the first step fits a whole genome regression model for individual trait predictions based on genetic data using the leave one chromosome out (LOCO) scheme. We used a set of high-quality genotyped variants: MAF > 5%, MAC > 100, genotyping rate >99%, Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) test p > 10−15, <5% missingness and linkage-disequilibrium pruning (1,000 variant windows, 100 sliding windows and r2 < 0.8). Traits where the step 1 regression failed to converge due to case imbalances were subsequently excluded from subsequent analyses. The LOCO phenotypic predictions were used as offsets in step 2 which performs variant association analyses using the approximate Firth regression detailed in ref. 41 when the P value from the standard logistic regression score test is below 0.01. Standard errors were computed from the effect size estimate and the likelihood ratio test P-value. To avoid issues related to severe case imbalance and extremely rare variants, we limited association test to phenotypes with >100 cases and for variants with MAC ≥ 5 in total samples and MAC ≥ 3 in cases and controls. The number of variants used for analyses varies for different diseases as a result of the MAC cut-off for different disease prevalence. The association models in both steps also included the following covariates: age, age2, sex, age*sex, age2*sex, first 10 genetic principal components (PCs).

Association analyses in FG were performed using mixed model logistic regression method SAIGE v0.3942. Age, sex, 10 PCs and genotyping batches were used as covariates. For null model computation for each endpoint each genotyping batch was included as a covariate for an endpoint if there were at least 10 cases and 10 controls in that batch to avoid convergence issues. One genotyping batch need be excluded from covariates to not have them saturated. We excluded Thermo Fisher batch 16 as it was not enriched for any particular endpoints. For calculating the genetic relationship matrix, only variants imputed with an INFO score >0.95 in all batches were used. Variants with >3% missing genotypes were excluded as well as variants with MAF < 1%. The remaining variants were linkage-disequilibrium pruned with a 1-Mb window and r2 threshold of 0.1. This resulted in a set of 59,037 well-imputed not rare variants for GRM calculation. SAIGE options for null computation were: “LOCO=false, numMarkers=30, traceCVcutoff=0.0025, ratioCVcutoff=0.001”. Association tests were performed phenotypes with case counts >100 and for variants with minimum allele count of 3 and imputation INFO >0.6 were used.

We additionally performed sex-specific associations for a subset of gender-specific diseases (60 female diseases and in 50 disease clusters, 14 male diseases and in 13 disease clusters) in both FG and UKB using the same approach without inclusion of sex-related covariates (Supplementary Table 2)

We performed fixed-effect inverse-variance meta-analysis combining summary effect sizes and standard errors for overlapping variants with matched alleles across FG and UKB using METAL43.

Definition and refinement of significant regions

To define significance, we used a combination of (1) multiple testing corrected threshold of P < 2 × 10−9 (that is, 0.05/(approximately 26.8 × 106), the sum of the mean number of variants tested per disease cluster)), to account for the fact that some traits are highly correlated disease subtypes, (2) concordant direction of effect between UKB and FG associations, and (3) P < 0.05 in both UKB and FG.

We defined independent trait associations through linkage-disequilibrium-based (r2 = 0.1) clumping ±500 kb around the lead variants using PLINK44, excluding the HLA region (chr6:25.5-34.0Mb) which is treated as one region due to complex and extensive linkage-disequilibrium patterns. We then merged overlapping independent regions (±500 kb) and further restricted each independent variant (r2 = 0.1) to the most significant sentinel variant for each unique gene. For overlapping genetic regions that are associated with multiple disease endpoints (pleiotropy), to be conservative in reporting the number of associations we merged the overlapping (independent) regions to form a single distinct region (indexed by the region ID column in Supplementary Table 3).

Cross-reference with known associations

We cross-referenced the sentinel variants and their proxies (r2 > 0.2) for significant associations (P < 5 × 10−8) of mapped EFO terms and their descendants in GWAS Catalog11 and PhenoScanner12. To be more conservative with reporting of novel associations, we also considered whether the most-severe associated gene in our analyses were reported in GWAS Catalog and PhenoScanner. In addition, we also queried our sentinel variants in ClinVar13 to define known associations with rarer genetic diseases and further manually curated novel associations (where the association is a novel variant association and a novel gene association) for previous genome-wide significant (P < 5 × 10−8) associations.

To assess medical actionability of associated genes, we cross-referenced the associated genes with the latest ACMG v3. (75 unique genes linked to 82 conditions, linked to cancer (n = 28), cardiovascular (n = 34), metabolic (n = 3), or miscellaneous conditions (n = 8)). This list was supplemented by 20 ‘ACMG watchlist genes’14 for which evidence for inclusion to ACMG 3.0 list was considered too preliminary based on either technical, penetrance or clinical management concerns

Biomarker associations of lead variants

For the lead sentinel variants, we performed association analyses using the two-step REGENIE approach described above with 117 biomarkers including anthropometric traits, physical measurements, clinical haematology measurements, blood and urine biomarkers available in UKB (detailed in Supplementary Table 8). Additional biochemistry subgroupings were based on UKB biochemistry subcategories: https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/media/oiudpjqa/bcm023_ukb_biomarker_panel_website_v1-0-aug-2015-edit-2018.pdf

Drug target mapping and enrichment

We mapped the annotated gene for each sentinel variant to drugs using the therapeutic target database (TTD)21. We retained only drugs which have been approved or are in clinical trial stages. For enrichment analysis of approved drugs with genetic associations, we used Fisher’s exact test on the proportion of significant genes targeted by approved drug against a background of all approved drugs in TTD21 (n = 595) and 20,437 protein coding genes from Ensembl annotations45.

Mendelian randomization analyses

F5 and F10 effects on pulmonary embolism

The missense variants rs4525 and rs61753266 in F5 and F10 genes were taken as genetic instruments for Mendelian randomization analyses. To assess potential that each factor level is causally associated with pulmonary embolism we used two-sample Mendelian randomization using summary statistics, with effect of the variants on their respective factor levels obtained from previous large scale (protein quantitative trait loci) pQTL studies46,47. Let \({\beta }_{{XY}}\) denote the estimated causal effect of a factor level on pulmonary embolism risk and \({\beta }_{X}\), \({\beta }_{Y}\) be the genetic association with a factor level (FV, FX or FXa) and pulmonary embolism risk respectively. Then, the Mendelian randomization ratio-estimate of \({\beta }_{{XY}}\) is given by:

$${\beta }_{{XY}}=\frac{{\beta }_{Y}}{{\beta }_{X}}$$

where the corresponding standard error \({\rm{se}}({\beta }_{{XY}})\), computed to leading order, is:

$${\rm{se}}({\beta }_{{XY}})=\frac{{\rm{se}}({\beta }_{Y})}{\left|{\beta }_{X}\right|}$$

Clustered Mendelian randomization

To assess evidence of several distinct causal mechanisms by which AF may influence pulse rate (PR) we used MR-Clust31. In brief, MR-Clust is a purpose-built clustering algorithm for use in univariate Mendelian randomization analyses. It extends the typical Mendelian randomization assumption that a risk factor can influence an outcome via a single causal mechanism48 to a framework that allows one or more mechanisms to be detected. When a risk-factor affects an outcome via several mechanisms, the set of two-stage ratio-estimates can be divided into clusters, such that variants within each cluster have similar ratio-estimates. As shown in31, two or more variants are members of the same cluster if and only if they affect the outcome via the same distinct causal pathway. Moreover, the estimated causal effect from a cluster is proportional to the total causal effect of the mechanism on the outcome. We included variants within clusters where the probability of inclusion >0.7. We used MR-Clust algorithm allowing for singletons/outlier variants to be identified as their own ‘clusters’ to reflect the large but biologically plausible effect sizes seen with rare and low-frequency variants.

Bioinformatic analyses for METTL11B

We searched [Ala/Pro/Ser]-Pro-Lys motif containing proteins using the ‘peptide search’ function on UniProt49, filtering for reviewed Swiss-Prot proteins and proteins listed in Human Protein Atlas50 (HPA) (n = 7,656). We obtained genes with elevated expression in cardiomyocytes (n = 880) from HPA based on the criteria: ‘cell_type_category_rna: cardiomyocytes; cell type enriched, group enriched, cell type enhanced’ as defined by HPA at https://www.proteinatlas.org/humanproteome/celltype/Muscle+cells#cardiomyocytes (accessed 20th March 2021) with filtering for those with valid UniProt IDs (Swiss-Prot, n = 863). Enrichment test was performed using Fisher’s exact test. Additionally, we performed enrichment analyses using any [Ala/Pro/Ser]-Pro-Lys motif positioned within the N-terminal half of the protein (n = 4,786).

Additional methods Additional methods on further FinnGen QC; theoretical description and simulation of the effect of MAF enrichment on inverse-variance weighted (IVW) meta-analysis Z-scores; and functional characterization of PITX2c(Pro41Ser) are provided in the Supplementary Information.

He added: “Make no mistake that violence against civilians continues across the country, from bombardment in the northwest, north and northeast, to targeted killings, unlawful detention and torture…These are the abysses faced by the Syrian people.”

According to the report, covering the period July to December 2021, there were increased bombardments in the northwest of the country and skirmishes between the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) and the Syrian Democratic Forces in the northeast.

The Commission documented “grave violations of fundamental human rights and international humanitarian law by parties to the conflict, including war crimes and ongoing patterns of crimes against humanity.

“In Idlib and western Aleppo in the northwest, residential areas were also shelled indiscriminately from the ground by pro-government forces.”

Ukraine food factor

Previous reports by the Commission of Inquiry have warned about a worsening humanitarian situation across Syria because of fighting and insecurity, but Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February has heightened concerns that critical wheat imports may now be affected, said Commissioner Hanny Megally: “We’re already seeing inflation at 140 per cent at the beginning of this year (and) it’s gone up.

“We’re seeing the State already beginning to ration. We’re seeing the prices of commodities, basic commodities and fuel going up…Most of Syria’s imported wheat is coming from Ukraine or Russia, so we are very concerned that the war in Ukraine will have a bad impact on Syria.”

Sanctions review

With Syria “teetering on collapse”, the Commissioners urged a review of sanctions imposed on Syria on a country-by-country basis.

“Sanctions …should facilitate humanitarian assistance (but) this is not really working very well,” said Mr. Megally, who warned that many countries were so fearful of breaching the embargoes that they were practising “overcompliance”, leaving Syrian communities short of essential commodities.

Findings from the latest report from the Commission of Inquiry include 14 attacks “by Syrian and Russian forces in northwest Syria”, Mr. Pinheiro said.

“Over these past few months, scores of children were killed, including on their way to school; and the last functional medical centre in Jabal al Zawiya was rendered inoperable.”

Festering conditions in Al-Hol

Longstanding concerns also remain over the detention in Al Hol camp of tens of thousands of women and children, believed to be the families of former ISIL fighters, in Syria’s northeast.

“The conditions in Al Hol are absolutely appalling, and the number of children and other numbers of mostly women who are detained-cum-interned there,” said Commissioner Lynn Welchman of the notorious camp complex in Syria’s northeast.

“It’s a dreadful situation, humanitarian-wise and security-wise. And it’s one of the things that we are most concerned about in terms of what’s happened…In some cases, it could at least be addressed by third nations who are able to take back their nationals, with their children.”

The Commission of Inquiry has repeatedly called for UN Member States to repatriate nationals who went to participate in the Syrian conflict.

“The camp residents are under constant risk of being injured, killed, or trafficked. More than 90 murders and 40 attempted murders have occurred in Al Hol alone in the past year,” said Mr. Pinheiro. “We are repeating our call for Member States to bring home their women and children from the camps.”","Tweet URL @UNCoISyria releasing latest report: https://t.co/UTQ3WxDoIw pic.twitter.com/JW1qlwoTJf UN Syria Commission UNCoISyriaAlthough parts of Syria are no longer subject to active fighting, communities remain caught between warring parties and exploited by armed actors, Mr. Pinheiro said.

According to researchers at the University of California San Diego, doing jobs on your feet (like prepping meals or cleaning) can lower the risk of cardiovascular disease by 43%, reduce heart disease (43%), lower the risk of stroke (30%) and lower the chance of dying from heart disease by 62%. Housework might not be considered physical activity, but these findings show just how beneficial it is to keep moving.

In the study, experts looked at how women spent their day, including standing still, sitting down, walking, running or sitting in a car. Each person was given a research-grade accelerometer to get accurate measures of how much time they spent moving over seven days. Interestingly, those that were up and about more doing household activities had lower risks.

""The study demonstrates that all movement counts towards disease prevention,"" lead author on the paper, Dr Steve Nguyen, told The Evening Standard. ""Spending more time in daily life movement, which includes a wide range of activities we all do while on our feet and out of our chairs, resulted in a lower risk of cardiovascular disease.""

Researcher Dr Andrea LaCroix adds: ""Much of the movement engaged in by older adults is associated with daily life tasks, but it may not be considered physical activity. Understanding the benefits of daily life movement and adding this to physical activity guidelines may encourage more movement.""

569,569,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/autos/going-change-auto-industry-2022-rcna10350,What's ahead for the auto industry in 2022?,"From shortages of crucial semiconductor chips to shutdowns at major assembly plants, as well as skyrocketing car prices and empty dealerships, 2021 was a year to remember for auto manufacturers and consumers alike. But there were also a surge in sales of electric vehicles and an increasing shift from sedans to SUVs and pickup trucks.

So what’s ahead for 2022? By some accounts, it may be more of the same, as shortages continue to leave dealers struggling for inventory and consumers facing ever higher prices. But shoppers will also find a lot more options if they’re looking for electric vehicles.

Here are the storylines we expect will dominate this year:

Ongoing product shortages

As Covid-19 struck, automakers slashed production and parts orders. But when sales started to rebound, they discovered they couldn’t get all the semiconductors they needed, leading to major production cuts. The industry lost around $210 billion in revenue in 2021, according to AlixPartners, a business management consultancy. While chip supplies are loosening up, they’re far from back to normal, and production cut be hurt well into 2022. Worse, the industry faces other shortages affecting products like tires and interior plastics and seat foams.

Higher prices for new cars

All told, automakers worldwide produced about 8 million fewer vehicles than planned last year because of product shortages. Even if production rebounds, dealers won't be able to build back inventories until well into 2022, J.D. Power analyst Tyson Jominy said. As a result, buyers should expect limited choices — while prices will continue to rise at a record rate. At the end of 2021, a typical new vehicle cost $45,000, up about $8,000 from December 2020, according to industry data.

Normalization of online car buying

When the U.S. went into lockdown, the industry hit upon a novel idea. Because customers couldn’t go to dealers, dealers went to them — over the internet. Even after the country opened back up, more and more customers are shopping for their cars online, and many retailers schedule test drives and deliver new vehicles to buyers’ homes or offices. Meanwhile, with showroom lots nearly bare, normally impulse-driven motorists have begun ordering their cars and waiting — sometimes for months — to take delivery.

EVs start their move into pole position

They account for a modest fraction of U.S. new vehicle sales, but demand for battery-electric vehicles doubled during just the first half of 2021. This year could bring the “tipping point,” GM CEO Mary Barra said, with the EV market exploding. Several factors will play a role, starting with a plethora of new offerings: Analysts anticipate the number of long-range models will quadruple this year.

The impact of Build Back Better

President Joe Biden has put a lot of emphasis on the auto industry. In December, the White House announced its most aggressive fuel economy standards, and Biden has said he wants to see EVs account for up to 50 percent of U.S. sales by 2030. His infrastructure bill delivers funds for a nationwide charging network. But other funds, including money to boost EV sales incentives, are currently stalled in Congress.

Startups will continue to shake things up

The automotive industry was a largely closed club since World War II, but Tesla showed it’s possible to crack the code. Now, other start-ups want to share in its success. Wall Street has rewarded several of the most promising players. Rivian now has a market cap of over $90 billion, more than either Ford or General Motors. But others, like Byton, Lordstown Motors and Faraday Future are struggling and could fall aside in 2022.

Tesla takes some heat

At first glance, 2022 should be a good year for Tesla after setting sales and earnings records in 2021. The California-based electric vehicle manufacturer has two new plants, one in Austin, Texas; and the other in Berlin. But several key products, including the Cybertruck, are well behind schedule, as are the next-gen batteries Tesla is counting on. Tesla is under pressure from the Chinese government and facing more safety probes by U.S. regulators.

Autonomous vehicles could stall

Automakers once promised to have a fully self-driving vehicle ready by 2020. However, 2022 could see some breakthroughs. GM and Mercedes-Benz are set to roll out the first true hands-free — Level 3 in industry-speak — driving technology for consumers. Others, like Waymo and Cruise, are focusing on ride-sharing services and cargo haulers. But safety probes involving Tesla’s Autopilot serve as a cautionary note about just how difficult a challenge it is to develop a fully autonomous vehicle.

China edges closer

China is the world’s largest auto market, but domestic manufacturers like Geely and Great Wall want to reach beyond its borders. Efforts to enter the U.S., the No. 2 global market, have repeatedly been delayed, however. Trade frictions during the Trump administration have yet to be resolved under President Joe Biden. So while a handful of Chinese-made products are available in U.S. showrooms, including the Buick Envision and the Polestar 2, a real automotive invasion could be years off.","So what’s ahead for 2022?

574,574,https://www.healthline.com/health/is-ibd-an-autoimmune-disease,Is IBD an Autoimmune Disease?,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) includes two conditions that cause chronic, or long-lasting, inflammation in your gastrointestinal (GI) tract. These two conditions are called Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 1.3 percent of adults in the United States had IBD in 2015. This is about 3 million people. Researchers don’t know what exactly causes IBD to develop. What they do know is that a dysfunctional immune response leads to the increased levels of inflammation in the GI tract. But is IBD an autoimmune disease? While it has similarities with autoimmune diseases, IBD is a little different. Keep reading below as we take a deeper dive into IBD, the immune system, and what we know so far.

IBD and the immune system IBD falls under the umbrella of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs). Generally speaking, IMIDs are conditions in which chronic inflammation happens due to an atypical immune response. In addition to IBD, autoimmune disease is another type of IMID. Asthma and other allergic conditions can also be classified as IMIDs. Autoimmune diseases are characterized by an inappropriate immune response to healthy organs and tissues in the body. For example, many people with RA have autoantibodies that attack healthy joint tissue. IBD is a little different. IBD is generally accepted to be caused by an atypical immune response to environmental triggers in a genetically susceptible person. This leads to chronic inflammation in the GI tract and the symptoms of IBD, which can include: abdominal pain

frequent diarrhea, which may include mucus or blood

unintentional weight loss

fatigue

low grade fever What’s up with the immune system? You may not think about it this way, but your GI tract contains a lot of potential antigens. These include the food you eat, some of the medications you take, and healthy bacteria called commensals. Commensals are important for your GI health. For example, they aid with digestion and help to protect your GI tract from disease-causing germs. They also play a role in immune system development. Usually, your immune system tolerates the factors we’ve mentioned above. That means it typically sees them as harmless and leaves them alone. However, in IBD, a trigger causes the immune system to mount a response against factors that are typically harmless, such as commensals. This leads to increased, persistent inflammation in the affected part of the GI tract. The lining of the GI tract also becomes compromised in IBD. This means that immune cells can flood into the area in an effort to eliminate what’s mistakenly seen as a threat. This causes further inflammation and damage. An imbalance of bacteria, called dysbiosis, also happens in people with IBD. Whether dysbiosis is a cause or effect of IBD is unknown. Regardless, changes in the types of bacteria in the GI tract may also affect immune activity and inflammation.

Does IBD increase risk of autoimmune disease? Both IBD and autoimmune disease are IMIDs. As such, many of the ways that they cause disease may overlap. If this is the case, could having IBD put you at an increased risk of developing an autoimmune disease? While additional studies are needed, some research indicates that having IBD increases the risk of autoimmune disease. Let’s take a look at some examples. A 2016 study found that, compared with people without IBD, those with IBD had a higher incidence of autoimmune disease. Severe IBD was associated with an increased risk of developing autoimmune disease. A 2017 study had similar findings. Researchers found that 20 different IMIDs were more common in people with IBD, including: type 1 diabetes

RA

psoriasis

celiac disease

asthma

IBD and COVID-19 IBD doesn’t raise your risk of contracting the novel coronavirus or becoming seriously ill with COVID-19. However, if you have IBD, keeping it in remission is important during this time. This means carefully sticking to your treatment plan. Regardless of when it occurs, an IBD relapse can further damage your GI tract. Additionally, if you need medical care for a relapse during the pandemic, it’s possible that medical resources may be limited. This will depend on the level of COVID-19 activity in your area. Because some IBD medications can weaken your immune response, you may have concerns about taking your IBD medications during the pandemic. According to the Crohn’s and Colitis Foundation, people with IBD should continue to take IBD medications as directed by their doctors. Discuss any concerns about IBD medications in relation to the pandemic with a doctor. If you test positive for the coronavirus or become ill with COVID-19, it’s possible that you may need to temporarily stop taking certain medications until you recover. Never make any adjustments to your medications without consulting your doctor.

Treatment and management of IBD The goal of IBD treatment is to lower inflammation in your GI tract, which will keep you in remission and prevent the disease from progressing. Medications are often an important part of IBD treatment. Several types of medications may be used to treat IBD, including: aminosalicylates like mesalamine and sulfasalazine

corticosteroids like prednisone

immunosuppressant drugs like azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine

biologics like adalimumab (Humira) and infliximab (Remicade) Additionally, other interventions can help manage IBD, including: bowel rest for severe Crohn’s disease

surgery to remove parts of your GI tract that have been severely affected by IBD

dietary adjustments like: avoiding foods that trigger symptoms eating smaller meals more frequently using nutritional supplements if you’re not receiving enough nutrients

The full protocol for RADAR-MDD has been reported elsewhere [18]. In short, RADAR-MDD is a multi-centre, prospective observational cohort study. The study aimed to examine whether data collected via multiparametric RMT can be used to reliably track illness course and predict relapse in MDD. The study sought to recruit 600 individuals with a recent history of recurrent MDD (with the latest episode within the past 2 years) and follow them up for a maximum of 24 months. The study has three recruitment sites: King’s College London (KCL, UK), Amsterdam University Medical Centre (VUmc. Amsterdam, The Netherlands), and Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red (CIBER; Barcelona, Spain).

Study population

To be eligible for participation in RADAR-MDD, individuals must: 1) have met DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for non-psychotic MDD within the past 2 years; 2) have recurrent MDD (having had a lifetime history of at least 2 episodes); 3) be able and willing to complete self-reported assessments via smartphone; 4) be able to give informed consent; 5) be fluent in English, Dutch, Spanish or Catalan; 5) have an existing Android smartphone, or willingness to swap to Android as their only phone; 6) be aged 18 or over. Depression diagnosis was determined using the Lifetime Depression Assessment – Self-Report (LIDAS; [22]) in addition to the review of medical records.

Exclusion criteria were: 1) having a self-reported lifetime history of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, MDD with psychotic features, or schizoaffective disorder; 2) dementia; 3) having received treatment for drug or alcohol use in the 6 months prior to enrolment; 4) a major medical diagnosis which might impact an individual’s ability to participate in normal daily activities for more than 2 weeks; 5) pregnancy (although once enrolled, becoming pregnant did not result in withdrawal as pre-pregnancy baseline data had already been obtained).

Eligible participants were identified via several recruitment channels, including through existing research cohorts who have consented to be contacted for future research opportunities (in the UK [23] and the Netherlands), through primary and secondary mental health services (in the UK and Barcelona), or through advertisements for the study placed on mental health charity websites, circulars or Twitter notices (at all sites). Participants in Amsterdam were partially recruited through Hersenonderzoek.nl (https://hersenonderzoek.nl/). All participants provided written consent and provided detailed baseline assessments including sociodemographic, social environment, medical history, medical comorbidities and technology use questionnaires.

Data collection

Remote data collection

Data collection started in London (UK) in November 2017 in a pilot phase of app development, with additional assessments being added to the protocol throughout the first 18 months of the study period to allow small-scale functionality testing and quality control before international large-scale data collection commenced. Data collection started in Barcelona and Amsterdam in September 2018 and February 2019, respectively. The data collected used RADAR-base, an open-source platform designed to leverage data from wearables and mobile technologies [24]. RADAR-base provides both passive and active data collection via two apps – the RADAR active and passive monitoring apps.

Passive RMT

The passive RMT (pRMT) app unobtrusively collected information about phone usage throughout participation, requiring no input from the participant. It collected data on ambient noise, ambient light, location, app usage, Bluetooth connectivity, phone usage, and battery life. Some data sources were removed from the protocol throughout follow-up (summarised in Supplementary file 1) due to unavoidable changes in smartphone operating systems. Changes to Google’s Play Store permissions prevented access to text and call log data as of January 2019. Data pertaining to text and call logs have not been reported in the current paper due to data collection from this sensor ceasing when one site had only recruited 30 individuals and another site had not started recruitment at all. Participants were additionally asked to wear a Fitbit Charge 2/3 device for the duration of participation, providing information about individuals’ sleep and physical activity levels. Participants could keep the Fitbit at the end of the time in the study.

Active RMT

The RADAR-base active RMT (aRMT) app administered validated measurements of depression and self-esteem every 2-weeks via the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ8; [25] and Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES; 26). Items on the PHQ8 can be totalled and used as a continuous score with higher scores indicating increased depression severity, and scores totalling ≥10 indicating those with significant symptoms [25]. The RSES requires reversing of 5 of the 10 items, which then can be totalled to create a total score with higher scores representing increased self-esteem [26].

The aRMT app also delivered a speech task every 2-weeks, requesting participants to record a pre-determined text from the “North Wind and the Sun” (see Supplementary file 2), an Aesop’s fable which is phonetically balanced across all three languages and has been shown to provide linguistic parameters indicative of low mood [27]. Participants were also asked to provide a sample of speech in answer a question relating to plans for the upcoming week. Finally, the aRMT app included an ESM protocol [18], requiring participants to complete brief questions relating to mood, stress, sociability, activity and sleep, multiple times per day for 6 days at scheduled times throughout the course of follow-up.

Cognitive function

Cognitive function was measured every 6-weeks via an additional THINC-it app®, which was integrated into the RADAR-base platform. The app has been validated to identify cognitive dysfunction within the context of depressive disorder [28]. The app contains the 5-item Perceived Deficits Questionnaire (PDQ-5; [29]), alongside computerised versions of the Choice Reaction Time Identification Task (“Code Breaker”), One-Back Test (“Spotter”), Digit Symbol Substitution Test (“Symbol Check”) and Trail Making Test-Part B (“Trails”) tasks to assess processing speed, working memory, concentration and attention [28].

Primary and secondary outcome assessments

All primary and secondary outcome measurements were collected via automatic surveys sent every 3 months via the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) software [30]. A full description of the outcome assessment schedule is provided in our published protocol paper [18].

Depression

Depressive state was measured using the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology – Self Report (IDS-SR; [31]) to capture changes in symptom severity, and the World Health Organisation’s Composite Diagnostic Interview – Short Form (CIDI-SF; [32]) to identify people meeting DSM-5 criteria for MDD at each timepoint. These two measurements were used to identify different operationalisations of depression across follow-up, summarised in Supplementary file 3. Briefly, participants were categorised as being “symptomatic” (scoring ≥26 on the IDS-SR and meeting CIDI-SF criteria for MDD), having “some symptoms” (scoring ≤25 on the IDS-SR and meeting CIDI-SF criteria for MDD; or > 21 on the IDS-SR and not meeting CIDI-SF criteria for MDD) or having “no/mild symptoms” (scoring ≤21 on the IDS-SR and not meeting CIDI-SF criteria for MDD).

As described previously [18], the primary outcome of interest in RADAR-MDD is depressive relapse, defined here as switching from a state of “no/mild symptoms” to “symptomatic” over a period of 6-months. Secondary depression outcomes are: remission (switching from a state of “symptomatic” to “no/mild symptoms” over a period of 6-months); and change in the severity of depressive symptoms (measured via the continuous IDS-SR).

Anxiety

Anxiety was measured via the 7-item Generalised Anxiety Disorder questionnaire (GAD7; [33]), used as a continuous indicator of anxiety symptom severity (a total of 21, with higher scores indicating increased anxiety severity) and a total score ≥ 10 indicating significant symptoms. This threshold has previously been shown to have good levels of sensitivity and specificity [34].

Functional ability

Functional ability was measured using the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS; [35]), using a continuous score from 0 to 40 to describe the level of impairment, with scores of 0–10, 11–20 and > 20 to indicate no, some and significant impairment respectively [35].

Alcohol use

The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT; [36]) was used to measure alcohol use across timepoints. A total score out of 40 describes the level of alcohol use; scores of 0–7 indicate low risk alcohol consumption; 8–15 indicate hazardous alcohol consumption; 16–19 indicate harmful alcohol consumption; and scores > 20 indicate likely alcohol dependence [37].

Illness perceptions

The Brief Illness Perceptions Questionnaire (BIPQ; [38]) measured emotional and cognitive representations of illness, capturing perceptions relating to illness identity, causes, control, consequences, timeline, concern, understanding and emotional response. Total scores for each domain can be used individually, or totalled, with higher scores representing a more threatening view of their illness.

Health service use

Access to health services, as well as changes in treatment, and care received was measured via a modified Client Service Receipt Inventory (CSRI; [39]), adapted to be suitable for online delivery and participant self-report.

Covariates

Life events

Any significant life events which may have happened between outcome assessments were measured via the List of Threatening Experiences Questionnaire (LTE-Q; [40]). Changes in employment status were recorded regularly as part of the CSRI [39].

Medication adherence

Self-reported adherence to depression medication was measured with the 5-item Medication Adherence Report Scale (MARS-5; [41]).

Patient and Public Involvement

The study was co-developed with service users in our Patient Advisory Board. They were involved in the choice of measures, the timing and issues of engagement and have also been involved in developing the analysis plan and representative(s) are authors of this paper and critically reviewed it.

Statistical analyses

Baseline characteristics of the sample were described using means and standard deviations or numbers and percentages as appropriate. To examine whether depressed mood is associated with the availability of data across all modes of data collection, participants were divided using scores on the IDS-SR and CIDI-SF (see Supplementary file 3 for operationalisation) into those who are symptomatic at baseline and those who are not (those with no/mild symptoms and some symptoms are pooled together due to the low number of people with no/mild symptoms at baseline (n = 4)). Chi-squared tests examined differences between those with baseline symptoms of depression and those without in categorial data, and linear regressions in continuous data.

The number and percentage of people who have provided any data via the aRMT and pRMT apps and the wearable device throughout the course of follow-up have been summarised, then divided into quartiles to examine the numbers of people who have provided 0–25% of expected data, 26–50%, 51–75 and > 75% of data throughout follow-up. Fitbit wear time estimates were calculated based on the presence of a single heart rate value, greater than zero, per 15-min window.

P-values comparing the amount of data available between people with symptoms of depression at baseline and those without symptoms of depression at baseline were created using Chi-Squared tests. T-tests compared the number of ESM questions completed in total across all follow-up timepoints between those with and without depression symptoms at baseline. Data were analysed using STATA v16.0.","The study aimed to examine whether data collected via multiparametric RMT can be used to reliably track illness course and predict relapse in MDD.

The authors studied the direct, indirect, and mortality-related costs for 24 rare diseases across 5 therapeutic areas: metabolic disorders, hematologic disorders, immunological disorders, congenital disorders, and neurological disorders. In addition to comparing the costs of these rare diseases to common diseases, they compared the burden of care when treatment is available vs when no treatment exists.

“Scarcity of data and disease complexity mean the full extent of the patient, family, and social burden of rare diseases will likely remain undocumented,” the authors explained.

First, they generated a database of 373 rare diseases that cover 8.4 million patients in the United States, then reviewed more than 500 articles and lists and identified top priority areas through discussions with physicians and experts. The 5 therapeutic areas encompass 227 well-documented rare diseases. Conversations with patient advocacy groups and physicians led to the 24 more relevant rare diseases in the priority therapeutic areas.

The 24 rare diseases impact more than 500,000 people in the United States. There were 24 chronic mass-market diseases, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and Alzheimer disease, that were used as benchmark comparisons.

Direct costs included prescription drugs, medical products, inpatient and outpatient hospitalization, home health care, professional services, and administration. Indirect costs comprised productivity costs for patient and caregiver, work loss, home changes, cost of secondary treatments, and travel and accommodation. Mortality costs were calculated as the value of statistical life, or $130,000 per year (aka $10.3 million for a 79-year average lifespan in the United States).

The authors found that the total cost to society for the 24 rare diseases was $125 million, and the average overall economic burden per patient per year (PPPY) was $266,000 (range, $121,000-$334,000. The overall economic burden is approximately 10 times the cost associated with mass market diseases ($26,000 PPPY).

Among the rare diseases, hematology had the largest proportion of direct costs (74%) while congenital diseases had the lowest proportion (47%). However, congenital diseases had the largest proportion of indirect costs (43%) and hematology had the smallest (4%). Neurological diseases had the highest proportion of mortality costs (43%) vs only 9% for congenital diseases.

Among the mass-market diseases, indirect costs accounted for 61% of the overall cost while direct costs accounted for 26% and mortality costs for 13%.

In the scenario analysis of costs when treatments are not available, the authors found total costs PPPY increased 21.2%, ranging from just 2.2% for congenital diseases to 51.8% for metabolic diseases.

This 21.2% increase breaks down to:

$63,000 PPPY in direct costs with treatment vs $118,000 PPPY without treatment

$40,000 PPPY in indirect costs with treatment vs $73,000 PPPY without treatment

$36,000 PPPY in mortality costs with treatment vs $49,000 PPPY without treatment

“Importantly, across all the therapeutic areas assessed, access to treatment effectively shifts the burden relating to indirect and mortality costs into direct costs (treatment and other direct costs),” the authors wrote. “These costs are more likely to be financed by private and public payers.”

When no treatments are available, there is an increase in productivity loss for patients and caregivers, highlighting the substantial value for society when there is access to rare disease treatments.

The authors noted that the study highlights the needs for policy makers to ensure continued innovation for rare disease therapies based on the positive economic return. There is also justification to increase the government’s investment in diagnosis and newborn screening, they said.

“Policy makers must recognize the distinct characteristics of developing and commercializing rare disease treatments and that the value assessment for rare disease treatments greatly differs from mass market diseases,” the authors conclude. “Policy changes should be specific to the unique nature of rare disease drug development.”

Employee Laid Off By Indeed Singapore, He Responds By Raiding Office Pantry

Mass layoffs were rampant back in 2022, leaving many fired employees in a difficult situation. The trend appears to have continued in 2023, affecting thousands more workers, including in Singapore.

Recently, job hiring platform Indeed conducted a round of layoffs, affecting 15% of its total workforce. Singaporeans were among those affected, with one of them taking to TikTok to share his experience.

He too had to leave his position at the company — but not without taking advantage of their well-stocked pantry.

Taking to TikTok, the OP first broke the news to his mother in a video on 24 Mar.

Telling her that Indeed Singapore laid him off, he jokes to her that he might focus more on TikTok for now.

The OP then follows it up with a second video, in which he raids the office pantry one last time before leaving.

“I just got laid off from Indeed,” he says in the caption, showing the pantry which contains a wide variety of snacks — including Hello Panda cookies, Yam Yam treats and several bags of potato chips.

Taking a couple of them, he fills up a massive bag before sneaking out to make his getaway.

Video goes viral on TikTok

The video has since gone viral, with over 100 comments and 8000 views at the time of writing.

A few commenters even asked him to plunder more snacks, pointing out that the worst had already happened.

Other Singaporeans previously working for Indeed also shared that the lay-offs had affected them as well.

There were also those who wished him the best in his future endeavours, which included being a full-time travel officer for a local touring group.

Indeed lays off 2,200 employees

According to a press release on 22 Mar, Indeed laid off 2,200 employees, which translated to roughly about 15% of its workforce.

The lay-offs will affect “nearly every team”, according to Indeed chief executive officer Chris Hyams.

The Business Times reports that the layoffs affected more than 200 Singapore-based employees. On 22 Mar, the company cut the jobs of 90% of its Singapore team responsible for engineering and product development.

Roles under talent acquisition, trust and safety also bore the brunt of the layoffs.

Indeed’s Anson Road tech office has also closed down.

“We remain committed to Singapore, with our other local office supporting all Singapore employees,” a spokesperson said.

579,579,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/instagram-adds-credits-ensure-black-creators-are-cited-work-rcna18972,New Instagram feature aims to curb ‘inequality in the creator ecosystem’,"Instagram announced Monday that it will introduce a special tag for professional accounts and influencers that ensures they receive credit for their content, an attempt to address complaints that Black users are not credited for starting trends or are shut out from profiting from them.

The tag is available to business and creator accounts, and comes on the heels of nationwide discussions and content strikes by Black content creators who pushed out viral posts saying they do not receive credit for their work.

Alexis Michelle Adjei, a data analyst, and Cameryn Boyd, an engineer, envisioned and created the label with these disparities and Black creators in mind, particularly that creators make a living off producing social media content and that Black creators should share equally in that, too, they said.

Adjei said, ""Black creators and addressing that inequity in the creator ecosystem"" was top-of-mind when developing the new feature.

Twice as many white influencers are making upward of $100,000 a year as are Black ones who are making similar content to similarly sized audiences, according to a study published in December by MSL, a communications company, and The Influencer League, an educational organization. The report also found a 29 percent pay gap between white creators and all creators of color.

""We want to ensure that as Black creators’ content is being distributed as it already is, they are getting the proper attribution so that they have the opportunity to get all of those growth and monetization and career-starting opportunities like their contemporaries are,"" said Boyd, a Spelman College graduate. “It’s really critical, as we’re moving towards this new age where creators are so important and creators are really able to use their craft to support themselves in their lives, that Black creators are getting the same opportunity, as they’re already creating the content.”

Alexis Michelle Adjei is a data analyst at Instagram. Noemie Tshinanga

Adjei and Boyd joined Meta in August 2020 before landing on the idea the following February. They worked on it with colleague Alexandra Zaoui, building it out together and pitching it across different teams at Instagram’s parent company, Meta, until eventually getting their own team, which prepared the feature to launch this week under the pair’s leadership.

Adjei, a Stanford University graduate, said the need for a formal credit was apparent, and it just took the right set of eyes at Meta to see it.

“I think we were just so close to the need that we were able to see and we kind of had that same situation of like, why doesn’t this exist? And then we went the next step of like, let’s make it exist.”

Adjei and Boyd said the attribution will not affect the algorithm, which determines what posts are in a user's feed. But since the algorithm already considers what type of content users previously liked, viewed or shared when determining how to personalize content to users, the reach of credited creators should continue to grow naturally as a result.

“Now, you can just have this enhanced tag and the idea there was because we know that Black creators’ content was already going viral and was being shared,"" Boyd said. ""But they weren’t getting that attribution. The hope is that they will now get the credit and that piece of content where their contribution can be traced back to their accounts so that people have the opportunity to follow them and they can grow their influence.”

Adjei and Boyd said the goal is to curb the problem of uncredited Black work. And for Black creators to go as viral as their content.

It traveled to Florida from across the tropics and brought with it new disease concerns.

A mosquito known only by its scientific name, Culex lactator, is the latest to establish in the Sunshine State, according to a new study by UF/IFAS Florida Medical Entomology Laboratory.

“We need to be vigilant for introductions of new mosquito species because each introduction comes with the possibility that the introduced species will facilitate the transmission of a mosquito-transmitted disease,” said Lawrence Reeves, lead author of the study and an assistant professor and mosquito biologist at the UF/IFAS research center in Vero Beach.

Researchers said there are around 90 mosquito species in Florida out of the more than 3,600 types of mosquitos found globally. When a new type is found in Florida, Reeves and his team use DNA analysis and other tools to identify it.

Researchers said Culex lactator is found in Central America and northern South America, and is part of the species that transmit the West Nile and St. Louis encephalitis viruses. But researchers said it is unclear whether Culex lactator will contribute to the transmission of those viruses in Florida.

So far, the Culex lactator is known to live in Collier County – south and west of Naples – Lee County west of Fort Myers, and in the Homestead area of Miami-Dade County, though it may have also spread elsewhere in the state.

Scientists said they are concerned about the rate and frequency of new species establishing in Florida. Reeves said the detections of nonnative mosquito species are increasingly frequent, with 11 of 17 nonnative species first reported in the past two decades, and six of these 17 detected in only the past five years.

“Climate change may improve the chances of tropical mosquito species becoming established once they make it to Florida if the state becomes warmer,” Reeves said. “Increasing storm frequency and intensity could also blow in more mosquitoes and other species from the Caribbean, Central America and elsewhere.”

These sounds include regular breathing, but wheezing, crackling, stridor, and other sounds can also occur. Share on Pinterest FG Trade/Getty Images An individual’s respiratory system comprises many parts, including: the lungs

the airways, such as the trachea and bronchial tubes

blood vessels and muscles

the ribs

the diaphragm When a person breathes, these parts work together to provide the body with oxygen. During breathing, an individual’s lungs can make a variety of sounds. And while certain lung sounds are typical and indicate that the lungs are working correctly, other lung sounds can indicate an underlying health condition. This article will explore the different lung sounds and what may be causing them. It also discusses potential treatment options and when to speak with a doctor.

Regular lung sounds When a doctor listens to a person’s lungs, they note the frequency, intensity, and quality of the sounds they hear. These factors can help them determine whether the sounds from the lungs are regular or not. Breath sounds can differ depending on where they occur in the respiratory system. Healthcare professionals classify them in the following ways : Normal lung or vesicular breath sound: A doctor can hear this sound over most of the chest with a stethoscope, a device for listening to a person’s internal body sounds. Vesicular breath sounds occur when air flows into and out of the lungs during breathing. The sound is soft, low pitched, and rustling in quality. It is also continuous, more intense, and high pitched during inhalation than exhalation.

Vesicular breath sounds occur when air flows into and out of the lungs during breathing. The sound is soft, low pitched, and rustling in quality. It is also continuous, more intense, and high pitched during inhalation than exhalation. Bronchial breath sound: The bronchial breath sound is audible over the trachea as a person breathes out. The sound is loud, hollow, and high pitched. However, if a doctor hears a bronchial breath outside the trachea, it could indicate a health issue.

The bronchial breath sound is audible over the trachea as a person breathes out. The sound is loud, hollow, and high pitched. However, if a doctor hears a bronchial breath outside the trachea, it could indicate a health issue. Normal tracheal breath sound: A doctor can hear this sound over the trachea. It is very loud, harsh, and high pitched.

Wheezing Wheezing is a high pitched, continuous sound. A doctor may be able to hear a person wheezing with or without a stethoscope. Health experts classify wheezes into three groups : Monophonic wheezes: This type of wheeze produces one note and occurs during inhalation or exhalation. A monophonic wheeze can have a constant or varied frequency, and it may have a long duration or occur during both phases of respiration.

This type of wheeze produces one note and occurs during inhalation or exhalation. A monophonic wheeze can have a constant or varied frequency, and it may have a long duration or occur during both phases of respiration. Polyphonic wheezes: A polyphonic wheeze has multiple notes and occurs during exhalation. They can also increase in pitch towards the end of exhalation.

A polyphonic wheeze has multiple notes and occurs during exhalation. They can also increase in pitch towards the end of exhalation. Squawks: A squawk is a brief wheeze that occurs during inhalation. Wheezing can result from blockages or when a person’s airways become constricted. Causes of wheezing can include: asthma

chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)

tumors

obstruction of the airways by a foreign body

mucus buildup in the airways

Crackling Crackles, also known as rales, are intermittent sounds generally audible during inhalation. They can sound similar to bubbling, popping, or clicking noises. Experts define a crackle as: Fine: These occur in the small airways and are soft and high pitched. Fine crackles may occur more frequently during a breath than coarse crackles and only happen during inhalation.

These occur in the small airways and are soft and high pitched. Fine crackles may occur more frequently during a breath than coarse crackles and only happen during inhalation. Medium: These result from air bubbling through mucus in the small bronchi — two tubes that carry air from the trachea to the lungs. The bronchi branch off into smaller and smaller passageways, which eventually lead to air sacs called alveoli.

These result from air bubbling through mucus in the small bronchi — two tubes that carry air from the trachea to the lungs. The bronchi branch off into smaller and smaller passageways, which eventually lead to air sacs called alveoli. Coarse: Coarse crackles occur in the larger bronchi tubes and are loud, low pitched, and last longer than fine crackles. They mainly occur during inhalation but can also happen during exhalation. Crackles occur as a result of small airways suddenly snapping open. They may indicate that a person’s lungs have fluid inside them or are not inflating correctly. Causes of crackling include: pneumonia

COPD

pulmonary edema, which refers to fluid in the lungs

interstitial lung disease, a group of diseases that cause scarring of the lungs

heart failure

chronic bronchitis

Rhonchi Rhonchi are low pitched, continuous sounds that sound similar to snoring. They occur due to blockages in the large airways of the lungs. Rhonchi can occur during exhalation or exhalation and inhalation, but not inhalation alone. They happen due to the movement of fluid and other secretions in the large airways. This can result from conditions such as asthma and viral infections in the upper respiratory system.

Stridor Stridor is a high pitched sound that develops in the upper airway. It mainly occurs when a person inhales and can mostly be audible in the neck. They develop due to an obstruction in the upper respiratory tract. The sound comes from air squeezing past a narrowed area of the upper respiratory tract. Causes of stridor include : laryngomalacia, where an infant’s larynx tissue is soft and floppy

vocal cord lesions

tracheomalacia, a condition that causes the cartilage of an infant’s trachea to be weakened and soft

bronchomalacia, a condition where an infant has weakened cartilage in their bronchial tubes

compression due to swelling or lesions

Pleural rub Pleural rub is a creaking, grating, rubbing sound that occurs due to inflamed pleural surfaces rubbing against each other. The pleurae are membranes that cover a person’s lungs and aid respiration. An individual’s pleurae can become inflamed due to certain health conditions that cause pain or tenderness. Causes of pleural rub include : pneumonia

pulmonary embolism, a blood clot that travels to an artery in the lungs

malignant pleural disease, a buildup of fluid and cancerous cells that gathers between the chest wall and the lungs

pleurisy, when the pleurae become inflamed

Diagnosis When a doctor wants to listen to a person’s lungs, they will generally use a stethoscope, which they place on various parts of a person’s chest and back to check for different lung sounds. They may also tap an individual’s back to listen for nodules or fluid buildup. This technique involves placing the stethoscope below a person’s rib cage and tapping down their back. This helps the healthcare professional listen for any changes in pitch when tapping. They may also use other listening tools, such as computerized lung sound analysis devices, for diagnosis. Doctors can also request blood tests, CT scans, or X-rays during diagnosis.

Treatment The treatment for atypical lung sounds will depend on the cause and severity of their symptoms. An individual with irregular lung sounds may require antibiotics if there is an infection. Doctors may also recommend anti-inflammatories to treat conditions involving inflammation. A person with a long-term lung condition may require regular medications or treatments. If there are more serious symptoms, treatment in the hospital and possibly surgery may be necessary.

Anyone who experiences unusual or atypical lung sounds should speak with a doctor. Certain lung sounds can indicate serious health conditions.","Lung sounds are the noises a person makes as they breathe in and out.

Studying mice, researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis have discovered that roseolovirus can trigger autoimmunity in a previously unknown way: by disrupting the process by which immune cells learn to avoid targeting their own body's cells and tissues.

Autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and Type 1 diabetes are thought to arise when people with a genetic susceptibility to autoimmunity encounter something in the environment that triggers their immune systems to attack their own bodies. Scientists have made progress in identifying genetic factors that put people at risk, but the environmental triggers have proven more elusive.

Researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis have discovered that a viral infection can set a destructive process in motion, culminating in autoimmunity long after the infection has resolved. The researchers investigated the impact of viral infection on T cells, a group of immune cells that play a key role in many autoimmune conditions. In the study, which was conducted in mice, the researchers showed that murine roseolovirus infects the thymus — the organ where self-destructive T cells are identified and eliminated — and disrupts the screening process in the organ. Months after infection, the mice develop an autoimmune disease of the stomach driven by self-destructive T cells.

The study, published Feb. 28 in the Journal of Experimental Medicine, describes a previously unknown way a virus can trigger autoimmunity. Further, it suggests that human roseoloviruses, close relatives of murine roseolovirus, warrant investigation as possible causes of autoimmunity in people.

“It is very hard to find the culprit of a crime that was never even at the scene of the crime,” said senior author Wayne M. Yokoyama, MD, the Sam J. Levin and Audrey Loew Levin Professor of Arthritis Research. “As clinicians, we often look directly in the diseased tissue, and if we find no virus we conclude that the disease was not caused by a virus. But here we have a situation in which a virus is doing its damage someplace else entirely. This virus goes to the thymus, which is where T cells undergo a process to select those cells useful for immune defense but also get rid of T cells that are too likely to damage the body’s own tissues. And what we find is that this whole process, which is called central tolerance, is affected. T cells that shouldn’t leave the thymus get out, and they manifest months later in the stomach, causing an autoimmune disease in a location that was never infected with the virus.”

Human and mouse roseoloviruses are members of the herpesvirus family. In people, roseoloviruses cause roseola, a mild childhood illness that involves a few days of fever and rash. Most people have been infected with at least one roseolovirus by the time they start kindergarten. Like other herpesviruses, roseoloviruses cause lifelong infections, although the virus goes dormant and rarely causes symptoms after the initial infection.

Scientists have long suspected that roseoloviruses may be linked to autoimmunity. But the ubiquity of the viruses makes investigating any such connection difficult. It is hard to look for differences between infected and uninfected people when nearly everyone is infected early in life.

Instead, Yokoyama, first author Tarin Bigley, MD, PhD, a fellow in pediatric rheumatology, and colleagues studied murine roseolovirus, a recently discovered virus that infects the thymus and T cells of mice in the wild. The researchers infected newborn mice with the virus. Twelve weeks later, all of the mice had developed autoimmune gastritis, or stomach inflammation, though there were no signs of the virus in their stomachs. If the virus was promptly eliminated with antiviral drug treatment in the first few days, while it was still actively replicating, the mice did not develop gastritis three months later. If, however, the researchers waited to give an antiviral until the mice were 8 weeks old — after the active infection had resolved but before the mice showed signs of stomach problems — the drug did no good at all; the mice still went on to develop gastritis a few weeks later.

Scientists already knew that viral infection can lead to autoimmunity if some of the virus’s proteins happen to resemble normal human proteins. Antibodies meant to target the virus end up also reacting with normal human cells. The researchers found that the mice with gastritis had developed antibodies against proteins on stomach cells. But they also had developed antibodies against a wide array of normal proteins associated with other autoimmune conditions. In addition, they had many T cells that targeted the body’s own normal proteins, and other changes to the T cell population that biased the immune system toward autoimmunity.

“We don’t think the autoimmune gastritis is the result of molecular mimicry because we observed such a broad autoantibody response,” Bigley said. “The observation that infected mice produced diverse autoantibodies, in addition to the anti-stomach autoantibodies, suggested that murine roseolovirus infection early in life was inducing a wide-ranging defect in the body’s ability to avoid targeting its own proteins. This is why we focused our studies on the impact of infection on central tolerance rather than molecular mimicry.”

The next step is to investigate whether a similar process occurs in people.

“Human autoimmune disease also may occur via viral infection that gets cleared but leaves damage that can cause autoimmunity,” Yokoyama said. “But if so, there has to be some other factor that we don’t understand yet that makes some people more susceptible to the autoimmune effects of roseolovirus infection, because almost all people are infected, but most people do not get autoimmune diseases. That is a really important topic for further investigation.”","Visit the News Hub News Release New way viruses trigger autoimmunity discovered In mice, roseolovirus disrupts immune cells’ process of learning self-recognition by Tamara Bhandari•February 28, 2022 Bernard Kramarsky Roseolovirus particles emerge from an infected immune cell (above).

Now, researchers are looking to the gut and an FDA-approved drug to treat inflammatory bowel disease to aid in the prevention of heart disease.

Lots of junk food and lots of sugar are staples in the standard American diet. In fact, 63% of calories consumed by Americans come from refined and processed foods, 25 % come from animal-based foods and only 12% come from plant-based foods.

""That diet is changing how the microbes that live in your gut work,"" said Marianna Byndloss the Assistant Professor of Pathology, Microbiology, and Immunology at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. ""They're using components of that diet and then producing some products that induce inflammation in your heart and in your arteries and cause cardiovascular disease.""

That's why researchers at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center are looking at a drug used to treat inflammatory bowel disease to fix the microbes, or bacteria, in the gut.

""A drug called five-amino salicylic acid, or 5-ASA, which is a drug that restores the health of the intestines and prevent the microbes from producing these bad metabolites,"" said Byndloss.

In animal studies, the drug increased the levels of good bacteria and decreased the bad bacteria in the gut.

The researchers are also looking at how improving the health of these gut microbes can lower the risk for colorectal cancer. Byndloss says the best diet for healthy gut microbes is rich in vegetables, grains and fiber.

586,586,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-06594-w,Association between height loss and cardiovascular disease in the Korean elderly,"Prevention of CVD is a major public concern due to its increasing prevalence and resulting social burden14, and the need for better stratification of CVD risks prevails. Among the CVD risk factors, height is recently focused upon as it is known to be inversely associated with CVD outcomes1. Additionally, a number of studies have suggested that it is simple and economically viable for clinicians to monitor a patient’s change in height as a measure of health problems15. In this nationwide large-scale population-based study, we found that height loss is associated with CVD morbidity. These results suggest that height shrinkage is an informative, and easy to measure, indicator of worsening cardiovascular health at the population level, when more detailed measures might not be available.

Although age-related decline in height is a common observation, its possible association with CVD outcomes has rarely been studied. In prior studies3,4,5 on this issue, the small number of cases with height loss, outcome events, or lack of a clearly specified population could give rise to aberrant results, which must therefore be considered and interpreted cautiously. Of note, height shrinkage is greatest among taller individuals—who are known to be at low risk of CVD—as well as older age groups and women16. Thus, a lack of consideration of baseline height leads to an attenuation bias in the height-CVD association. We believe that despite the great height loss and/or long-term follow-up duration, a lack of significant results in previous studies was due to the dilution effect between greater height loss and lower baseline CVD risk in tall people. We analyzed a large-scale, nationwide cohort, which included both men and women, as well as young and elderly people, using a proportional indicator for height loss.

The causality between height loss and CVD outcomes remains to be further elucidated2, but longitudinal designs as used in the present study indicate that height loss might be a direct cause rather than a result of CVD. Given that osteoporotic consequences are highly linked to height loss17, we excluded a priori patients with vertebral fracture and only considered those with osteoporosis during the follow-up. Thus, our study included a limited number of cases of height loss caused by intervertebral disc degeneration; osteoarthritic conditions of the spine, hip, or knee; or weakness of the back muscles18. Paravertebral muscle weakness may reflect sarcopenia19. The increased risk of CVD associated with height loss may reflect poor muscular strength and skeletal muscle mass loss, both of which have been shown to be predictors of mortality20. Moreover, it has been established that women experience a greater degree of height decline over time than men, with one of the reasons being their vulnerability to osteoporosis and/or broken bones, and while height loss in women reflects the decrease in bone density, the cause of height loss in men has not yet been reported21.

Significance of height loss in cases of ischemic stroke was partially explained by the outstanding incidence of ischemic stroke in our cohort, compared with that of hemorrhagic stroke or myocardial infarction. Additionally, from the traditional mechanistic perspective, higher luminal pressure and increased shearing stress from height loss, particularly in the cerebral artery, may accelerate the progression of atherosclerosis22, which leads to ischemic stroke. Our subgroup analysis further showed that the correlation between height loss and incident ischemic stroke remained robust among men, which could be partially explained by the relative contribution of height loss to incident stroke (Supplementary Table 6). Our results suggest that height loss in elderly men could be an indicator of impending ischemic stroke and should be an important consideration for physicians. Furthermore, future research considering body composition would be helpful to elucidate the possible mechanism of the relationship between height loss and CVD and gender difference of this association.

Several limitations in the present study should be acknowledged. First, given that recruitment was based on the database of health examinations (the overall participation rate was 65.3%), the generated data cannot be considered free from potential healthy-user bias. If people who had not received a health screen had been included in the analysis, the significance of the results would be rather more remarkable because they would be more vulnerable to height loss and CVD development. This phenomenon might also be applied for underdiagnosis of osteoporosis in older men. Second, there may have been measurement inconsistencies as height was measured at different institutions. However, this non-differential misclassification of height loss would rather dilute the real effect. Third, some unmeasured confounding factors could remain. Early-life conditions, particularly nutrition, have been established to play an important role in shaping subsequent cardiovascular health23. Moreover, spine misalignment that can have an impact on the association24 was not considered in this study. A hospital-based study or expansion of clinical trial cohort that could capture those detailed clinical data is needed to confirm our findings.

Despite the limitations, this study contributes to the literature with its large-scale cohort sample and examination of detailed nation-wide health data. To clarify the association between height loss and cardiovascular events, a genetic or twin-track approach is needed. Further interventional research is needed to disentangle the effects of height loss prevention strategies (e.g., weight bearing exercises or anti-osteoporotic agents) on CVD incidence. Serial measurements of stature are highly feasible in clinical practice and may be useful as an indicator of cardiovascular health in the primary care setting, particularly in men.","Among the CVD risk factors, height is recently focused upon as it is known to be inversely associated with CVD outcomes1.

Ten years later, the cancer-fighting immune cells used in the therapy were still around, a sign the treatment can be long-lasting, researchers report February 2 in Nature.

California resident Doug Olsen was one of the patients. “From a patient’s viewpoint, when you’re told you’re pretty much out of options, the important thing is always to maintain hope. And certainly, I hoped this was going to work,” Olsen said at a February 1 news briefing.

The treatment, known as CAR-T cell therapy, used the patients’ own genetically engineered immune cells to track down and kill cancerous cells (SN: 6/27/18). Based on the results, “we can now conclude that CAR-T cells can actually cure patients with leukemia,” cancer immunologist and study coauthor Carl June of the University of Pennsylvania said at the briefing.

Olsen and the other patient had chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Both responded well to initial treatment. But it was unclear how long the modified cells would stick around, preventing the cancer’s return.

Cancer doctors and researchers “don’t use words like ‘cure’ lightly or easily,” said oncologist and study coauthor David Porter of the University of Pennsylvania at the briefing. But with both patients remaining cancer-free for more than a decade, he said, the therapy has performed “beyond our wildest expectations.”

The biggest disappointment is that the immunotherapy doesn’t work for everyone, Porter added. Some people don’t respond to the treatment. Others can develop dangerous side effects (SN: 1/17/20).

‘Vaccines are at the heart of how modern societies counter infectious disease threats. They are our most potent tool against pandemic risks and will be critical to any future response,” wrote Dr. Richard Hatchett, CEO of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI).

“The faster an effective vaccine is developed, the faster an incipient pandemic can be contained and controlled.”

Excerpts for Dr. Hatchett’s December 2021 post are inserted below:

“The X in “Disease X” stands for everything we don’t know.

It's a new disease, about which we will know very little when it first emerges: it may or may not be deadly, highly contagious, and a threat to our way of life.

We also don’t know when or how it will come across the viral frontier and infect people.

But we do know that the next Disease X is coming, and we must be ready.

In many ways, the COVID-19 pandemic is ‘proof of concept’ for the prototype-vaccine approach to rapidly developing vaccines against new viral threats.

The aspiration of the CEPI is for the world to be able to respond to the next “Disease X” with a new vaccine in just 100 days.

That’s just three months to defuse the threat of a pathogen to cause a pandemic.

Coupled with improved surveillance providing early detection and warning, and with swift and effective use of non-pharmaceutical interventions, delivering a vaccine in 100 days would give the world a fighting chance to extinguish the existential threat of a future pandemic virus.

Before the SARS-CoV-2 virus emerged, the previous vaccine-development record was for a live attenuated mumps vaccine, which took less than five years.

By comparison, the 326 days it took from the SARS-CoV-2 virus being identified to bring a COVID-19 vaccine into emergency use represented a quantum leap.

With tightening and shortening at each development stage and rethinking how we establish safety and efficacy for emergency response vaccines, cutting that timeline to 100 days is entirely feasible.

Scientifically, it’s about making advances across the whole life cycle of pandemic preparedness—from the moment a new pathogen is identified, through the rapid prototyping of a vaccine candidate, the testing and authorization of that vaccine to get it into the arms of people at risk.

Not all new diseases have pandemic potential.

There are around 260 viruses—belonging to roughly twenty-five viral families—known today to be able to infect humans.

Realistically, we can’t create individual new vaccines against several hundred or more potential or developing threats, let alone the 1.6 million or so more viral species that may exist in mammal or bird hosts and have yet to be discovered, but we can develop vaccines against prototypes of these threats.

In other words, we can focus our efforts on pathogens that exemplify some or all of the worst traits of a particular viral family.

For several years before the emergence of SARS-Cov-2, scientists were already working on vaccines against MERS and SARS, pathogens from the same coronavirus family.

What they learned enabled them to pivot quickly and respond at lightning speed to the new virus, laying the groundwork for the record-breaking effort to develop COVID-19 vaccines.

Scientists have been honing so-called rapid-response platforms to make “plug-and-play” vaccines. Some used mRNA technology, and others, like the University of Oxford’s ChAdOx, used viral vectors.

These innovations empower vaccine makers to ‘plug’ in the genetic code from a novel coronavirus that would trigger a protective immune response.

In this way, when a newly emerging virus comes across the frontier—and that is most certainly a “when” and not an “if”—we’ll have banked a vast amount of data on safety and immunogenicity regarding platform technology and the antigens of viruses that are closely related, if not precisely the same, as the new Disease X.

Creating the vaccine library could mean developing as many as 100 prototype vaccines to ensure we’ve got something in the knowledge bank to help us cover almost any threat.

If there’s one thing we found out during the COVID-19 crisis, it’s that pandemics are devastatingly expensive.

Unfortunately, being correctly prepared doesn’t come cheap.

By the end of 2025, it is forecast that COVID-19 will have cost the world $28 trillion over five years. The human cost is something we will never quantify, but its effects will undoubtedly reverberate for generations.

For its part, CEPI has a $3.5 billion pandemic-busting plan that will kickstart and coordinate this work.

Compared with the trillions lost to COVID-19, at $3.5 billion, this plan is not only value for money; it’s exactly what the world needs to ensure that our children never again face the hardship and loss we’ve had to endure from COVID-19,” concluded Dr. Hatchett’s blog post.

In the U.S., the government has been focused on preparing for an influenza pandemic for years.

The U.S. CDC says the annual 'flu shot' does not prevent zoonotic influenza infections in humans.

Pandemic influenzas are novel contagious respiratory diseases past between people in which the severity is unpredictable because human immune systems have not established natural defenses.

The most recent influenza pandemic occurred in 2009, which caused up to 400,000 deaths globally, with about 12,000 people in the U.S.

And during 2022, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has already confirmed avian influenza in ‘birds’ in various states.

However, in China, human cases of avian influenza A(H5N6) and related fatalities have been reported by Mainland health authorities in 2022.

The U.S. government is focused on these threats.

Recently, the U.S. National Influenza Vaccine Modernization Strategy and the White House American Pandemic Preparedness Plan outlined their priorities.

And the CDC's Influenza Risk Assessment report was recently issued in Dec. 2021.

Furthermore, on Feb. 25, 2022, the U.S.’s BARDA requested that Seqirus provide pandemic influenza vaccines (AUDENZ) and adjuvants for pre-pandemic stockpiling or for manufacture to support rapid response to an influenza pandemic or other public health emergency.

Researchers from University of Colorado School of Medicine analyzed data from more than 100,000 people with adenocarcinoma, a more aggressive cancer that's more likely to be caught in later stages.

They found that young patients 20-29 years old have had the highest increase in rates of new colon cancer cases diagnosed and are more likely to be in the distant stage of cancer when diagnosed, meaning the cancer has already spread. In particular, subgroups of non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic participants had the highest increases.

""Studying cases of adenocarcinoma alone is important, because those are the ones we're trying to prevent with screening and risk factor identification,"" explained study author Dr. Jordan Karlitz, chief of gastroenterology at Denver Health Medical Center.

The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), the leading organization on preventative medicine, recently changed the screening guidelines for colon cancer from age 50 down to age 45, after reviewing these recent trends of increasing cases of colon cancer in younger people.

As for why these rates might be rising, risk factors such as obesity, diet, or environmental factors could be playing a role, said Dr. Jay Bhatt, a primary care physician and ABC News contributor.

Karlitz noted another factor that could explain this trend is delay in diagnosis.

At the first symptom, younger people may not seek colon cancer screening immediately because of a misconception that it's an unlikely diagnosis. This can delay diagnosis, which gives the cancer time to progress to a later stage. These delays can be avoided with timely screening, according to Karlitz.

Common symptoms to look out for include rectal bleeding, persistent abdominal pain or fullness, and unexplained weakness.

""I actually discuss it with all patients over 40 to prepare them and if they had early colon cancer diagnosis in their family, it is even more important,"" Bhatt said about colon cancer screening.

This study does not factor in family history. If a family member has colon cancer, it can significantly raise the risk of developing colon cancer. Doctors recommend people with risk factors like family history and genetic syndromes such as Lynch syndrome to speak to their doctors as they may need earlier screening. Karlitz suggests holidays and family gatherings are a great time to be proactive and ask your family their medical history.

""If you're 45 years old, get screened on time -- do not wait.

What symptoms of Parkinson’s disease make it difficult to drive a car? Share on Pinterest dszc/Getty Images If a person is in the early stages of the disease, they may be able to drive safely. Their medications may control their symptoms well enough to ensure that they are still well-coordinated and able to react in a safe and timely manner. As a person’s Parkinson’s disease symptoms worsen over time, they may start to lose the ability to drive a car safely. A person with Parkinson’s disease may not be able to: react quickly to a hazard

turn the steering wheel

push on the brake or gas pedal Below are some of the symptoms that can make it difficult for a person to drive a car safely: Tremors Tremors are a common symptom of Parkinson’s disease. Tremors are involuntary muscle contractions that can cause a person to jerk or shake. Parkinson’s disease tremors can affect a person’s hands and may only appear on one limb or down one side of their body. Involuntary movements can become dangerous if a person is driving a vehicle. Stiffness and rigidity Stiffness and rigidity is another common symptom, present in 89% of cases of Parkinson’s disease. Parkinson’s disease can cause a person’s arms or legs to stiffen and become rigid. This stiffness can occur on both sides or just one side of a person’s body. Stiffness due to Parkinson’s disease can cause a person to experience a decreased range of motion. If Parkinson’s disease causes stiffness that heavily impacts a person’s range of motion, this may make it difficult for them to drive a vehicle. Lack of balance and coordination Parkinson’s disease can also cause a person to experience poor balance and coordination. It may also make it difficult for a person to keep their balance or begin to move when they have been sitting still for a period of time. If a person has poor balance and coordination, this can impact their ability to safely drive a car. Cognitive impairment Parkinson’s disease can cause a person to experience cognitive changes. This means that the person may: be easily distracted or disorganized

find it difficult to plan ahead

find it difficult to accomplish certain tasks

find it hard to focus in situations that divide their attention

feel overwhelmed when having to make choices

have difficulty remembering certain information

have difficulty finding the right words when speaking If a person has these cognitive changes, it may seriously affect their ability to drive safely, such as not being able to react to a hazard in the road or paying attention to the actions of other vehicles.

Parkinson’s disease medications and driving Common Parkinson’s disease medications can also cause side effects that affect how safely a person can drive. For example, carbidopa and levodopa (Sinemet), amantadine, dopamine agonists, and anticholinergics can cause the following side effects: sleepiness

dizziness

blurred vision

confusion These side effects can all make driving very dangerous. Not every person with Parkinson’s disease will experience these side effects. If a person does experience these side effects, they should report them to their doctor. A doctor may be able to adjust the person’s medication to help decrease these side effects.

When to stop driving a car with Parkinson’s disease People should stop driving if their Parkinson’s disease symptoms and medications make it unsafe to drive. The Parkinson’s Foundation suggests that a person follows some of the following steps to determine if it is still safe for them to drive: Another opinion: Ask a friend or family member for an honest opinion about their ability to drive.

Ask a friend or family member for an honest opinion about their ability to drive. Driving assessment: Take a driving assessment from their local Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV).

Take a driving assessment from their local Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). Driving Rehabilitation Specialist (DRS): Ask a doctor to recommend a DRS assessment. A DRS can provide an on-road and off-road test to see how much Parkinson’s disease affects the person’s driving. A DRS can also offer driving skill improvement training to those who can still drive safely.

Tips for transitioning from being able to drive to not being able to drive If a person has Parkinson’s disease but can still safely drive, they may wish to begin transitioning away from driving. A person may wish to reach out to friends or family or a Parkinson’s disease support group for help to ease the transition. If a person with Parkinson’s disease is transitioning away from driving, they may wish to start limiting their drives to shorter trips and only drive on familiar roads. It may also be a good idea to avoid: rush-hour traffic

driving on roads that are often busy

driving in bad weather, at night, or when visibility is poor

Alternative travel options If a person stops driving, they may need to find alternative travel options to maintain independence. Below are some alternative travel options for people who can no longer drive. Public transport: A person may be able to use local buses, subways, or trains to get around. Older adults and people with disabilities can often purchase bus passes at a reduced fee. A person should contact their local public transportation office to find out more about discounts and which routes they can take.

A person should contact their local public transportation office to find out more about discounts and which routes they can take. Taxis: If a person can afford it, they may wish to take a taxi for shorter journeys.

If a person can afford it, they may wish to take a taxi for shorter journeys. Family and friends: A person with Parkinson’s disease may wish to ask family members or friends to drive them to places. A person could perhaps prearrange for certain people to drive them to specific places on specific days each week.

Shuttle services: Some communities offer specific shuttle or van services for people living with disabilities. A person may wish to check with their local government and local community center to find out more about these services.

Some communities offer specific shuttle or van services for people living with disabilities. A person may wish to check with their local government and local community center to find out more about these services. Volunteer services: Some religious organizations or community-led initiatives have volunteers available to drive different community members to certain destinations.

Tips for families and caregivers If a person is concerned that a friend or family member’s Parkinson’s disease is affecting their driving, they may wish to observe them as they drive. By observing the person, they can get a good idea of their current driving ability and whether they are safe to drive. The NIA states that if a person cannot watch another person drive, they should look for other signs that they may no longer be safe to drive. These include : the person has been in multiple crashes or has had several “near misses”

the person’s car displays a number of new dents

the person has had several traffic tickets or warnings in the last few years

the person’s car insurance premiums have increased due to driving issues

there have been comments from neighbors or friends about the person’s driving

the person says they have anxiety about driving, particularly at night If a person believes that a friend or loved one should stop driving due to Parkinson’s disease, it is important to approach the subject sensitively. They should explain their reasoning and perhaps explain alternative transport options that may be available to the individual to help them transition away from driving more easily.

Parkinson’s disease support If a person has Parkinson’s disease and requires specific support, a number of organizations may be able to help. Below are some organizations that a person with Parkinson’s disease may want to contact: Parkinson’s Foundation: The Parkinson’s Foundation has a helpline that features specialists who can help people with Parkinson’s disease, caregivers, and healthcare providers navigate every aspect of Parkinson’s diesase. The Helpline is available at (800) 4PD-INFO (473-4636) or via email at helpline@parkinson.org.

Lecanemab collaboration to continue unchanged globally

Lecanemab supply agreement to extend to 10 years from 5 years for commercial manufacturing by Biogen

Both companies will continue to collaborate together with the goal of bringing more options to patients and maximizing the value of both products

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. and TOKYO, March 14, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Biogen Inc. (Nasdaq: BIIB) and Eisai Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan) announced today that the companies have amended their existing collaboration agreement on aducanumab, which is commercialized in the United States as ADUHELM® (aducanumab-avwa). Effective as of January 1, 2023, Eisai will receive a tiered royalty based on net sales of ADUHELM rather than sharing global profits and losses. The royalty rate starts at 2% and reaches 8% when annual sales exceed $1 billion. Effective immediately, Biogen’s existing final decision-making rights on ADUHELM have converted to sole decision making and commercialization rights worldwide. Overall, economic arrangements for both companies in 2022 are expected to remain materially unchanged with Eisai’s share of expenses capped at an agreed amount for the costs related to development, commercialization, and manufacturing of ADUHELM for the period from January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022. Once the tiered royalty model commences on January 1, 2023, Eisai will not participate in ADUHELM’s economics beyond these royalties.

The companies will continue to jointly develop and commercialize the investigational therapy lecanemab. Eisai continues to serve as the lead of lecanemab development and regulatory submissions globally with both companies co-commercializing and co-promoting the product, and Eisai having final decision-making authority. Both companies share economics equally with Eisai booking all sales for lecanemab and Biogen reflecting its 50% share of profits and losses.

The supply agreement related to lecanemab has been extended from five to 10 years. Biogen will manufacture the lecanemab drug substance in its Solothurn, Switzerland facility with the goal of providing reliable commercial supply worldwide.

“This amended collaboration agreement will increase operational efficiency and agility in addressing market developments, including the final determination of CMS on coverage of ADUHELM,” said Michel Vounatsos, Chief Executive Officer at Biogen. “In addition, we are pleased to be expanding our agreement with Eisai through a new long-term manufacturing contract.”

“The collaboration between both companies has resulted in the approval of ADUHELM in the U.S. as the first treatment to address a defining pathology of Alzheimer’s disease, which is a significant step into a new chapter of Alzheimer’s therapy.” said Haruo Naito, Chief Executive Officer at Eisai Co., Ltd. “We believe this new arrangement will be more effective and enable more focused execution with the goal of maximizing the value of both ADUHELM and lecanemab. Eisai will increase its focus on lecanemab and remains committed to bringing a new treatment option expeditiously to patients in need worldwide.”

Climate change is already having “widespread, pervasive impacts” on people everywhere in the world, a new report from the scientific panel says, due to the warming that has occurred so far — roughly 1.09 degrees Celsius (1.96 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels.

Global warming doesn’t only affect humans by changing the weather and melting the ice caps, the report warns. It also has resounding implications for how insects and other organisms move through the world, intermingle, and spread disease to human populations. “Climate-sensitive food-borne, water-borne, and vector-borne disease risks are projected to increase under all levels of warming,” the report says. (Vector-borne diseases are those spread by blood-sucking bugs like ticks and mosquitoes.) What’s more, the warming that has already taken place has already caused unprecedented disease impacts across the globe. Climate change is no longer a future prospect; it’s making people sick right now.

“One of the most striking conclusions in our report is that we’re seeing adverse impacts being much more widespread and being much more negative than expected in prior reports within the current 1.09 degrees that we have,” Camille Parmesan, a coordinating lead author of the report, told reporters on Sunday. “Some of the things that we’re seeing that were not expected at 1.09 degrees are diseases emerging into new areas.”

Insects and other organisms that carry disease spend much of their lives in the same place, which is why certain diseases are endemic to specific areas. Lyme disease, for example, is an illness spread by black-legged ticks — tiny, eight-legged, blood-sucking creatures that live in the Northeastern United States and other parts of the Northern Hemisphere. But climate change is messing with the environmental factors that geographically constrain these ticks. Warming temperatures and shifting weather patterns across the U.S. are making it easier for ticks to proliferate and move into new areas, where people and the doctors who treat them are unaccustomed to Lyme disease. It’s a double whammy, the report shows: Ticks are preying on bigger swaths of the population and growing more common where they already live. “Climate change can be expected to continue to contribute to the geographical spread of the Lyme disease vector,” the report says.

Similar stories are playing out in every corner of the globe, as diseases are emerging in places they have never been found before. Dengue fever, a mosquito-borne tropical illness that causes fever, headache, and vomiting and has a 20 percent death rate if it progresses and goes untreated, is projected to become an increasingly big risk for people in Asia, Europe, Central and South America, and sub-Saharan Africa as warm seasons grow longer and aedes aegypti mosquitoes expand their geographic range. “There are estimates of billions of additional people at risk of dengue fever later in the century,” Kristie Ebi, an epidemiologist at the University of Washington and a co-author of the report, said on Sunday.

Other mosquito-borne illnesses such as Zika virus, Chikungunya disease, and West Nile virus are at risk of becoming more common as climate change accelerates. So are serious water-borne diseases such as vibriosis and cholera, which cause nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting. Diarrheal diseases have decreased globally thanks to better distribution of medicines and low-tech medical interventions like treating patients orally with a mixture of water, glucose, and salts, but the report notes that increased rainfall and flooding in many regions has driven up the occurrence of diarrheal diseases such as cholera and other gastrointestinal infections.

And if existing diseases aren’t scary enough, melting permafrost and coastal erosion could surface prehistoric cemeteries, campsites, and reindeer burial grounds in the Arctic, unleashing ancient diseases that modern humans have no immunity to.

The report’s authors said that putting a number on future climate-related fatalities is extremely difficult, but they predict 250,000 extra deaths per year from heat, undernutrition, malaria, and diarrheal disease combined by 2050. Hundreds of existing diseases and more that will emerge in the coming years will add to the death toll.

Reducing the burden of disease on people is possible, but the clock is ticking to make those necessary adjustments, the report says. Developing surveillance systems for vector-borne diseases, implementing early warning systems to alert communities to those diseases and the prevalence of new vectors, and developing vaccines to inoculate people against vector-borne illnesses are all essential additions to the preparedness toolbox. To adapt to water-borne and food-borne illnesses, the report recommends governments improve access to potable water and protect water and sanitation systems from flooding. And protecting and preserving wild spaces such as wetlands, peatlands, and forests from human development has the two-pronged effect of sequestering carbon dioxide and preventing the spread of disease to humans by limiting contact between wild animals and people.

Zak Smith, director of the Natural Resources Defense Council’s wildlife division, who was not involved in the IPCC’s report, told Grist that governments largely aren’t prepared to take the necessary steps to protect public health from the increased risk of disease due to climate change. “What happened with COVID doesn’t raise my confidence level that people are ready to make the kinds of investments we need,” he said. “I think COVID is a warning. We don’t have this.”","On Monday, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a stark warning that time is running out to adapt to climate change.

The billionaire reality star and businesswoman made the comments in an interview with Variety ahead of the release of her family's new show, The Kardashians.

""I have the best advice for women in business,"" Kardashian says in a clip that went viral on social media. ""Get your f****** ass up and work. It seems like nobody wants to work these days.""

Many on social media were quick to point out that growing up in a wealthy family in Los Angeles has its advantages when it comes to being able to find work, describing the star's comments as ""tone deaf"".

Responses on social media

""I wish I was born rich so I could be self-made,"" one Twitter user commented. ""I love when people who were born to obscenely rich, highly networked and well connected parents pontificate about importance of work,"" said another.

""You were a literal product of an already established elite lifestyle. Girl SHUT UP and leave us working class people alone!"" another user commented.

On Instagram, actress and activist Jameela Jamil shared an image of the clip, and posted: ""They are a super impressive family of businesswomen and are products of a ridiculously good start and a genius manager in their mother as well as their own hard work and personal sacrifices.""

She added: ""They shouldn't be asked about their secret to success. They shouldn't answer those questions. It's all obvious to everyone, and I hope nobody holds themselves to the standards of people who were raised by millionaires.""

Kardashian, 41, is the daughter, of the late Robert Kardashian, a high-profile lawyer who was best known for defending OJ Simpson in 1995, and ""momager"" Kris Jenner. She first stepped into the public eye as Paris Hilton's friend and wardrobe assistant, before rising to fame in the reality show Keeping Up With The Kardashians.

She has four children with rapper Kanye West and is now in a relationship with comedian Pete Davidson, 28, following their split.

Heading critics off at the pass

In her interview, Kardashian pre-empted criticism of being ""famous for being famous"".

""Who gives a f***,"" she said. ""We focus on the positive. We work our asses off. If that's what you think, then sorry. We just don't have the energy for that. We don't have to sing or dance or act; we get to live our lives - and hey, we made it. I don't know what to tell you.""

Criticism of Kardashian comes after Love Island star and influencer Molly-Mae Hague came under fire in January for comments made about work and poverty in a podcast interview.

More to come on her relationship with Davidson

Elsewhere in the interview, Kardashian revealed that viewers of her new reality show will get to find out more about her relationship with Davidson - although he will not physically feature in the first series.

West - now known as Ye - will feature in the first episode of the series, which launches in the UK in April.

Despite tensions between the former couple, Kardashian said she will not speak negatively about him.

""Being in the public eye and having disagreements publicly is never easy,"" she said. ""But I do believe in handling it all privately. I believe in championing publicly and criticising privately.

I don't think I would ever criticise the father of my children on my TV show.

597,597,https://www.advancedsciencenews.com/parkinsons-disease-treatment-based-on-artificial-enzymes/,Parkinson’s disease treatment based on artificial enzymes,"Parkinson’s disease is the second-most common neurodegenerative disorder worldwide after Alzheimer’s disease. The underlying cause is not understoond, meaning that an effective cure — or even therapeutics — remain elusive. Recently, researchers have tried a range of different therapies, from hydrogels to individualized brain cell grafts to simply getting a better picture of the brain. Challenges certainly remain.

Scientists at the Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People’s Hospital have recently taken a novel approach to tackle this disease. Publishing in Advanced Materials, they turned to nanozymes — artificial enzymes based on nanomaterials — to tackle one of the known attributes of Parkinson’s disease.

A Prussian blue-based nanozyme, dubbed PBzyme, was used in a mouse model and was found to be effective against inflammation associated with neurodegeneration. It is also protects neurons and microglia — the primary immune cells of the central nervous system — against the prodrug compound MPTP, which has long been known to induce rapid onset of Parkinson’s disease.

Schematic illustration of mechanism underlying PBzyme activity as a pyroptosis — an inflammatory form of cell death — inhibitor for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease

Prussian blue is already an FDA-approved antidote against poisoning from thallium and other radioactive elements. But in addition to this, the PBzyme is capable of scavenging reactive oxygen species, such as hydroxyl radicals and peroxides.

These molecules are known to play a role in the development of inflammatory responses, in particular with respect to the protein NLRP3, which triggers inflammatory responses in cells when under oxidative stress (from reactive oxygen species), and has been known to play a key role in the progression of Parkinson’s disease. Cutting off this immune response at its source is what the team in this paper hoped to achieve with PBzyme, with some promising preliminary results.

As shown in the illustration, the PBzymes mop up the reactive oxygen species produced by the cells when in contact with MPTP, thus breaking the chain of the NLRP3 inflammation response that results in neuron cell death.

In the mouse study, mice with MPTP-induced Parkinson’s disease were injected with PBzyme ten days after Parkinson’s onset, and it was found that their degradation in motor functions was clearly improved and alleviated. Furthermore, mice in the control group (no Parkinson’s disease) showed no difference in motor function before and after PBzyme injection, suggesting that PBzyme causes no adverse neurological effects.

Follow-up studies also showed that most if not all of the PBzyme nanoparticles were metabolized by the body after about 30 days. Whilst no obvious adverse affects were seen in the mice, a follow-up study would be needed to look at the potential long-term toxicity of PBzyme before this treatment could progress to the first human trial stages.

Nevertheless, as we continue to learn more about the underlying causing of Parkinson’s and other neurodegenerative diseases, Prussian blue nanozymes could be a useful tool for the longterm treatment and care for such disorders in the future.

600,600,https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/cuban-peso-free-fall-against-dollar-2022-01-26/,Cuban peso in free fall against the dollar,"













HAVANA, Jan 26 (Reuters) - The Cuban peso was trading at nearly 100 to the dollar on the informal market Tuesday, according to a trader and online trackers, a depreciation of more than 30% in less than a month and four times the fixed official rate.

The peso's free fall is bad news for a population that for two years has confronted a grave economic crisis and unusually severe shortages of food, medicine and other goods, a predicament made worse by the coronavirus pandemic and the Cold War-era U.S. embargo.

Local economists and business leaders attributed the recent depreciation to a growing perception that Cuba's economy continues to weaken, with runaway inflation, while the government appears unable to reverse the trend.

Independent online news outlet El Toque tracker, the most watched in the communist-run country, had the greenback trading for 97.50 pesos on Tuesday, compared to 72 when the year began.

The local electronic currency, called the MLC, which Cubans use on par with U.S. dollars to purchase goods in domestic specialty markets, was rising in tandem with the U.S. currency. It was trading on the informal market at 95.90 on Tuesday, the online trackers showed.

The peso and MLC have no value outside of Cuba. The government fixes the exchange rate, currently 25 to a dollar, but has stopped trading dollars and other exchangeable currencies because it says it has no cash.

""We have to deepen the political discussion with those who are increasing prices in the state and non-state sector,"" President Miguel Diaz-Canel told a Communist Party meeting last week, blaming speculation and greed for rising prices.

Cuba's government late last year put annual inflation at 70%, but at least three economists consulted by Reuters say the rate is between 300% and 500%. Soaring prices have squeezed consumers already hard hit by economic crisis and the pandemic.

The state controls most wholesale and retail trade in Cuba, offering the most basic goods in pesos and virtually everything else in MLC, while all wages are in pesos as are subsidized utilities and fuel. Health care and education are free.

Cuban officials in December said they hoped to ease the burden by driving down inflation in the coming months, but sources told Reuters that the government was increasingly hobbled by the crisis.

Three foreign businessmen, requesting anonymity, said that some government entities that had managed during most of the crisis to meet obligations to suppliers and other foreign partners were for the first time falling behind on payments.

""This has led people to realize the situation continues to deteriorate and MLCs, like the peso or letters of credit, have no real backing so there is a flight to exchangeable currency,"" one of the businessmen said.

That flight, they said, has further weakened the peso.

The government, meanwhile, had pinned its hopes of 4% growth in 2022 on the recovery of the Caribbean island's all-important tourism sector.

“I think there was an expectation that the reopening of borders, airports, hotels, and travel would bring in more dollars and improvements in the economy, and that was holding back a further depreciation of the Cuban peso,” Pavel Vidal, a former economist at Cuba's central bank, said.

“But this recovery is turning out to be slower than expected and there is great pessimism everywhere, which is expressed in the exchange rate,” Vidal, who currently teaches at Colombia's Pontificia Universidad Javeriana Cali, said.

In response to questions on Twitter -- first spurred by a conversation on live radio -- Taco Bell Canada confirmed that fans' suspicions were true, and it's pulling out of Quebec entirely.

The closest locations are now those in Hawkesbury and Cornwall.

The chain hasn't yet responded to questions about how many locations were left in the province or why it decided to close them.

However, Taco Bell was relatively late in arriving in Quebec, only opening its first location, in the West Island, in 2007.

A marketing executive behind the expansion said the delay was because Quebec took its time getting used to Mexican food.

Ten years earlier, ""there would only be a few items like taco shells in grocery stores, but now you'll find an aisle full of Mexican food, and it's becoming more prevalent to cook Mexican food at home,"" said Annik Labrosse, who was then the Quebec marketing manager of Priszm, which had an exclusive licence on opening Quebec Taco Bell franchises, in a 2006 statement reported in Franchising.com.

They planned to open 20 to 30 locations at the time, and the first Montreal one was swamped with ""die-hard"" fans who were used to day-tripping to Ontario for their fix and waited in three-hour lines at the new shop, the outlet reported.

Like many major chains, there were extra headaches around operating in Quebec, including coming up with names in French and a French-language section on the company website.

Details of accounts linked to 30,000 Credit Suisse clients all over the world are contained in the leak, which unmasks the beneficiaries of more than 100bn Swiss francs (£80bn)* held in one of Switzerland’s best-known financial institutions.

The leak points to widespread failures of due diligence by Credit Suisse, despite repeated pledges over decades to weed out dubious clients and illicit funds. The Guardian is part of a consortium of media outlets given exclusive access to the data.

We can reveal how Credit Suisse repeatedly either opened or maintained bank accounts for a panoramic array of high-risk clients across the world.

Quick Guide Suisse secrets Show What is the Suisse secrets leak? Suisse secrets is a global journalistic investigation into a leak of data from the Swiss bank Credit Suisse. It comprises more than 18,000 bank accounts that were leaked to Süddeutsche Zeitung by a whistleblower who said Swiss banking secrecy laws were ""immoral"". The data, which is only a partial capture of the bank’s 1.5 million private banking clients, is linked to more than 30,000 Credit Suisse clients. The leak includes personal, shared and corporate bank accounts – holding, on average, 7.5m Swiss francs (CHF). Almost 200 accounts in the data are worth more than 100m CHF, and more than a dozen are valued in the billions. While some accounts in the data were open as far back as the 1940s, more than two-thirds were opened since 2000. Many of those were still open well into the last decade, and a portion remain open today. The Guardian was among more than 48 media partners around the world including journalists at Le Monde, NDR, the Miami Herald and the New York Times. They spent months using the data to investigate the bank, in a project coordinated by Süddeutsche Zeitung and the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP). They unearthed evidence Credit Suisse accounts had been used by clients involved in torture, drug trafficking, money laundering, corruption and other serious crimes, suggesting widespread failures of due diligence by the bank. It is not illegal to have a Swiss account and the leak also contained data of legitimate clients who had done nothing wrong. In its response, Credit Suisse said it ""strongly rejects the allegations and inferences about the bank’s purported business practices"". Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.

They include a human trafficker in the Philippines, a Hong Kong stock exchange boss jailed for bribery, a billionaire who ordered the murder of his Lebanese pop star girlfriend and executives who looted Venezuela’s state oil company, as well as corrupt politicians from Egypt to Ukraine.

One Vatican-owned account in the data was used to spend €350m (£290m) in an allegedly fraudulent investment in London property that is at the centre of an ongoing criminal trial of several defendants, including a cardinal.

The huge trove of banking data was leaked by an anonymous whistleblower to the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung. “I believe that Swiss banking secrecy laws are immoral,” the whistleblower source said in a statement. “The pretext of protecting financial privacy is merely a fig leaf covering the shameful role of Swiss banks as collaborators of tax evaders.”

The revelations may fuel questions over whether Credit Suisse’s challenges over the past few years are indicative of a deep malaise at the bank. Composite: Guardian/David Levene

Credit Suisse said that Switzerland’s strict banking secrecy laws prevented it from commenting on claims relating to individual clients.

“Credit Suisse strongly rejects the allegations and inferences about the bank’s purported business practices,” the bank said in a statement, arguing that the matters uncovered by reporters are based on “selective information taken out of context, resulting in tendentious interpretations of the bank’s business conduct.”

The bank also said the allegations were largely historical, in some instances dating back to a time when “laws, practices and expectations of financial institutions were very different from where they are now”.

While some accounts in the data were open as far back as the 1940s, more than two-thirds were opened since 2000. Many of those were still open well into the last decade, and a portion remain open today.

The timing of the leak could hardly be worse for Credit Suisse, which has recently been beset by major scandals. Last month, it lost its chairman, António Horta-Osório, after he twice broke Covid-19 regulations.

That capped an unprecedented year of controversies in which the bank became embroiled in the collapse of the supply chain finance firm Greensill Capital and the US hedge fund Archegos Capital, and was fined £350m over its role in a loan scandal in Mozambique.

This month, Credit Suisse became the first major Swiss bank in the country’s history to face criminal charges – which it denies – relating to allegation it helped launder money from the cocaine trade on behalf of the Bulgarian mafia.

However, the repercussions of the leak could be much broader than one bank, threatening a crisis for Switzerland, which retains one of the world’s most secretive banking laws. Swiss financial institutions manage about 7.9tn CHF (£6.3tn) in assets, nearly half of which belongs to foreign clients.

The Suisse secrets project sheds a rare light on one of the world’s largest financial centres, which has grown used to operating in the shadows. It identifies the convicts and money launderers who were able to open bank accounts, or keep them open for years after their crimes emerged. And it reveals how Switzerland’s famed banking secrecy laws helped facilitate the looting of countries in the developing world.

Disgraced executives, fraudsters, traffickers – clients

When Ronald Li Fook-shiu approached a banker to open an account in 2000, he is unlikely to have been viewed as a run-of-the-mill client. A former chairman of the Hong Kong stock exchange, he was one of the wealthiest people in the city, where he was known as the “godfather of the stock market”. But he was perhaps better known for the time he spent in a maximum security prison.

Li’s career had ended in disgrace in 1990, when he was convicted of taking bribes in exchange for listing companies on the stock exchange. However, a decade later Li was nonetheless able to open an account that later held 59m CHF (£26.3m), according to the leak.

He has since died, but his case is one of dozens discovered by reporters appearing to show Credit Suisse opened or maintained accounts for clients who had serious convictions that might be expected to show up in due diligence checks. There are other instances in which Credit Suisse may have taken quick action after red flags emerged, but the case nonetheless shows that dubious clients have been attracted to the bank.

Like every other bank in the world, Credit Suisse professes to have stringent control mechanisms to carry out extensive due diligence on its customers to “ensure that the highest standards of conduct are upheld”. In banking parlance, such controls are called know-your-client or KYC checks.

A 2017 leaked report commissioned by Switzerland’s financial regulator shed some light on the bank’s internal procedures at that time. Clients would face intensified scrutiny when flagged as a politically exposed person from a high-risk country, or a person involved in a high-risk activity such as gambling, weapons trading, financial services or mining, the report said.

Relationship managers were expected to use external sources to verify customers and their risk levels, according to the leak, including news articles or databases such as the Thomson Reuters World-Check platform, which is used widely in the financial services sector to flag when people are arrested, charged, investigated or convicted of a serious crime.

Rodoljub Radulović.

Such controls might be expected to prevent a bank from opening accounts for clients such as Rodoljub Radulović, a Serbian securities fraudster indicted in 2001 by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. However, the leaked data identifies him as the co-signatory of two Credit Suisse company accounts. The first was opened in 2005, the year after the SEC had secured a default judgment against Radulović for running a pump-and-dump scheme.

One of Radulović’s company accounts held 3.4m CHF (£2.2m) before they closed in 2010. He was recently given a 10-year prison sentence by a court in Belgrade for his role trafficking cocaine from South America for the organised crime boss Darko Šarić. Radulović’s lawyer did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

Due diligence is not only for new clients. Banks are required to continually reassess existing customers. The 2017 report said Credit Suisse screened customers at least every three years and as often as once a year for the riskiest clients. Lawyers for Credit Suisse told the Guardian these periodic reviews were introduced “more than 15 years ago”, meaning it was continually running due diligence on existing clients from 2007.

The bank might, therefore, have been expected to have discovered that its German client Eduard Seidel was convicted of bribery in 2008. Seidel was an employee of Siemens. As the multinational’s lead in Nigeria, he oversaw a campaign of industrial-scale bribery to secure lucrative contracts for his employer by funnelling cash to corrupt Nigerian politicians.

After German authorities raided the Munich headquarters of Siemens in 2006, Seidel immediately confessed his role in the bribery scheme, though he said he had never stolen from the company or appropriated its slush funds. His involvement in the corruption led to his name being entered into the Thomson Reuters World-Check database in 2007.

However, the leaked Credit Suisse data shows his accounts were left open until at least well into the last decade. At one point after he left Siemens, one account was worth 54m CHF (£24m). Seidel’s lawyer declined to say whether the accounts were his. He said his client had addressed all outstanding matters relating to his bribery offences and wished to move on with his life.

The lawyer did not respond to repeated invitations to explain the source of the 54m CHF. Siemens said it did not know about the money and that its review of its own cashflows shed no light on the account.

While Credit Suisse said in its statement it could not comment on any specific clients, the bank said “actions have been taken in line with applicable policies and regulatory requirements at the relevant times, and that related issues have already been addressed”.

In some instances, Credit Suisse is understood to have frozen accounts belonging to problematic clients. Yet questions remain about how quickly the bank moved to close them.

One client, Stefan Sederholm, a Swedish computer technician who opened an account with Credit Suisse in 2008, was able to keep it open for two-and-a-half years after his widely reported conviction for human trafficking in the Philippines, for which he was given a life sentence.

Sederholm’s crime first came to light in 2009, when police in Manila raided a storefront purporting to be the local chapter of the Mindanao Peoples’ Peace Movement, and discovered about 17 women in cubicles with webcams performing sex shows for foreign customers. He was convicted in 2011.

A representative for Sederholm said Credit Suisse never froze his accounts and did not close them until 2013 when he was unable to provide due diligence material. Asked why Sederholm needed a Swiss account, they said that he was living in Thailand when it was opened, adding: “Can you please tell me if you would prefer to put your money in a Thai or Swiss bank?”

Ferdinand and Imelda pillage the Philippines

Swiss banks have cultivated their trusted reputation since as far back as 1713, when the Great Council of Geneva prohibited bankers from revealing details about the fortunes being deposited by European aristocrats. Switzerland soon became a tax haven for many of the world’s elites and its bankers nurtured a “duty of absolute silence” about their clients’ affairs.

The custom was enshrined in statute in 1934 with the introduction of Switzerland’s banking secrecy law, which criminalised the disclosure of client banking information to foreign authorities. Within decades, wealthy clients from all over the world were flocking to Swiss banks. Sometimes, that meant clients with something to hide.

One of the most notorious cases in Credit Suisse’s history involved the corrupt Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos and his wife, Imelda. The couple are estimated to have siphoned as much as $10bn from the Philippines during the three terms Ferdinand was president, which ended in 1986.

Credit Suisse helped Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos open Swiss accounts under fake names. Composite: Guardian

It has long been known that Credit Suisse was one of the first banks to help the Marcoses ravage their own country and in one infamous episode even helped them open Swiss accounts under the fake names “William Saunders” and “Jane Ryan”. In 1995, a Zurich court ordered Credit Suisse and another bank to return $500m of stolen funds to the Philippines.

The leaked data contains an account that belonged to Helen Rivilla, an attorney convicted in 1992 for helping launder money on behalf of Ferdinand Marcos. Despite this, she was able to open a Swiss account in 2000, as was her husband, Antonio, who faced similar charges that were subsequently dropped.

It is hard to know how Credit Suisse could have missed the money-laundering case linking the couple to the corrupt Philippine leader, which was reported by the Associated Press. The couple, who could not be reached for comment, were able to hold about 8m CHF (£3.6m) with the bank before their accounts were closed in 2006.

One former Credit Suisse employee at the time alleges there was a deeply ingrained culture in Swiss banking of looking the other way when it came to problematic clients. “The bank’s compliance departments [were] masters of plausible deniability,” they told a reporter from the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, one of the coordinators of the Suisse secrets project. “Never write anything down that could expose an account that is non-compliant and never ask a question you do not want to know the answer to.”

The 2000s was also a decade in which foreign regulators and tax authorities became increasingly frustrated at their inability to penetrate the Swiss financial system. That changed in 2007, when the UBS banker Bradley Birkenfeld voluntarily approached US authorities with information about how the bank was helping thousands of wealthy Americans evade tax with secret accounts.

We are transparent, there is nothing to hide in Switzerland. Swiss Bankers Association

Birkenfeld was viewed as a traitor in Switzerland, where banking whistleblowers are often held in contempt. However, a wide-ranging US Senate investigation later uncovered the aggressive tactics used by UBS and Credit Suisse, the latter of which was found to have sent bankers to high-end events to recruit clients, courted a potential customer with free gold, and in one case even delivered sensitive bank statements hidden in the pages of a Sports Illustrated magazine.

The revelations sent shock waves through Switzerland’s financial sector and enraged the US, which pressured Switzerland into unilaterally disclosing which of its taxpayers had secret Swiss accounts from 2014. That same year, Switzerland reluctantly signed up to the international convention on the automatic exchange of banking Information.

By adopting the so-called common reporting standard (CRS) for sharing tax data, Switzerland in effect agreed that its banks would in the future exchange information about their clients with tax authorities in foreign countries. They started doing so in 2018.

Membership of the global exchange system is often cited by Switzerland’s banking industry as a turning point. “There is no longer Swiss bank client confidentiality for clients abroad,” the Swiss Bankers Association told the Guardian. “We are transparent, there is nothing to hide in Switzerland.”

Switzerland’s almost 90-year-old banking secrecy law, however, remains in force – and was recently broadened. The Tax Justice Network estimates that countries around the world collectively lose $21bn (£15.4bn) each year in tax revenues because of Switzerland. Many of those countries will be poorer nations that have not signed up to the CRS data exchange.

Banks that enable kleptocrats to launder their money are complicit in a particularly far-reaching crime. Composite: Guardian Design

More than 90 countries, most of which are in the developing world, remain in the dark when their wealthy taxpayers hide their money in Swiss accounts.

This inequity in the system was cited by the whistleblower behind the leaked data, who said the CRS system “imposes a disproportionate financial and infrastructural burden on developing nations, perpetuating their exclusion from the system in the foreseeable future”.

“This situation enables corruption and starves developing countries of much-needed tax revenue. These countries are the ones that therefore suffer most from Switzerland’s reverse-Robin-Hood stunt,” they said.

The whistleblower acknowledged that the leak would contain accounts that were legitimate and declared by the client to their tax authority.

“I am aware that having an offshore Swiss bank account does not necessarily imply tax evasion or any other financial crime,” they said. “However, it is likely that a significant number of these accounts were opened with the sole purpose of hiding their holder’s wealth from fiscal institutions and/or avoiding the payment of taxes on capital gains.”

It was not possible for journalists in the Suisse secrets project to establish how many of the more than 18,000 accounts in the leak were declared to relevant tax authorities.

Media partners in the consortium wrote to more than 100 Credit Suisse clients in the data, asking whether they had disclosed their Swiss accounts to tax authorities. Five confirmed they had done so. Six said they were not required to declare their Swiss accounts. No others replied.

Ferdinand Marcos may have been Credit Suisse’s most notorious client. He is arguably rivalled only by relatives of the brutal Nigerian dictator Sani Abacha, who is believed to have stolen as much as $5bn from his people in just six years. It has long been known that Credit Suisse provided services to Abacha’s sons, opening Swiss accounts in which they deposited $214m.

Credit Suisse was publicly contrite after being kicked off a sustainable investment index over the affair. “We understand that the index was not really happy with us being involved with Abacha – we were not happy ourselves,” a spokesperson said in 1999. “But we have addressed those problems and for several years we have taken internal measures to make sure nothing similar happens in the future.”

Banks that enable kleptocrats to launder their money are complicit in a particularly far-reaching crime. The consequences for already impoverished populations can be devastating, as state coffers are siphoned, basic standards are eroded and trust in democracy plummets.

Politicians and state officials are among the riskiest customers for banks because of their access to public funds, particularly in developing nations with fewer legal safeguards against corruption. Banks and other financial institutions are required to subject politically exposed persons, or PEPs, to the most stringent checks, known as “enhanced due diligence”.

The leaked Credit Suisse data is peppered with politicians and their allies who have been linked to corruption before, during or after they had their accounts. None are as well known as the Marcoses or the Abachas, but several wielded great power in countries from Syria to Madagascar, where they amassed personal fortunes.

They include Pavlo Lazarenko, who served a corrupt single year as prime minister of Ukraine between 1997 and 1998 before applying for an account at Credit Suisse. One month after pressure from rivals forced Lazarenko to announce his resignation, he opened his first of two Credit Suisse accounts. One was later valued at almost 8m CHF (£3.6m).

Lazarenko was later estimated by Transparency International to have looted $200m from the Ukrainian government, allegedly by threatening to harm businesses unless they paid him 50% of their profits. He pleaded guilty to money laundering in Switzerland in 2000, and was later indicted in the US for corruption and sentenced to nine years in prison in 2006 in relation to bribes received from a Ukrainian businessman.

His lawyer said those convictions did not relate to the theft of any money from the people of Ukraine. Lazarenko, who reportedly lives in California, has resisted returning to the country, where he still faces accusations he stole $17m. His lawyer said his Credit Suisse accounts had not been accessed for two decades and were frozen in connection with court proceedings against him.

It remains unclear why Credit Suisse allowed Lazarenko to open an account and deposit such huge sums in the first place, given his background; before entering politics, Lazarenko was a functionary in charge of a collective farm.

Monika Roth, an expert on money laundering and a professor at Lucerne University, said Swiss banks had for a long time struggled to properly challenge politicians and public officials who, after stints in public office on relatively modest salaries, turned up with huge sums to deposit. She said: “Nobody wants to have asked the question: how is that possible?”

Around the time it was doing business with Lazarenko, Credit Suisse appears to have also made inroads into the Egyptian political establishment under the dictator Hosni Mubarak, who was president for three decades until 2011. The bank’s clients included Mubarak’s sons, Alaa and Gamal, who established business empires in Egypt.

The brothers’ relationship with the bank spanned decades, with the earliest joint account opened by the brothers in 1993. By 2010 – the year before the popular revolt that ousted their father – an account belonging to Alaa held 232m CHF (£138m).

After the Arab spring uprisings their fortunes changed, and in 2015 the brothers and their father were sentenced to three years in jail by an Egyptian court for embezzlement and corruption. They say the case was politically motivated, but after an unsuccessful appeal Alaa and Gamal paid an estimated $17.6m to the Egyptian government in a settlement agreement that made no admissions of guilt.

Lawyers for the brothers reject any suggestion they were corrupt, saying their rights were violated during the Egyptian case, and 10 years of wide-ranging and intrusive investigations into their global assets by foreign authorities has not uncovered any legal violations. They added that their Swiss accounts had been frozen for over a decade, pending the resolution of investigations by the Swiss authorities.

Other Credit Suisse clients linked to Hosni Mubarak were the late tycoon Hussein Salem – who acted as a financial consigliere for the dictator for nearly three decades, amassed a fortune through preferred tender deals and died in exile after facing money-laundering charges – and Hisham Talaat Moustafa, a billionaire politician in Mubarak’s party.

Moustafa, who could not be reached for comment, was convicted in 2009 of hiring a hitman to murder his ex-girlfriend, the Lebanese pop star Suzanne Tamim – but his account was not closed until 2014.

Another Mubarak henchman linked to Credit Suisse’s banking services was his former spy chief Omar Suleiman. His associates are listed in the data as beneficial owners of an account that held 63m CHF (£26m) in 2007. Suleiman was a feared figure in Egypt, where he oversaw widespread torture and human rights abuses.

The data reveals Credit Suisse accounts held by several more intelligence and military figures and their family members, including in Pakistan, Jordan, Yemen and Iraq. One Algerian client was Khaled Nezzar, who served as minister of defence until 1993 and participated in a coup that precipitated a brutal civil war in which the military junta he was part of was accused of disappearances, mass detentions, torture and execution of detainees.

Nezzar’s alleged role in human rights abuses had been widely documented by 2004, when his account was opened. It contained a maximum balance of 2m CHF (£900,000) and remained open until 2013, two years after he was arrested in Switzerland for suspected war crimes. He denies wrongdoing and the investigation is ongoing.

If ordinary Algerians, Egyptians and Ukrainians have reason to complain that Credit Suisse may have aided nefarious leaders, their grievances pale in comparison with Venezuelans.

Reporters working on the Suisse secrets project identified Credit Suisse accounts linked to almost two dozen business people, officials and politicians implicated in corrupt schemes in Venezuela, most of which revolved around the state oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA).

“Corruption has always been around in PDVSA, in varying degrees and levels,” said César Mata-Garcia, an academic at the University of Dundee specialising in international petroleum law. “The words ‘Venezuela’, ‘PDVSA’ and ‘oil’ are an alarm bell for banks.”

If so, that does not appear to have stopped Credit Suisse acquiring clients later revealed to be involved in numerous US investigations and prosecutions linked to PDVSA and the looting of the Venezuelan economy.

One case involves two US-based businessmen with Venezuelan connections, Roberto Rincón Fernández and Abraham Shiera Bastidas, who in 2009 set about bribing officials in exchange for lucrative PDVSA contracts with the help of an associate, Fernando Ardila Rueda. Among those who allegedly received bungs were the energy vice-minister, Nervis Villalobos Cárdenas, and a senior PDVSA official, Luis De Léon Perez.

In 2015, US prosecutors began indicting the participants; court papers make repeated reference to payments into accounts in an unnamed Swiss bank. However, the leaked data reveals all five men had Credit Suisse accounts active at the time of the offences. Of the five, four have pleaded guilty. The exception, Villalobos, is resisting extradition to the US from Spain.

Some of the Venezuela-linked Credit Suisse accounts contained enormous sums; Villalobos had as much as 9.5m CHF (£6.3m) in his account and De Léon had as much as 22m (£15.5m). Rincón, the businessman paying their bribes, had more than 68m CHF (£44.2m) in his account as of November 2015, the month prior to his arrest.

‘How many rogue bankers before you become a rogue bank?’

When Credit Suisse’s ornate headquarters were constructed in the 1870s in Zurich, they were designed to symbolise “Switzerland as a financial centre”. More than 150 years later, Credit Suisse occupies the same grand premises and Switzerland remains a global offshore centre, much as it has done for the last 300 years.

It is only in recent decades that Credit Suisse, one of Switzerland’s oldest and most cherished banks, acquired its reputation for calamity. As one commentator observed earlier this week: “The bank boasts that its purpose is to serve its wealthy clients ‘with care and entrepreneurial spirit’, but at this stage most of them would probably be happy if it could just avoid yet another major scandal.”

Horta-Osório lasted less than a year before resigning last month. Shortly after Credit Suisse appointed its new chairman, Axel Lehmann, the bank reported a loss of 1.6bn CHF (£1.3bn) in the fourth quarter, in part because it had put aside more than 400m CHF (£320m) to deal with unspecified “legacy litigation matters”.

And there is no shortage of those. The scandals involving Greensill, Archegos and Mozambique bonds have dogged the bank over the past year.

Over the past three decades, Credit Suisse has faced at least a dozen penalties and sanctions for offences involving tax evasion, money laundering, the deliberate violation of US sanctions and frauds carried out against its own customers that span multiple decades and jurisdictions. In total, it has racked up more than $4.2bn in fines or settlements.

Some of the accounts in the leak remain open today. Composite: Guardian

603,603,https://www.pharmacytimes.com/view/large-scale-study-finds-eating-vegetables-does-not-protect-against-cardiovascular-disease,Large-Scale Study Finds Eating Vegetables Does Not Protect Against Cardiovascular Disease,"Sufficient intake of vegetables has long been recommended as part of a balanced and healthy diet to lower the risk of a multitude of diseases. However, a new study conducted by the Nuffield Department of Population Health at the University of Oxford, the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and the University of Bristol, did not find that a diet high in vegetables was effective in lowering the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD).

The study authors noted that data gathered from prior research are inconsistent in illustrating the overall effect of vegetable consumption on CVD. However, the results from the current study, which was published in Frontiers in Nutrition, show that higher consumption of cooked or uncooked vegetables is unlikely to affect the risk of CVD.

“The UK Biobank is a large-scale prospective study on how genetics and environment contribute to the development of the most common and life-threatening diseases. Here we make use of the UK Biobank’s large sample size, long-term follow-up, and detailed information on social and lifestyle factors, to assess reliably the association of vegetable intake with the risk of subsequent CVD,” said study co-author professor Naomi Allen, UK Biobank’s chief scientist, in a press release.

For the study, volunteers at the UK Biobank were interviewed from 2006-2010 about factors such as diet, lifestyle, medical, and reproductive history.

The investigators used the responses from 399,586 participants regarding their daily average consumption of uncooked versus cooked vegetables, analyzing the association with the risk of hospitalization or death from myocardial infarction, stroke, or major CVD. The investigators controlled for other potential confounding factors, such as socio-economic status and other dietary issues.

The study authors also sought to assess the potential role of “residual confounding,” which is whether other unknown factors or inaccurate measurement of known factors could cause a false statistical association between CVD risk and vegetable consumption.

The study found that the mean daily intake of total vegetables, raw vegetables, and cooked vegetables was 5.0, 2.3, and 2.8 heaped tablespoons per person, respectively. The risk of death from CVD was approximately 15% lower for those with the highest vegetable intake compared to the lowest vegetable intake.

However, this effect was significantly weakened when assessing other possible socio-economic, nutritional, and health- and medicine-related confounding factors. The study authors suggest that more precise measures of these cofounders may shed light on the residual effect of vegetable intake.

“This is an important study with implications for understanding the dietary causes of CVD and the burden of CVD normally attributed to low vegetable intake. However, eating a balanced diet and maintaining a healthy weight remains an important part of maintaining good health and reducing risk of major diseases, including some cancers. It is widely recommended that at least five portions of a variety of fruits and vegetables should be eaten every day,” said last author Dr Ben Lacey, an associate professor in the Nuffield Department of Population Health, in the press release.

On Feb. 1, the webpage included a subhead for the Trevor Project, describing it as “the leading national organization providing crisis intervention and suicide prevention services to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and questioning young people under 25.” The section provided the organization’s website, phone number and text line.

A few days later, on Feb. 5, the section was gone. Of the four suicide prevention phone or text lines, only The Trevor Project was removed.

Now, there are three crisis lines listed: the Suicide Prevention Lifeline, the Veterans Crisis Line and the Crisis Text line. The Trevor Project’s phone number is still included in a PDF of resources under “Parent and Youth Suicide Prevention” as it was previously, but it isn’t as easily accessible as the section that was removed was, and doesn’t state that The Trevor Project is an LGBTQ-specific organization.

The Health and Human Services Department has not returned a request for comment.

Sam Ames, director of advocacy and government affairs at The Trevor Project, said mental health is not a partisan issue, and removing suicide prevention resources from a government website “because they are specific to LGBTQ youth is not only offensive and wrong, it’s dangerous.”

“We’re talking about a group of young people who are more than four times as likely to attempt suicide compared to their peers,” Ames said, citing Trevor Project research. In another survey, the group found that more than 80 percent of LGBTQ youths said it was important that a crisis line include a focus on young LGBTQ people.

“Especially during this time of unprecedented political attacks against LGBTQ youth, we encourage all youth-serving organizations and government agencies to learn more about The Trevor Project’s lifesaving crisis services and to publicize them to the youth and families who most need support,” Ames said.

This isn’t the first time Texas officials have removed suicide prevention resources for LGBTQ youths — and The Trevor Project, specifically — from state websites.

In August, following criticism from one of Gov. Greg Abbott’s Republican primary challengers, Texas officials removed a webpage titled “gender identity and sexual orientation” and a page devoted to Texas Youth Connection, a program run by the Department of Family and Protective Services, which included a link to The Trevor Project.

The page on sexual orientation and gender identity still shows an error message. The Texas Youth Connection website also displays the same message that it did in October: “The Texas Youth Connection website has been temporarily disabled for a comprehensive review of its content,” the website says. “This is being done to ensure that its information, resources, and referrals are current.”

Patrick Crimmins, the director of communications for the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services, said in October that the review of the webpages “is still ongoing” and would not provide further comment about why the pages were removed. He has not responded to a request regarding when or whether the pages will be restored.

Cameron Samuels, a senior at Seven Lakes High School in Katy, near Houston, and an activist, said the removal of LGBTQ-specific resources from state websites is “part of this larger attack on LGBTQ youth in Texas.”

As an example of this “larger attack” — which Samuels, who uses gender neutral pronouns, said is causing widespread fear among trans people in Texas — they cited a directive issued last week by Abbott that called on the state’s child protective services agency to investigate the parents of minors who are receiving gender-affirming medical care for child abuse. Abbott’s directive also called on “licensed professionals” and the general public to report the parents of trans minors if it appears that they are receiving gender-affirming medical care.

Last year, the state Legislature considered 50 anti-trans bills, with Abbott signing one that bans transgender girls from competing on female school sports teams.

Samuels has also fought censorship of LGBTQ websites within their school district, the Katy Independent School District.

After student activism, they said the district removed its block on the website for the Montrose Center, a local LGBTQ group in the state, in December. In January, it removed restrictions on websites for three national organizations: the Human Rights Campaign, the largest LGBTQ advocacy group in the country; GLSEN, which advocates for LGBTQ students; and PFLAG, which supports LGBTQ people and their families, among other sites.

Samuels said the district has “remained insistent” that The Trevor Project continue to be blocked due to its chat function. But they noted that the chat feature is what allows students to message a trained counselor.

The district has not returned a request for comment, but an official told the Houston Chronicle in January that the Children’s Internet Protection Act has a requirement of “ensuring safe communications including electronic mail, chat rooms and other forms of direct electronic communications.”

“The Trevor Project website has a community space to ‘get advice and support within an international community for LGBTQ young people ages 13-24,’ which is available to anyone who chooses to ‘join now,’” said Maria Corrales DiPetta, manager of media relations for the district. “Minors communicating with adults, unmonitored, online is an area of concern for communication and chat rooms as outline in CIPA.”

Samuels said it’s disappointing to see Health and Human Services officials making decisions that “are very harmful to students and youth who they represent.”

“And this is in addition to the governor’s efforts to investigate parents of trans youth for child abuse and to remove LGBTQ books from school libraries,” they said. “It’s really concerning and disturbing to see this.”

606,606,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/tme-invisible-living-with-behcets-disease,Living with a Behcet's disease diagnosis,"Share on Pinterest Design by Medical News Today; photograph courtesy Savannah James-Bayly These symptoms, however, never struck enough damage to warrant more than a few days off and a roll of eyes from friends when I returned. I struggled to adequately express my sense of ill-being for much the same reason I struggled to express my emotions at that age. I felt an inadequacy of language when it came to these intangible, invisible, internal feelings. How do you accurately relate your experience to another human being when you can’t point to it and name it “cut” or “bruise”? For our emotional selves, we often turn to artists — musicians, poets, painters — to articulate these complex human conditions. What do you do when you need help expressing hidden physical pain? Unable to describe what I felt, I silently carried this uneasy sense of malaise — until it was so familiar that it became invisible, even to me. I first showed symptoms that I couldn’t discount at 17, when I developed my first genital ulcers. The doctor at the sexual health clinic clearly thought I was lying about not having had unprotected sex. The second time the sexually transmitted infection tests came back negative, he was so angered at being bested by the source of the sores that he swabbed a painful ulcer so hard that the nurse cried at his disregard for my obvious agony. The moment he left the room, she swept me into a hug and said she’d get another doctor to examine me.

The first time I ever heard the words ‘Behcet’s disease’ This doctor took a gentler approach, asking instead about other symptoms — did I often get mouth ulcers? Yes, endlessly. Headaches? Fatigue? Joint pain? Then he gave his suspected diagnosis: “Behcet’s disease.” It was the first time I’d ever heard the words. A rare autoimmune disease, Behcet’s affects around 600 people in the entire United Kingdom. However, this doctor had trained at a hospital in İstanbul, and Behcet’s is sometimes referred to as “Silk Road disease” because of its much higher prevalence in the region. Through the lens of his experience, the invisible cause of my suffering was clear. He told me to get a referral to a rheumatologist. Enter the rheumatologist whose “care” I first landed in. Despite the cyclical nature of many autoimmune diseases, he ignored my reported symptoms, even though I had documented them in detailed diaries. The lack of anything to present for him to examine seemed to make my suffering completely immaterial to him. I’d wish for the visible signs of Behcet’s before a visit — bad mouth ulcers, external genital ulcers, or the large, painful welts that would pop up sporadically under my skin — because I hoped they would validate the hidden symptoms I reported: joint pain, allodynia (the skin on my upper body was painful under the slightest touch), fevers, and fatigue. Humans have a fundamental desire to feel seen. Unable to accept what he could not see, it wasn’t just my illness that was invisible, I was made to feel invisible, too. In the next 6 months, my health deteriorated significantly. I didn’t seek medical help because it seemed futile. After weeks of being confined to bed with such severe ulceration I couldn’t walk and fevers so high I was incoherent, my flatmates, who’d been the kindest caregivers, knew things were too serious to deal with alone and called an ambulance.

A huge turning point Those 24 hours changed everything. The rheumatologist on call exhibited genuine compassion, as well as a determination to find a treatment plan that worked. She promised that I would remain her patient moving forward and that I could contact her at any time between our scheduled appointments if I felt I needed to be seen more urgently. She made my experience feel validated. It was a huge turning point for managing my condition. Rather than the physical dissociation that had enabled me to endure the pain, I was encouraged to reconnect with my body. With few visible warning signs, I had to learn to listen more carefully for the early whispers — before they turned into screams. I was in a better place to start managing my physical health, but still had a long way to go to emotionally process what this diagnosis really meant for my life. I had been through a huge physical and emotional trauma but had no scars to show for it. Common greetings, like “You look great,” created a sense of dysphoria, as my external appearance didn’t match the internal feeling of the battle raging in my body. It was a feeling I was familiar with. I’d been openly bisexual since my teens, but having then had a boyfriend for a number of years, I constantly felt the erasure of my queer identity in the eyes of others. Being perceived as straight and healthy brings real societal privileges, but misperception of your identity can also disconnect you from your sense of self. The choice was to accept that dissonance or learn to “come out” as having a chronic condition. Not long after leaving the hospital, I had a chance encounter that helped me take the first steps on that journey. I was traveling by train and had forgotten my railcard. At the time, I was on high doses of steroids that had a major impact on my ability to sleep, and the exhaustion left a thick mental fog. The ticket collector charged me the full cost of a new ticket, plus a fine. It was the straw that broke me. My emotions completely spilled over. On the train, three women, ranging in age from thirties to sixties, sat at my table. They asked if I was OK, and through my uncontrollable sobs, I shared that I was struggling with a chronic illness. It turned out that all three of them had invisible illnesses: One suffered with fibromyalgia, one had multiple sclerosis, the third had diabetes. For the rest of the journey, we shared our stories, and they made me feel less alone. The truth is, although rare diseases are individually unusual, they are collectively common. One in 17 people are affected by a rare disease at some point in their lifetimes. Most illnesses are invisible, too. And even for those in good health, these are not uncommon struggles. Everyone recognizes the feeling of being alone in company when you are dealing with something significant: a breakup, grief, a stressful situation at work.

Talking honestly about my symptoms I knew keeping silent was unsustainable, physically and emotionally. One of the biggest challenges of living with an unseen illness is that people don’t automatically make accommodations for you: socially, in the workplace, and also in public space. One issue was that when I did raise it, nobody knew what Behcet’s was. Sometimes I’d just say I had arthritis to try and capture the joint pain in a language that people were familiar with. Or, “It’s a bit like Crohn’s,” which more people had heard of and which politely alluded to an ulcerative element. I learned that even with mild joint pain, using a stick helped me through the day because it externalized an internal struggle — people would give up seats on the tube, friends would slow down when we walked together. Yet not feeling able to truthfully share what I was going through still made me feel distanced from people I’d previously felt close to. Oral and genital ulceration is a key feature of Behcet’s, but stigma and shame about the intimacies of our bodies meant that I’d shroud symptoms. I learned to love my body for all it had been through and what it had survived. As my confidence grew, and I saw the positive effects of speaking up, I wanted to free myself from that shame by talking honestly about my symptoms. Now, if people ask about Behcet’s disease, I am usually frank about it. Their discomfort when I list genital ulceration is their problem — it pales compared to the discomfort of actually enduring them! Now that my health is better managed, the main challenge is keeping it visible to myself. I had to learn not to ignore mild symptoms because your base level pain threshold adapts, and it can quickly escalate. To combat this, I keep symptom diaries so I can look at a whole picture. When you’re feeling well, it’s easy to forget to take your preventive medication. I have a huge folder of all my medical letters as a physical reminder of the invisible trauma. It stops the consequences of not taking care of myself from fading from memory.

Eighty-two dogs flew overseas during the study period to undergo MVR in Japan from September 2017 to March 2019. All dogs were in the passenger cabin during the flight. No quarantine period was necessary as they had fulfilled the requirements to enter Japan including a 6-month quarantine in their own country prior to the flight. Two dogs were excluded from the study because they underwent a second MVR. The numbers of dogs were as follows: Chihuahua 14, Maltese 15, Cavalier King Charles Spaniel 10, Mixed breed 10, Shih Tzu 9, Miniature Schnauzer 4, Toy Poodle 3, Yorkshire Terrier 3, Papillon 2, Pomeranian 2, American Eskimo 1, Bichon Frise 1, Beagle 1, Chinese Crested Dog 1, Dachshund 1, Havanese 1, Pekingese 1, and Spitz 1. The characteristics of the dogs, grouped by departure region, are summarized in Table 1.

On arrival in Japan, four dogs showed severe symptoms related to heart failure. Three dogs were diagnosed with pulmonary edema (one dog classified as ACVIM stage C and two with ACVIM stage D), and one with left atrial rupture (classified as ACVIM stage B2). After receiving treatment, two dogs with pulmonary edema recovered, and two dogs died; thus, the overall survival rate for the inbound journey was 97.5%. The dog that died of pulmonary edema was a 7-year-old Cavalier King Charles Spaniel that flew from eastern USA (total flight hour, 12 h). The dog that died of left atrial rupture was a 9-year-old Maltese that flew from western USA (total flight hour, 11 h).

The conditions of the dogs during the journey were reported through an arbitrary questionnaire administered to owners. Of the 80 dogs included in this study, 46 completed the questionnaires. Of the 46 dogs, 47.8% (22) of the dogs showed decreased activity levels before air travel (Fig. 1). Two of these dogs reported a further decrease in activity during the flight. In addition, two dogs with normal activity levels before air travel were reported to have decreased activity during the journey. A reduction in appetite was reported in 6.5% (three) of the dogs before the flight, but these dogs were stable during the journey (Fig. 2). In contrast, of the 43 dogs that had a normal appetite before the air travel, eight dogs showed a decrease in appetite during the journey. Cough and dyspnea were monitored during the journey. Cough was observed in 47.8% (22) of the dogs before the flight (Fig. 3). Of these dogs, 86.4% showed stable status during the journey. Two dogs showed exacerbation of coughing only during the flight, and one dog that developed pulmonary edema showed persistent coughing after arrival. Of the 24 dogs that had no coughing symptoms before the flight, one dog was observed with the symptoms only during the flight, and three dogs showed persistent coughing after the flight (including one dog with pulmonary edema). Regarding dyspnea, 28.3% (13) of the dogs had symptoms prior to the flight (Fig. 4). Of these dogs, 61.5% had stable respiratory status during the journey. Four dogs showed exacerbation of dyspnea only during the journey, and one dog that developed pulmonary edema showed persistent symptoms after arrival. Among the 33 dogs with normal breathing status before the flight, 11 were reported to have dyspnea observed only during the flight (including one dog with pulmonary edema) and five dogs were reported to have persistent breathing problems after arrival (including two dogs with pulmonary edema). Digestive symptoms, such as vomiting and diarrhea, were not reported during the flight.

Surgical survival rate and hospitalization period

Of the 80 dogs in this study, five did not undergo MVR. The reasons were death of two dogs after arrival, unfavorable preoperative screening results, or refusal of consent to surgery by the owner. Three of the 75 dogs that underwent MVR died postoperatively; thus, the surgical survival rate was 96%. In comparison, the surgical survival rate in 629 domestic dogs during the same study period at this facility was 94.3%. The average hospitalization periods were 7.3 days for the overseas dogs and 7.2 days for the domestic dogs.

Pre- and post-air flight laboratory test results

To search for the risk factors for dogs with MMVD on air traveling, an attempt was made to compare the laboratory results before and after the flight. Blood tests, radiography, and echocardiographic data before the flight could only be collected from a small number of dogs. In addition, the most recent data varied from approximately 1 year to a few weeks prior to the flight. Considering the fact that MMVD is a progressive disease, data within 4 months prior to MVR were used, since this was the average period for domestic dogs with MMVD awaiting MVR after the date of surgery was appointed. The medical records of 10 dogs were used in this study. Values related to heart failure were assessed, including heart size from echocardiography and hematocrit, total protein, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine levels from blood tests. Enlarged heart size based on the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine (ACVIM) consensus guideline7 was recorded in all 10 dogs prior to the flight, but was confirmed in only seven dogs at the time of initial examination after arrival. Dehydration (diagnosed if two of the following three criteria were met: hematocrit > 55.0%, total protein > 7.2 g/dl, or blood urea nitrogen > 29.2 mg/dl in blood test results) was not observed in any of the dog prior to the flight and was confirmed in one dog after arrival. This dog was reported with a decrease in appetite during the flight from the owner survey. As for azotemia (defined as blood urea nitrogen > 29.2 mg/dl and creatinine > 1.4 mg/dl from blood tests), two dogs had persistent blood levels concerning azotemia, one resolved at the time of examination, and two developed after arrival. One of the dogs with an elevation in blood levels concerning azotemia was the dog with a decreased appetite. The second dog was reported with exacerbation of coughing and dyspnea during the flight. For the two dogs with persistent blood levels of azotemia, diarrhea or a decrease in activity was observed during the flight. No symptoms observed during the flight were of common occurrence with a specific laboratory result. No data prior to flight was available for the assessment of the two dogs that died after arrival.","Full size tableOn arrival in Japan, four dogs showed severe symptoms related to heart failure.

610,610,https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/levels-and-trends-in-child-mortality-report-2021,Newborn Mortality,"Overview



Globally 2.4 million children died in the first month of life in 2020. There are approximately 6700 newborn deaths every day, amounting to 47% of all child deaths under the age of 5 years, up from 40% in 1990.

The world has made substantial progress in child survival since 1990. Globally, the number of neonatal deaths declined from 5 million in 1990 to 2.4 million in 2020. However, the decline in neonatal mortality from 1990 to 2020 has been slower than that of post-neonatal under-5 mortality.

The chances of survival from birth varies widely depending on where a child is born. Sub-Saharan Africa had the highest neonatal mortality rate in 2020 at 27 (25–­­32) deaths per 1000 live births, followed by central and southern Asia with 23 (21–­­25) deaths per 1000 live births. A child born in sub-Saharan Africa is 10 times more likely to die in the first month than a child born in a high-income country. Country-level neonatal mortality rates in 2020 ranged from 1 death per 1000 live births to 44 and the risk of dying before the 28th day of life for a child born in the highest-mortality country was approximately 56 times higher than the lowest-mortality country.

Causes

Most neonatal deaths (75%) occur during the first week of life, and in 2019, about 1 million newborns died within the first 24 hours. Preterm birth, childbirth-related complications (birth asphyxia or lack of breathing at birth), infections and birth defects caused most neonatal deaths in 2019. From the end of the neonatal period and through the first 5 years of life, the main causes of death are pneumonia, diarrhoea, birth defects and malaria. Malnutrition is the underlying contributing factor, making children even more vulnerable to severe diseases.

COVID-19 disease and newborn survival

The evidence on deaths directly attributable to COVID-19 infection is strongly age-dependent, with children and adolescents least affected. Children under-5 years represent approximately 2% of the global cases (2 231 276) and 0.1% of the global deaths (1902) (1).

Data from civil registration and vital statistic systems, health management information systems from 80 countries as well as specific country-wide monitoring systems (Mozambique and South Africa) indicate no significant deviation from expected mortality for this age group for 2020 and in some cases indicate fewer deaths than would be expected from historical data. As more data comes in from countries, and further analyses are performed, these results may change for 2021.

Priority Strategies

Most newborn deaths take place in low and middle-income countries. It is possible to improve survival and health of newborns and end preventable stillbirths by reaching high coverage of quality antenatal care, skilled care at birth, postnatal care for mother and baby, and care of small and sick newborns. In settings with well-functioning midwife programmes the provision of midwife-led continuity of care (MLCC) can reduce preterm births by up to 24%. MLCC is a model of care in which a midwife or a team of midwives provide care to the same woman throughout her pregnancy, childbirth and the postnatal period, calling upon medical support if necessary.

With the increase in facility births (almost 80% globally), there is a great opportunity for providing essential newborn care and identifying and managing high risk newborns. However, few women and newborns stay in the facility for the recommended 24 hours after birth, which is the most critical time when complications can present. In addition, too many newborns die at home because of early discharge from the hospital, barriers to access and delays in seeking care. The 4 recommended postnatal care contacts delivered at health facility or through home visits play a key role to reach these newborns and their families.

Accelerated progress for neonatal survival and promotion of health and wellbeing requires strengthening quality of care as well as ensuring availability of quality health services or the small and sick newborn.

Essential newborn care

All babies should receive the following:

thermal protection (e.g. promoting skin-to-skin contact between mother and infant);

hygienic umbilical cord and skin care;

early and exclusive breastfeeding;

assessment for signs of serious health problems or need of additional care (e.g. those that are low-birth-weight, sick or have an HIV-infected mother); and

preventive treatment (e.g. immunization BCG and Hepatitis B, vitamin k and ocular prophylaxis)

Families should be advised to:

seek prompt medical care if necessary (danger signs include feeding problems, or if the newborn has reduced activity, difficult breathing, a fever, fits or convulsions, or feels cold);

register the birth; and

bring the baby for timely vaccination according to national schedules.

Some newborns require additional attention and care during hospitalization and at home to minimize their health risks.

Low birth weight and preterm babies require the following:

if a low-birth-weight newborn is identified at home, the family should be helped in locating a hospital or facility to care for the baby;

increased attention to keeping the newborn warm, including skin-to-skin care, unless there are medically justifiable reasons for delayed contact with the mother;

assistance with initiation of breastfeeding, such as helping the mother express breast milk for feeding the baby from a cup or other means if necessary;

extra attention to hygiene, especially hand washing;

extra attention to danger signs and the need for care; and

additional support for breastfeeding and monitoring growth.

Sick newborns:

Danger signs should be identified as soon as possible in health facilities or at home and the baby referred to the appropriate service for further diagnosis and care;

If a sick newborn is identified at home, the family should be helped in locating a hospital or facility to care for the baby.

Newborns of HIV-infected mothers require:

preventive antiretroviral treatment (ART) for mothers and newborns to prevent opportunistic infections;

HIV testing and care for exposed infants; and

counselling and support to mothers for infant feeding. Community health workers should be aware of the specialized issues around infant feeding. Many HIV-infected newborns are born prematurely and are more susceptible to infections.

WHO response

WHO is working with ministries of health and partners to 1) strengthen and invest in care, particularly around the time of birth and the first week of life as most newborns are dying in this time period; 2) improve the quality of maternal and newborn care from pregnancy to the entire postnatal period, including strengthening midwifery; 3) expand quality services for small and sick newborns, including through strengthening neonatal nursing; 4) reduce inequities in accordance with the principles of universal health coverage, including addressing the needs of newborns in humanitarian and fragile settings; 5) promote engagement of and empower mothers, families and communities to participate in and demand quality newborn care; and 6) strengthen measurement, programme-tracking and accountability to count every newborn and stillbirth.

The $110 mil­lion round for Sci­pher Med­i­cine was led by Cowen Health­care In­vest­ments, and in­cludes ex­ist­ing big-name back­ers North­pond Ven­tures and Khosla Ven­tures — bring­ing Sci­pher’s to­tal fundrais­ing to $227 mil­lion.

The au­toim­mune-fo­cused biotech, orig­i­nal­ly com­ing out of an aca­d­e­m­ic col­lab­o­ra­tion in 2015, touts a blood test re­leased in 2020 as its first phys­i­cal prod­uct. Sci­pher has been fo­cused on tak­ing datasets and iden­ti­fy­ing a pa­tient’s “dis­ease sig­na­ture” — which as CEO Alif Saleh told End­points News is a mea­sure of gene ex­pres­sion da­ta in whole blood.

That gene ex­pres­sion da­ta “ba­si­cal­ly tells you with our plat­form and our tech­nol­o­gy where the dis­ease bi­ol­o­gy sits,” Saleh said. “So we see us­ing gene ex­pres­sion da­ta where that bi­ol­o­gy sits, which then al­lows us to see if there’s a drug that tar­gets that par­tic­u­lar sig­na­ture, and if so, like­ly that the re­sponse is very high. If not, if the drug doesn’t tar­get the dis­ease sig­na­ture, then like­li­hood re­sponse is very low.”

There is al­so a sec­ond part to Sci­pher Med­i­cine: a pre­ci­sion med­i­cine da­ta busi­ness. As Saleh put it, test­ing gen­er­ates a lot of mol­e­c­u­lar and clin­i­cal da­ta, so they are build­ing a data­base of the da­ta they are col­lect­ing for au­toim­mune dis­eases, which they share through part­ner­ships with phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pa­nies in the drug dis­cov­ery process.

The com­pa­ny an­nounced one such col­lab­o­ra­tion with Gala­pa­gos back in 2020 — with Sci­pher find­ing drug tar­gets for in­flam­ma­to­ry bow­el dis­ease us­ing its plat­form, and Gala­pa­gos hav­ing the op­tion to take those tar­gets in­to fur­ther de­vel­op­ment, clin­i­cals and com­mer­cial­iza­tion.

The aca­d­e­m­ic col­lab­o­ra­tion be­hind Sci­pher was helmed by co-founders Joe Loscal­zo and Al­bert-Las­z­lo Barabasi, who is a physi­cist at North­east­ern Uni­ver­si­ty. Loscal­zo, chair of the De­part­ment of Med­i­cine and physi­cian-in-chief at Brigham and Women’s Hos­pi­tal, had been work­ing for years on map­ping the “hu­man in­ter­ac­tome,” the set of pro­tein-on-pro­tein in­ter­ac­tions with­in hu­man cells.

And that map­ping project be­came the ba­sis for Sci­pher, de­vel­op­ing pre­dic­tive drug re­sponse tests.

Sci­pher’s cur­rent prod­uct, known as Prism­RA, looks at pa­tient re­sponse for specif­i­cal­ly an­ti-TNF drugs, and the biotech orig­i­nal­ly start­ed look­ing at that par­tic­u­lar drug class for rheuma­toid arthri­tis, like drug sales king Hu­mi­ra, Rem­i­cade and En­brel.

And akin to the fi­nanc­ing: The large check will fund the launch of more tests from Sci­pher’s pipeline at one new test a year for the next five years. The next one, sched­uled to re­lease some­time this year, is Pris­mUC for ul­cer­a­tive col­i­tis. The CEO al­so said that ad­di­tion­al tests for Crohn’s dis­ease and MS were in the works.

An IPO is in the cards for the di­ag­nos­tics com­pa­ny mov­ing for­ward, but with the way that the mar­kets are, the com­pa­ny is in no rush to get there.

“We will go when the mar­kets are ready, and we are ready,” Saleh said.","The $110 mil­lion round for Sci­pher Med­i­cine was led by Cowen Health­care In­vest­ments, and in­cludes ex­ist­ing big-name back­ers North­pond Ven­tures and Khosla Ven­tures — bring­ing Sci­pher’s to­tal fundrais­ing to $227 mil­lion.

The debunked 2018 article on website Health Nut News claimed that some 300 birds at a park in the Netherlands died because a 5G transmission mast was rolled out in the Hague. Fact-checking website Snopes found that no 5G test had occurred during the time of the starling deaths.

The study noted that individuals, who were found to be more immune to fake news, were more attuned to how data and statistics could be manipulated, and more conscious of advertisement labels that appeared besides search results.

They were less likely to rely on their instincts to determine whether the article was trustworthy.

On the other hand, those with less interest in the fact-checking process depended more on the look and feel of the website that contained the article, such as font size, layout and the presence of advertisements.

How 50 Singapore residents verified the news they read was the subject of the second part of an Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) study published on Wednesday (Feb 23).

The study, funded by the Ministry of Communications and Information, was conducted by senior research fellow and head of the society and culture department at IPS Carol Soon, and research assistants Shawn Goh and Nandhini Bala Krishnan.

The latest findings followed the first phase of the study, which focused on Singaporeans' susceptibility to false information and was published in December 2020. It found that nearly six in 10 people, out of more than 2,000 respondents, had encountered and believed false information.

The second phase, a qualitative study with a smaller sample size, looked at Singaporeans' news and information-seeking practices online and their responses to false information, to understand why some people were more immune to fake news.

Fifty interviews were conducted virtually or in person, between July and October 2020. The interviewees, who also took part in the first phase of the study, were a mix of age groups, gender, ethnicity, education levels and how savvy they were in discerning and trusting information.

During the interview, they were asked to spend five minutes doing their typical news information-seeking routine. They were then presented with the Health Nut News article and asked what they thought of it, without indicating that it was problematic.

Respondents were free to use the Internet to verify the information. Researchers observed the process and later asked participants to recount any thoughts and feelings that might have guided their activities.

In a media briefing on Wednesday, Dr Soon said they identified people who might be more susceptible to false information in Phase 1 of the study.

Jasmin Merdan/Getty Images A simple blood test may predict long-term risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

In a study of 4,000 healthy adults, scientists found that levels of lipids in blood plasma were linked to later development of both conditions.

Those with higher concentrations of certain blood lipids measured had a higher risk of either type 2 diabetes or cardiovascular disease.

Lipid profiling may be a cheap, fast way to predict risk, allowing changes to diet and lifestyle before conditions develop. In the United States, 1 in 10 people has type 2 diabetes. Someone dies every 36 seconds from cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the U.S., and CVD causes one-third of all deaths worldwide. Both conditions may develop slowly, and the symptoms are not always evident. Doctors assess a person’s risk of developing them by taking a patient history and observing current lifestyle factors. Now, a study led by Prof. Dr. Chris Lauber, of Twincore in Germany, has shown that lipids in blood plasma can predict future risk of type 2 diabetes and CVD. The method — known as lipidomic profiling — can provide a quantitative measurement of risk long before symptoms develop. “The authors of this study have added to the growing evidence that lipidomics profiling could very well usher in the next generation of detection of cardiovascular diseases as well as diabetes.” – Dr. Suneet Singh, Medical Director of CareHive.

Measuring blood lipids The longitudinal study included just over 4,000 healthy, middle-aged Swedish people from the Malmö Diet and Cancer-Cardiovascular Cohort . Participants ranged from 46–68 years at the start of the study. Around 10% had a body mass index (BMI) of more than 30. The researchers took one baseline blood sample from each participant. They then centrifuged these blood samples to separate out the plasma for analysis. Researchers measured concentrations of 184 different lipids in the blood plasma using mass spectrometry . They used these lipidomic profiles to calculate risk scores and assign participants into one of six risk groups. Dr. Singh told Medical News Today the study could add to previous methods of assessing risk: “This new approach allows for a novel framework of risk stratification which also allows for enhancement when used in conjunction with the measurement of standard clinical variables.” He did, however, note that there was little diversity in the study population: “It is advisable to continue to expand upon this research by increasing the patient population to include several more variables. This includes different patient ages, racial groups, ethnicities, and physical activity levels.”

Lipids and risk The researchers followed up participants for more than 20 years from baseline assessments made between 1991 and 1994. In that time, 13.8% of the cohort developed type 2 diabetes, and 22% developed CVD. For those in the highest risk groups, these values rise to 37% for developing type 2 diabetes and 40.5% for developing CVD as compared to the group averages above. People in the lowest risk groups had a decreased risk of developing both conditions. The researchers also found that people with high lipid risk scores had a much greater likelihood of developing obesity during the follow-up period. Obesity is a risk factor for both type 2 diabetes and CVD. The authors suggest that this risk-score-based approach could indicate the risk of both type 2 diabetes and CVD many years before disease onset. “[T]his earlier disease detection occurs at a time where the disease has not become clinically evident. As a result, researchers and clinicians can now take on diseases from a more proactive preventive lens and not simply one that starts at the treatment stage,” Dr. Singh commented.","Share on Pinterest Measuring blood lipids may help evaluate disease risk before symptoms appear.

Tuberculosis is an airborne contagious infection that can affect all tissues and organs such as lungs, bones, eyes and skin. Although it is possible to treat it thanks to scientific studies, tuberculosis continues to claim a serious number of lives across the world every year.

According to the WHO, an estimated 10.6 million people, including 1.2 million children, fell ill with the disease globally and 1.6 million died in 2021.

On March 24 each year, World Tuberculosis Day is observed globally to raise public awareness about the preventable and curable disease.

Tereza Kasaeva, WHO Global Tuberculosis Program director, said 2023 is a critical year to push forward the agenda toward ending the disease, as there are several high-level opportunities to raise visibility, increased political commitment and enhance investments for tuberculosis response.

""The theme of world TB day 2023 'Yes! We can end TB!', reflects this and aims to inspire hope and encourage high-level leadership, increased investments, faster uptake of new WHO recommendations, adoption of innovations, accelerated action, and multisectoral collaboration to combat the TB epidemic,"" Kasaeva said in a video message.

She said despite global efforts to fight tuberculosis, nearly 4,400 individuals lose their lives on a daily basis, and around 30,000 others become ill, ""while global efforts to combat TB have saved an estimated 74 million lives since the year 2000.""

People who suffer from undernutrition face a tripled risk compared to others. About 2.2 million cases in 2021 are estimated to be caused due to undernutrition.

More than 80% of deaths from the disease occur in low and middle-income countries.

Although it is seen in every region of the world, South Asia is at the forefront of the regions where tuberculosis was most common in 2021. According to the WHO report, 46% of cases in 2021 were seen in South Asia and 23% in Africa.

The WHO report pointed out that two-thirds of the worldwide tuberculosis cases in 2020 were seen in eight countries – India, Indonesia, China, Philippines, Pakistan, Nigeria, Bangladesh and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

After the WHO declared tuberculosis a ""global emergency"" in 1993, steps have been taken to combat the disease across the globe.

The United Nations has set one of its sustainable development goals to end the disease by 2030. Furthermore, the WHO has implemented the Tuberculosis Action Plan for the WHO European Region 2023-2030 as part of its end tuberculosis strategy.

The action plan aims to reduce incidence by 80% and deaths by 90% in the WHO European Region, including Türkiye.

Diagnosis and treatment services for tuberculosis are offered free of charge by all health institutions in Türkiye.

All drugs used in the treatment of tuberculosis patients are also supplied by the Health Ministry.","The number of deaths from tuberculosis is on the rise as the illness has been recorded as the world's deadliest infectious disease after COVID-19 in 2021, killing 1.6 million people, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

For birds, their efforts backfired.","A deadly 2006 E. coli outbreak traced to spinach from a central California farm prompted growers there to remove meadows and woods lining their fields, amid fears they harbored disease-bearing wild animals. It turns out that strategy might have done more harm than good.

Birds at California farms with wild habitat nearby were less likely to have disease-causing microbes in their feces, while they also fed less on farmers’ crops, scientists have learned. The new findings point to potential benefits of farming alongside nature, and the ways in which strategies aimed at fending off wildlife can have unexpected consequences.

The research suggests “that farming landscapes with natural habitat tend to be good for conservation, farmers, and public health,” said Daniel Karp, an ecologist at the University of California, Davis whose lab led the work.

The 2006 incident sickened at least 204 people in 26 states and Canada, including 104 who were hospitalized. Three people died. For a time, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommended not eating fresh spinach. Clues eventually led federal inspectors to a 2.8-acre field in San Benito County, a farm-dotted region just south of California’s Silicon Valley. There, they found the strain of E. coli in feces from nearby cattle and wild pigs, as well as river water.

The repercussions stretched well beyond the lone farm, shaking the fresh produce industry, especially in California. Among the new food safety measures adopted in the wake of the outbreak, farmers were pressed to fence fields and remove nearby strips of wild vegetation to reduce the presence of wildlife that might carry disease.

But Karp and his fellow scientists wondered whether such measures were really having the intended effect. To find out, they focused on one type of organism known to carry disease-causing bacteria – wild birds. Farmers often have a conflicted relationship with birds. One the one hand, they dine on pesky crop-eating insects. On the other, they can feed on those same crops or beneficial insects.

To tease apart the interplay of these different forces, researchers headed to 21 organic strawberry farms in Santa Cruz and Monterey counties armed with delicate nets known as mistnets. Between 2017 and 2019, the scientists captured more than 1,000 birds from 55 species and collected fecal samples. In the lab, they sifted through the DNA in the feces, looking for clues about what insects and plants they were eating, and what germs they carried.

At the same time, the researchers built maps of the farms and surrounding land, tracing the mosaic of crops and untended vegetation they described as “semi-natural habitat.”

The results showed that what turned up in a bird’s gut depended in part on the landscape where they were caught. Birds caught at a dozen farms classified as having relatively little surrounding natural habitat were more likely to have strawberry DNA in their feces, as well as Campylobacter, a bacteria that can cause diarrhea and vomiting in people, and, in rare cases, death, according to findings reported Feb. 22 in the Journal of Applied Ecology.

The presence of natural habitat stood out statistically as the most significant factor when it came to whether the benefits of wild birds outweighed the harms, according to the researchers. “Bird communities respond to changes in the landscape,” said lead author Elissa Olimpi, who was a postdoctoral scientist at UC Davis during the research. “As birds shift in response to management, so do the costs and benefits they provide.”

While it’s not clear exactly why more nearby natural habitat could be a plus, it’s possible that these areas provide more attractive food such as seeds and insects, prompting birds to ignore strawberries. The more heavily farmed areas could also support bird communities more likely to carry or transmit disease.

Among the different species, barn swallows got a “gold star,” thanks in part to their appetite for pests. The aerial acrobats catch insects on the wing and build mud nests in the underside of roof eaves. The American goldfinch, meanwhile, was at the other end of the spectrum.

The split among species suggest that farmers could take steps to encourage more beneficial birds. In addition to letting land grow wild, people could leave barn swallow nests unmolested and build bird boxes with entry holes small enough to let insect-eating birds enter to build nests, while excluding bigger, more harmful birds such as starlings, the scientists said. “The best we can do is understand how to take advantage of the benefits while reducing the harms,” said Olimpi. “Growers will tell you it’s impossible to keep birds off your farm.”

China intervenes, putting pressure on Moscow to compromise, warning that it will not buy Russian oil and gas unless it de-escalates. So Mr Putin starts to look for a way out. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian authorities see the continuing destruction of their country and conclude that political compromise might be better than such devastating loss of life. So diplomats engage and a deal is done. Ukraine, say, accepts Russian sovereignty over Crimea and parts of the Donbas. In turn, Putin accepts Ukrainian independence and its right to deepen ties with Europe. This may not seem likely.

Gastrointestinal symptoms are the most common nonmotor symptoms in a majority of patients PD, and researchers are exploring some of the underlying pathological mechanisms and risk factors that both PD and IBS share. PD is believed to have a prodromal phase, long before neuronal death occurs, and some studies have focused on the gut-brain axis to look for clues.

In this study, researchers searched 2 databases up until August 2021 for research that fulfilled 4 points:

Observational studies, including case-control or nest-control or cohort studies

Studies that looked at the association between IBS and the risk of PD

Risk estimates with confidence intervals (CIs) or adequate data were provided to extract the risk estimates

The work were published as part of a full text

Case reports, animal studies, and reviews were excluded.

From 192 articles, 6 were ultimately chosen for analysis, involving 58,645 patients with PD. Risk estimates from the individual studies were pooled using random-effects models.

Results showed the overall risk for PD in patients who had IBS patients was significantly higher than the general population (odds ratio [OR], 1.5; 95% CI, 1.29–1.75; P < .001).

However, older patients with IBS (≥65 years) appeared to have higher risk (OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.3–1.59; P < .001) compared with patients aged 40 to 64 years (OR, 1.32, 95% CI, 1.05–1.64; P = .017).

Subgroup analysis revealed no significant differences in risk between men (OR, 1.47, 95% CI, 1.3–1.67; P < .001) and women (OR, 1.51, 95% CI, 1.29–1.75; P < .001).

The authors said exactly how IBS may increase the risk for PD is not fully known, but several pathways may be involved, including the microbiota-brain-gut axis. In a murine model of PD, dysbiosis of the gut microbiota was needed before the development of neuroinflammation and α-synuclein-mediated motor deficits; in addition, human gut microbiome alterations have been noted in other studies.

The authors said the low-grade intestinal inflammation of IBS may assist the development of PD, as the levels of inflammatory markers in PD are significantly higher than in healthy controls and correlate with the level of intestinal neuronal α-synuclein.

IBS may appear decades before PD’s hallmark motor symptoms appear. Two of the studies included in this review found that the risk of PD was highest during the 2 years of follow-up after diagnosis of IBS.

The authors said their review had the usual limitations common to meta-analyses, such as the small number of included studies and the observational, retrospective nature. The possibility of confounders exists, such as family history or lifestyle influences.

However, the review also had several strengths, including the fact that ""the level of heterogeneity for the analyses was low, making the pooled results more convincing.""

Any unoccupied spots in the Republic’s stock of 256,000 beds in purpose-built dormitories (PBDs) were quickly snapped up, and rental rates began to climb. The Straits Times reported in January that companies which had to renew their workers’ tenancy agreements paid premiums of 30 per cent or more.

This came as sky-high rents for Housing Board flats prompted some employers of employment pass and Malaysian work permit holders to move their workers to PBDs, further fuelling bed demand, according to dorm operators.

“To my knowledge, the cost of housing workers at PBDs has increased by between $50 and $100 per bed,” said Mr Stanley Soh, 43, Ngee Cheng Electric’s human resources and operations manager. “Cost is one issue; another is availability of beds as most of the PBDs are full.”

Some companies sought permission from the authorities to install more beds in their industrial premises, known as factory-converted dormitories (FCDs), but were rejected, said Ms Jolene Teo, 59, director of Southern Airconditioning Engineering. The authorities said this was to minimise additional pressure on infrastructure such as the sewerage system.

It was thus good news when the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) told firms in February that these rules would be relaxed for up to three years in 13 areas around the island where new temporary workers’ dorms were previously disallowed.

Yet, while any easing helps, industry players said the small injection of beds from this policy tweak is unlikely to alleviate the current tight situation in the short term, especially as the worker accommodation industry here will soon undergo a major transition to meet enhanced legal standards.

They note that Singapore’s 53 PBDs are essentially operating at full capacity today, higher than the 88 per cent cited by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) at the start of the pandemic and the 60 per cent in April 2021, when new quick-build dorms (QBDs) and temporary quarters were completed to house workers in order to reduce dormitory density.

“There is unlikely to be any new dormitories coming up until 2025, hence bed supply will remain the same or even reduce,” said a spokesman for the Dormitory Association Singapore Limited (DASL), a trade body that represents the interests of dorm operators here.

Ms Teo said her firm is applying to expand the current number of beds in its Tagore Lane FCD, from 28 beds to 48 beds. But it also intends to bring in more workers, who will have to be housed off-site. To her knowledge, the monthly cost of a dorm bed has risen to around $450.

Majority of dorms to be licensed under expanded law

Come April 1, all foreign worker dorms housing seven or more workers must be licensed under the expanded Foreign Employee Dormitories Act (Feda).

Overnight, about 1,600 dorms will come under the law, compared with just the 53 PBDs today, giving MOM more levers to act against errant operators.","Any unoccupied spots in the Republic’s stock of 256,000 beds in purpose-built dormitories (PBDs) were quickly snapped up, and rental rates began to climb.

The department said the Defense Security Cooperation Agency notified Congress of the possible sale Tuesday.

Egypt asked to buy 12 Lockheed Martin-made C-130Js, each installed with four Rolls-Royce AE 2100D turboprop engines, as well as a dozen spare engines; GPS navigation systems; identification transponders; missile warning systems; countermeasure systems; and more.

Egypt wants to buy three SPS-48 land-based radar systems, spares, motor generators, repeaters, radomes and other equipment, the State Department said. L3Harris Surveillance Systems of Van Nuys, California, would be the principal contractor in this sale.

The State Department said selling Egypt these airplanes and equipment will benefit the U.S. by helping a key ally in the Middle East improve its own security, and help it better detect air threats. Egypt already operates SPS-48 radars, so the State Department expects it won’t have a problem adopting the new radars into its armed forces.

Selling the C-130Js would help Egypt airlift supplies, equipment and people to better support its forces on missions such as border security and anti-terrorism, respond to internal security threats, and provide humanitarian aid, the department added. The C-130s would also be used for maritime patrol as well as search and rescue missions.

626,626,https://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2022/january/transit-inequity-increased-during-pandemic,Transit Inequity Increased During Pandemic,"For many essential workers, public transit provides a vital connection to their workplace in a world otherwise on lockdown. Yet the risk of infection for these workers, who are more likely to be from a low income or ethnic minority group, has been given limited consideration.

Corey Harper(opens in new window) and Destenie Nock(opens in new window), assistant professors of civil and environmental engineering, along with Lily Hanig(opens in new window), a Ph.D. student in engineering and public policy, have shared preliminary results from a new study conducted using data from the Port Authority of Allegheny County(opens in new window). Their research showed that 4% of COVID-19 cases in the county were contracted on the bus or directly from a bus rider. More than half of these infections resulted from trips where busses were overcrowded beyond COVID-19 guidelines, an issue that the authors explored combatting by testing several possible mitigation policies.

When the pandemic hit the US, most people who could stay home chose to do so, as illustrated by the 80% drop in Port Authority ridership. However, for those without the benefit of alternative transport or staying home, the choice was often non-existent. People from a low-income group or ethnic minority disproportionately make up the essential workers deemed too important to stay home, forcing many to balance the risk of fatal illness against financial insecurity in a lose-lose calculation. People from these groups are also more likely to be found living clustered in the same areas and along the same bus lines.

Many public transit agencies, including Port Authority, have set passenger limits for busses to promote distancing. However, this leaves bus drivers who have met their capacity with a difficult choice: let more passengers on and increase everyone's risk of infection, or leave behind passengers who are likely on their way to fulfill an essential role. Facing such challenging circumstances, 12% of Port Authority trips from April to September of 2020 were over capacity.

These factors help create inequities in public transit that give individuals from low-income or ethnic minority groups less access to reliable transportation and place them at considerably greater risk of contracting COVID than their high-income or white counterparts. Nock and co-authors found that bus stops in the lowest earning areas of Allegheny County were about twice as crowded as those in the highest earning areas during that six-month period.

Having shown how economic and ethnic disparities fuel transit inequity, the team set about testing the effectiveness of crowding mitigation efforts to prevent similar discrimination when responding to future public health crises. While adding more busses would help meet any unmet demand from overcrowding, this option is very costly due to the need to hire an extra driver to fulfill these trips. However, they did identify two measures that would likely lower transmission rates on public transit, at much lower costs: dispatch longer, articulated busses instead of shorter ones, and supplement bussing by dispatching autonomous vehicles (AVs) to collect passengers skipped by busses that were at their capacity limit.

Articulated busses have multiple rigid passenger sections joined by a flexible, accordion-like joint that measures around 60 feet in length, rather than the more common 40 foot. More room for passengers means less risk of crowding. AVs could similarly be used to allow bus drivers to enforce capacity limits with the comfort of knowing that skipped passengers would still reach their destination, while AV passengers would be free of any risk from human contact.

Researchers found that both longer busses and AVs were similarly cost-effective, though their effectiveness changed under different conditions. While longer busses are most cost-effective under current circumstances and were increasingly dispatched by Port Authority during the pandemic, as ridership and infection rates increased, AVs outpaced articulated busses in potential for safety and cost-efficiency. Harper, Hanig and Nock's work shows that policies for confronting overcrowding in public transit during a public health crisis like COVID-19 are paramount for preventing the deepening of economic and ethnic inequities in public transit.","For many essential workers, public transit provides a vital connection to their workplace in a world otherwise on lockdown.

His stripped-down appearance is for a study called Pestexpo, for pesticide exposure, and its purpose is to observe the real-life work conditions of agricultural workers in field crops, greenhouses, apple orchards or vineyards.

Luis Grasa is a 70-year-old who worked all his life as a shepherd and farmer in Huesca, Spain. Eight years ago, Grasa was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, a progressive nervous system disorder that leads to shaking and difficulty with movement.

Student or retired? Then this plan is for you.

Based on data from more than 5,300 scientific reports and studies, experts concluded that pesticides could cause Parkinson's, among a range of other conditions (Photo: Ed Alcock/MYOP Le Monde)

Dutch farmer John Hutten is another example. His parents had a farm, and he became a farmer himself. Now he has a slightly bent posture, his left arm does not swing while walking, and he is more tired than usual.

Grasa's and Hutten's stories are anecdotal. They do not prove cause and effect, but researchers seem them as two examples of possible connections to pesticides.

A disease on the rise

Bas Bloem, professor of neurology at the Radboud University Medical Center in the Netherlands, is a world-renowned expert on Parkinson's and co-author of the recently published academic-paper The Emerging Evidence of a Parkinson Pandemic describing how the number of people with the disease doubled between 1990 and 2015 and is expected to double again by 2040.

""Parkinson's is one of the few diseases that increases,"" he said.

Bloem sees a clear link between pesticides and Parkinson's disease despite the difficulties in pinpointing causality.

""The problem is that if you lose dopamine-producing cells, you get Parkinson's disease"" said Bloem. But that is ""a process that can take many years.""

In June 2021, the world-renowned French research institute Inserm published a landmark report confirming that occupational exposure to pesticides was ""strongly linked"" to at least six serious illnesses.

Based on data from more than 5,300 scientific reports and studies, experts concluded that pesticides could cause Parkinson's, cognitive disorders, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and multiple myeloma – both cancers that affect white blood cells – prostate cancer, as well as certain respiratory system disorders.

The report confirmed preliminary conclusions published by Inserm eight years earlier.

Now studies in the field

Meanwhile, in the Normandy fields and apple orchards, or the vineyards of Bordeaux, the Pestexpo team has demonstrated that farm workers are much more exposed to pesticides than previously thought.

And worse - the protection equipment simply doesn't do the job. Perplexingly, in some cases, wearing coveralls or gloves might actually increase exposure.

""Farm workers are required to wear protective equipment but if they don't, it's their fault"", says researcher Isabelle Baldi. ""And this is unacceptable because it means that we are rejecting a collective responsibility that starts from the moment a substance is put on the market.""

Alain Garrigou, professor of ergonomics at the University of Bordeaux, found data showing that pesticides can pass through plastic at the intramolecular level - not only because of holes, tears, or seams in the clothing.

""Pesticides have an exceptional penetration capacity,"" said Garrigou. ""They are peculiar chemicals that are made to kill, but above all they are made to penetrate plant and animal cells.""

This phenomenon is called permeation. ""There is no such thing as dedicated pesticide protection clothing,"" said Garrigou.

Fifteen years ago, Garrigou and Baldi detailed their findings and worries in an ""alert note"".

But at the EU-level it took another seven years for the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), responsible for the assessment of risks linked to pesticides, to develop a new mathematical model for the prediction of operators' and workers' exposure.

That, however, is still based on confidential industry data and doesn't take into account the French findings.

An 'emotive stance'

EFSA acknowledges in its 2014 guidance, updated in 2022, that data is missing on many routine situations such as cleaning equipment and spraying in greenhouses.

Another apparent oversight was the Pestexpo studies: they were not mentioned, nor was the term permeation.

""The EFSA Guidance is based on well-conducted and validated experimental data,"" wrote EFSA in an email to this team of reporters. It ""is acknowledged that there is a high public concern about exposure to pesticides,"" the authority wrote.

French researchers published a scientific review of the guidance on the assessment of exposure of operators, workers, residents and bystanders in risk assessment for plant-protection products in late 2019.

But that was countered by the pesticides industry through its organisation CropLife Europe (formerly known as the European Crop Protection Association, ECPA).

In a letter to the journal Safety Science, the lobby group said the researchers had taken ""an emotive stance"" that was ""overstated at best and misleading at worst.""

CropLife Europe, declined an interview, but said in a written statement to Le Monde and EUobserver: ""We did not feel that it presented a balanced view, exaggerated the health risks for operators and over-emphasised reliance on assigned protection factors in the registration of pesticide products.""

No data, no problem

And so, as of today, only France and Italy regard Parkinson's disease as a possible direct consequence of working in the field and recognise it as an occupational disease.

But in Italy, only 10 out of 20 farm workers who requested it have received compensation for being ill with Parkinson's between 2016 and 2020. In France only 278 patients have received compensation. In Germany an advisory board has discussed the issue for 12 years, but without reaching a conclusion.

In Poland, the 2.3 million people employed in agriculture lead a healthy life – if official registers are to be trusted. Infections from tick bites account for 80 percent of compensation paid out to a total of 2,579 farm-worker cases. But there's been no compensation for illnesses linked to pesticides.

In Denmark the trade union 3F, which organises farmworkers, said they had never heard of illnesses caused by pesticides. In Sweden just three cases of compensation due to pesticides was paid out in the past five years.

While the active substances in pesticides are authorised at a European level, the commercial products themselves are approved by national authorities.

To our knowledge no pesticide commercial product has been denied access to the market based on the findings in the French scientific reports.

In the EU, there is no treaty article to support legislation regarding workers' health per se, and there are not even common rules on how these topics should be defined.

Eurostat, the EU's office of statistics, has created an experimental database on occupational disease. But not all member states take part. It mostly illustrates how difficult it is to compare the situation in member countries.

The European Agency for Safety and Health at work (EU-OSHA) is not able to provide information on national legislation or standards.

""At the moment, not even basic statistics are comparable across member countries,"" EU-OSHA press office said in an email.

One existing tool at the EU level is the European schedule of occupational diseases. It is a recommendation to member states to compensate workers for diseases from a specific list.

Asked about the correlation between pesticides and Parkinson's disease in 2017, the then acting commissioner for health and food safety, Vytenis Andriukaitis, told the European Parliament that there was ""no clear scientific evidence about [the] occupational origin of Parkinson's disease.""

The commission's position hasn't changed since, spokesperson Veerle Nuyts indicated by email. Hence Parkinson's disease does not appear on that list.

Making the victims responsible?

The EU nonetheless has an official ""vision zero"" approach to eliminating work-related deaths and a framework strategy for health and safety at work, adopted in June 2021.

""As one of these actions, the commission calls on member states to provide training to farmers (...) to increase their skills and awareness on the health and safety rules on farms, including safe use of chemical substances, in particular plant protection products,"" spokesperson Nuyts said by email.

So, should farm workers then be primarily responsible for their own safety?

Catherine Laurent, director of research at the French National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and Environment (INRAE), says no.

""Giving appropriate instructions to the workers comes only as the ninth possible measure,"" Laurent says referring to an EU-directive from 1989 aimed at encouraging safety and health at work.

For ergonomist Alain Garrigou, the pesticide authorisation system is a ""form of externalisation of the responsibility on the people who are its victims"".

Sociologist Jean-Noël Jouzel, director of research at the French National Centre for Scientific Research CNRS, is the author of Pesticides: How to Ignore What We Know. He says the ""safe use"" of pesticides is pure ""fiction"".

When EFSA was asked by us if they would comment on Jouzel's claim, the EFSA came back with a two-letter-word answer:

""No.""","Eight years ago, Grasa was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, a progressive nervous system disorder that leads to shaking and difficulty with movement.

High violence risk causes tremendous physical and mental burden on both patients and healthcare staff in the acute psychiatric ward. The long duration of high violence risk makes this condition a constant battle. Therefore, we sought to determine if there were any predictors of the duration of high violence risk or any interventions that may be effective. This study found that only age is a predictor of the duration of high violence risk among patients in the acute psychiatric ward, while patients with more severe schizophrenia or bipolar disorder have a longer high-risk period. Intramuscular injections of antipsychotics and benzodiazepines can temporarily reduce symptoms, but not the duration of high violence risk. For cases at high risk of violence, adequate treatment of the major psychiatric disorder is recommended. By understanding these factors, healthcare staff may be better equipped to prevent violent incidents, provide individualized care, and intervene more effectively.

Introduction

Violence behavior is frequent among psychiatric inpatients and exposes healthcare staff to significant physical and psychological burdens as well as significant social impact.1 Regardless of direct or vicarious exposure to aggression, the possible impact of healthcare workplace aggression may encompass adverse effects on quality, safety, and accessibility of care.2,3 Violence in the psychiatric ward is common and widespread, and prevention, de-escalation, and management of violence risk are important issues.4,5 Based on literature review, most previous studies focused on assessing the incidence of violence over time.

Although few risk factors actually predict future occurrence of violence accurately, and underlying mechanisms of violence are not well understood,6 certain statistical risk factors of violence have been identified, including male gender, diagnosis of major mental illness, history of violence, involuntary hospital admission, drug or alcohol abuse, antisocial personality disorder, and intellectual disability.7–14 Violence evaluation check lists, including the Brøset Violence Checklist and the Historical, Clinical and Risk Management-20 (HCR-20) instrument, show violence risk predictors as young age, relationship instability, employment problems, impulsivity, criminal history and so on. Also, current violence risk assessment tools have been developed for heterogeneous and non-psychopathic populations.15 However, the clinical use of violence risk assessment tools is not widely adopted, especially in Asia.16 Different violence risk assessment tools have significant differences in their predictive rates, and the same tool may have different predictive rates for violence in different regions.17 These factors make it difficult to integrate various studies.

Based on the statistics of our acute psychiatric ward, the total patient-days of hospitalization included in this study from 2016 to 2020 were 25,548 person-days. In addition, the total person-days of high violence risk were 1669 person-days, and there were a total of 20 incidents of physical aggression. According to some research,18,19 individualized nursing management based on the conditions of different patients can reduce the incidence of violence among patients. Our ward also provides relevant nursing management according to the degree of violence risk of different patients (see the Appendix ). Specifically, for patients with a higher risk of violence, the nurses will visit the patients more intensively and conduct stricter safety checks. At the same time, they will be more careful to keep distance and avoid being alone when contacting patients. From the above data combined with the nursing management mentioned above, it can be seen that the person-days of high violence risk have caused a tremendous physical and mental burden on the healthcare staff in the ward. Furthermore, from 2016 to 2020, there were 380 incidents of involuntary restraint and 842 incidents of involuntary isolation in this ward. Although not all of these incidents were related to violent events, they to some extent reflect the suffering of patients and the level of tension in the ward.

While education and training about preventing and minimizing workplace aggression toward healthcare workers may increase personal knowledge and positive attitudes among healthcare staff, the combination of education and training may not affect actual workplace aggression against healthcare workers.20 Preventing individuals with severe mental illness from committing violence may provide huge benefits in reducing the risk of violence, as well as protecting the victims of violence.1 In clinical practice, understanding the predictors of violence risk may provide healthcare staff with expectations of how quickly or slowly violence risk may decrease in clinical practice.

While numerous studies7–13,21 have described predicting the incidence of violence over a period of time, only a few have focused on differences in the duration of high violence risk between different profiles of high violence risk cases. This study aimed to analyze the data of high violence patients and their duration of high violence risk to provide a new perspective on violence prevention,14,22 de-escalation and management. The use of antipsychotic and benzodiazepine intramuscular (IM) injections was also analyzed to determine whether or not these medications decreased the duration of high violence risk. Results of these research objectives may be useful to help management personnel and clinicians arrange staffing of the ward, implement nursing principles for acute psychiatric care, and improve the efficient use of healthcare resources and individualized patient-centered care.

Methods

Study Design and Sample

This retrospective observational cohort study enrolled 171 patients treated in the acute psychiatric ward of Keelung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital between January 2016 and June 2020, and who were assessed daily by psychiatrists as having high risk of violence based on the ward-routine checklist of violence risk. Patients’ background data were collected from their electronic hospital records (including age, gender, diagnosis, education level, occupation, etc.), violence history, self-harm history, admission condition (involuntary admission, discharged against medical advice, etc.). Duration of high violence risk was defined as duration from the day a patient’s violence risk was evaluated as high, to the day the patient’s violence risk was de-escalated to moderate.

After data collection, 13 patients were excluded from analyses because of high risk of violence at discharge (discharge against medical advice or transfer to another ward or hospital), resulting in a final sample size of 158 patients. Subjects’ background information, medical history, and admission condition were analyzed to find possible predictive factors to predict duration of high risk of violence.

Ethical Considerations

The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the Keelung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (IRB No.: 202201395B0). The study met the standards of the Helsinki Declaration. Because the study used retrospective deidentified data, signed informed consent from patients was waived.

Subgroup Analysis

Subgroup analysis was also performed because the diagnoses of schizophrenia spectrum disorder and bipolar disorder represented the majority of the patient population. In subgroup analysis, subjects were grouped according to different diagnoses, disease severity, and whether or not they received IM injections of antipsychotics or benzodiazepine during high violence risk duration. Cases of schizophrenia spectrum disorder were further separated into four groups based on severity scores of the Brief Psychiatry Rating Scale (BPRS), which assesses 18 symptoms, with scores for each ranging from 1 to 7 based on severity. The total score of all symptoms ranges from 0 to 70 as follows: Ill > 25, Moderately ill ≥ 35, Markedly ill ≥ 50, Severely ill ≥ 70).23 Cases of bipolar disorder were separated into five groups according to severity scores of the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) based on mania symptoms, for which the total score ranges from 0 to 70, with higher scores indicating higher severity (Ill > 12, Minimal symptoms ≥ 13, Mild mania ≥ 20, Moderate mania ≥ 26, Severe mania ≥ 38).24

Differences Between Subjects with Different Disease Severity Levels

Further analysis was done to determine differences, as follows: (1) whether differences were found in the duration of high-violence risk by groups of different severity levels evaluated at admission; (2) whether differences existed in whether or not subjects receive IM injections during the period of high violence risk by groups of different severity levels evaluated at admission, and (3) whether differences were noted in the duration of high-violence risk by groups receiving IM injections or not during the period of high violence risk. Through these analyses, associations between the different severity groups were explored, including the administration of antipsychotic and benzodiazepine IM injections, and the duration of high risk of violence in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.

Measurements

All included patients were evaluated by psychiatrists for violence risk using the Ward-routine Violent Behavior Evaluation Scale. This checklist was developed by psychiatrists in the acute psychiatric ward of the study hospital. The scale includes 15 evaluation items, including violence history, physical signs, verbal signs, emotional signs, substance abuse, active suicidal behavior, etc. (See the Appendix ). The scale has three grades of violence risk—mild, moderate, and high— which are determined based on final scores of the above items. Mild violence risk was assigned to subjects with fewer than 5 evaluated items, moderate violence risk was assigned to subjects with 5–10 evaluated items, and high violence risk was assigned to subjects with 10 or more evaluation items.

Statistical Analysis

The duration of high violence risk as a continuous variable was collected using natural logarithm convergence to conform to the normal distribution test. Univariate analysis for each variable was performed. Backward selection method was used to avoid false positives and overfitting problems. Univariable and multivariable regression analyses were performed to compare groups and to determine meaningful predictors. Associations between the different degrees of disease severity, the administration of antipsychotic and benzodiazepine IM injections, and the duration of high risk of violence in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder were also evaluated by regression analysis to determine differences between disease severity and duration of high violence risk. The independent sample t-test was used to determine differences in high violence risk duration between groups with or without injections. Chi-square test was used to determine differences in disease severity between groups receiving IM injections or not. All statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). P < 0.05 was established as statistical significance.

Results

Subjects’ baseline demographic and clinical data are displayed in Table 1. Overall, 158 patients were included, with ages ranging from 17 to 89 (42.3 ± 14.5) and 62.0% males. Diagnoses included schizophrenia spectrum disorder (59.5%), bipolar disorder (21.5%), alcohol/substance use disorder (10.8%), autistic spectrum disorder (3.1%), and intellectual disability (10.8%). Other demographic data (lifestyle, education) can be found in Table 1. Patients’ admission conditions during hospitalization included involuntary admission (5.7%), discharge against medical advice (9.6%), and admission for more than 30 days. History of violence was 84.2%, self-harm 31.0%. Mean duration of high violence risk was 9.3± 8.0 days.

Table 1 Descriptive Statistics of Subjects’ Demographic and Clinical Characteristics

Univariate analysis of potential predictors of high violence risk duration revealed that associated variables were significantly associated with duration of high violence risk (Table 2), including age (B = −0.009, P = 0.036), BMI (B = −0.016, P = 0.153), self-harm history (B = 0.227, P = 0.079), history of discharge against medical advice (B = 0.371, P = 0.068), and history of admission for more than 30 days (B = 0.170, P = 0.176). However, backward selection of potential predictors of high-violence risk duration showed that only age (B = −0.009, P = 0.028) was significantly associated with duration of high violence risk (Table 3).

In patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorder or bipolar disorder, those with higher severity levels had longer duration of high violence risk (Table 4). Schizophrenia patients who were markedly ill (P = 0.007) and severely ill (P = 0.001) had longer duration of high-violence risk than those who were mildly ill. In cases of bipolar disorder, those with severe mania had longer duration of high violence risk than those with mild mania (P = 0.040).

Patients who received IM injections of antipsychotics and benzodiazepine had longer duration of high violence risk than those who did not (Table 5). Among patients diagnosed as schizophrenia spectrum disorder, the group receiving antipsychotics and benzodiazepine IM injections during high violence risk had longer durations of high violence risk than the non-injection group (P = 0.001). Among patients diagnosed as bipolar disorder, those who received antipsychotics and benzodiazepine IM injections during high violence risk duration had longer duration of high violence risk than those who did not (P = 0.01).

No differences were found among high violence risk patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorder and bipolar disorder who had higher and lower disease severity whether or not they received antipsychotic and benzodiazepine IM injections (Table 6). Among patients diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum disorder, no differences were found between those receiving IM injections and those who did not between groups with different disease severity levels (P = 0.514). Also, among patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder, no differences were found between those receiving IM injections or not between groups with different disease severity levels (P = 0.056).

Discussion

In the present study, age was the only statistically significant positive predictor of duration of high violence risk. In addition, the data of high violence risk patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorder and bipolar disorder revealed that higher severity was associated with longer duration of high violence risk, and antipsychotics and benzodiazepine IM injections during hospitalization were also associated with longer duration of high-violence risk than those who did not receive injections. Also, no significant differences were found in the severity of illness and the administration of IM injections of antipsychotic and benzodiazepine or not during periods of high violence risk. It can be inferred that high violence risk patients diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum disorder and bipolar disorder require active treatment of the disease first. Although antipsychotics and benzodiazepines can temporarily calm patients, they do not contribute significant benefit to the long-term course of the disease or reductions in the duration of high-violence risk.25

Although multiple studies have shown associations between predicted risk of violence and diagnosis of major mental illness7,9,12 and violence history,11,13 these predictors were not significantly associated with duration of high violence risk in the present study. Therefore, as stated in previous studies,13,14,26 the causes of violence risk and its duration are complex, and it is difficult to predict the probability of violence behavior and the duration of high risk using simple variables.

In the present study, in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorder or bipolar disorder, subjects with higher disease severity had longer duration of high violence risk. A previous study reported high scores on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) or BPRS that appear to increase risk of aggression.21 Another study also found that persistent physical aggression before and during hospitalization was associated with higher overall BPRS scores.22

The most commonly used interventions in the management of violent patients are physical restraint, seclusion, and medication.27 Physical restraint and seclusion are shown to have no therapeutic value and may even contribute to post-traumatic stress, serious physical injury, and higher morbidity and mortality.28,29 In the present study, among patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorder or bipolar disorder who had high violence risk, those who received antipsychotics and benzodiazepine IM injections had longer duration of high violence risk than those who did not. The effects of IM injections on incident risk appear to be primarily short-term, and the risk never falls significantly below baseline risk.25

In high violence risk patients in the present study who had schizophrenia spectrum disorder and bipolar disorder, no significant differences were noted between higher severity and lower severity levels, whether or not patients received antipsychotic and benzodiazepine IM injections. This observation suggests that IM injections of these agents may achieve effective sedation for a short period of time to help protect patients and staff from physical injury and to promote the management of acute psychiatric wards. However, in order to reduce the duration of the high risk of violence, treating the major mental illness itself is the most important thing.

Psychiatric ward management varies corresponding to between-patient differences in violence risk. For patients with mild violence risk, nursing management principles recommend observing patients according to the principles of ward routines, conducting weekly security checks and implementing general nursing care principles. For patients with moderate violence risk, nursing management principles require managing not only mild violence risk but also conducting daily security checks, keeping a proper distance from the patient, using padded rooms, physical restraint or medication if needed, among other management methods. For patients with high violence risk, nursing management principles advise monitoring patients every 15 minutes, security checks every 8 hours, and to avoid approaching these patients alone. Overall, management of high violence risk involves much time, human costs, and psychological stress of the healthcare staff. Thus, determining the predictors of the duration of violence risk and developing possible strategies to de-escalate the violence risk to a lower grade are immediate and necessary.

The present study has several limitations. First, this study was retrospective and cross‐sectional in nature, which limit inferences of causality and generalization to other populations. Because of the limitations of medical records (such as between-patient differences in length of hospital stay and in comorbidities or medications), the variables in this study also have limitations, many of which are dichotomous variables, while more detailed polytomous variables are lacking. Also, data collection was only limited to the acute psychiatric ward of a single regional hospital, and the patient population was limited to patients with psychiatric diagnoses, so the data may not be applicable to other ethnicities and regions. Further, although this study discovered that higher severity levels may have longer duration of high violence risk in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorder and bipolar disorder, patients with higher severity levels and patients receiving antipsychotic and benzodiazepine IM injections may have longer duration of high violence risk; however, this study only found differences between groups, but not in associations between these variables or how they work. Future studies should consider the dynamic factors, such as patient’s current state and the context, and explore the potential for associations between different factors and duration of high violence risk. Another potential limitation is that the patients included in this study all had reductions in violence risk from high to moderate, which may lead to selection bias. Results of this study cannot be interpreted as a process from moderate to low risk of violence and from low risk of violence to release.

The other limitation of present study is that the ward-routine scale used to assess high-violence risk in this study was developed by the hospital psychiatrists themselves, and its reliability has not yet been tested. In fact, different violence risk assessment tools have significant differences in their predictive rates, and the same tool may have different predictive rates for violence in different regions.17 Little evidence is available to support the use of existing violence risk assessment tools for people with mental illness in China.30 Clinical use of violence risk assessment tools is lower in Asia than in Europe and North America.16 Therefore, developing a simpler, more accurate and appropriate scale of violence risk assessments for Asians is a top priority. The present study focused mainly on predictors of high violence risk based on patients’ conditions and did not include healthcare staff factors and environment of the psychiatric ward in the analyses. Violence behavior in the psychiatric ward has been linked to interpersonal styles of individual healthcare staff, a lower sense of fairness, and less involvement in the outside world.31 Although no strong causal relationships were found between design of the psychiatric ward and clinical outcomes, private spaces and intimate surroundings may contribute to patients’ health status.32 Therefore, these factors will likely be given more prominence and incorporated in future research of violence.

Conclusions

Results of the present study identified that only age is a predictor of duration of high violence risk among psychiatric patients. Other factors such as patients’ gender, diagnosis, education level, occupation, violence or self-harm history, and admission condition (involuntary admission, discharge against medical advice) were not associated with duration of high violence risk. For cases at high risk of violence, adequate treatment of the major psychiatric disorder is recommended. IM injections of antipsychotics and benzodiazepine may temporarily reduce symptoms, but not the duration of high risk of violence. In clinical practice, these findings support more efficient use of healthcare resources and more appropriate planning for different case characteristics, including de-escalation techniques, regular security checks, IM or oral forms of medications, restraint, isolation, and more. Finally, the causes of violence are complex, and more research is needed to complete causal and theoretical constructions. Future directions for further research include developing a simpler, more accurate and appropriate scale of violence risk assessment for Asians, and possibly analyzing more factors of the healthcare staff and psychiatric ward environment in relation to the duration of high violence risk. Other intervention variables, including physical restraint, de-escalation techniques and separate room isolation, could also be analyzed in the further research.","In addition, the total person-days of high violence risk were 1669 person-days, and there were a total of 20 incidents of physical aggression.
Duration of high violence risk was defined as duration from the day a patient’s violence risk was evaluated as high, to the day the patient’s violence risk was de-escalated to moderate.
Mild violence risk was assigned to subjects with fewer than 5 evaluated items, moderate violence risk was assigned to subjects with 5–10 evaluated items, and high violence risk was assigned to subjects with 10 or more evaluation items.
Chi-square test was used to determine differences in disease severity between groups receiving IM injections or not.

The findings were published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.

A post hoc analysis of the International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness With Medical and Invasive Approaches (ISCHEMIA; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01471522) was conducted. Recognizing that detection of 50% or wider diameter stenosis LMD has therapeutic and prognostic implications, the investigators sought to identify markers of LMD as detected on CTA, with the use of clinical and stress testing parameters. The analysis included randomized and nonrandomized participants from ISCHEMIA. Enrolled patients also had locally determined moderate or severe ischemia diagnosed via a nonimaging exercise tolerance test (ETT), stress nuclear myocardial perfusion imaging, or stress echocardiography, followed by CTA to rule out LMD.

Following stress testing and CTA, a total of 5146 patients who had not undergone previous coronary artery bypass grafts, and who had interpretable ischemia testing with the use of a modality other than cardiac MRI, were enrolled in the study. Overall, 8.0% of these individuals had LMD. The median participant age was 63 years and 74% of the patients were men.

Participants with LMD were significantly more likely to be men (P <.01), to be older (P <.001), to have an absence of previous MI (P <.009), to exhibit transient ischemic dilation of the left ventricle on stress echocardiography (P =.05), to exhibit maximum ST-segment depression on ETT (P =.004), and to have peak exercise metabolic equivalents attained on ETT (P <.001). The C-index for the clinical logistic model was 0.643. The C-index for the current model was marginally, but statistically significantly, improved compared with the clinical model, at 0.684 (P <.001).

A major limitation of the present study is the fact that the researchers analyzed left main stenosis via use of the 50% threshold; however, not all 50% to 70% left main stenosis may be flow-limiting. Further, exercise hemodynamic data were unavailable in a large number of patients with stress imaging.

The investigators concluded that the findings from the current study demonstrate that stress testing offers only incremental value over the use of clinical parameters for predicting LMD in patients with moderate or severe ischemia. “Thus, for most patients with moderate or severe ischemia, exclusion of LMD will require anatomical imaging with either CTA or invasive coronary angiography,” the investigators wrote.

New research from RCSI University of Medicine and Health Sciences has revealed that the link between 'bad' cholesterol (LDL-C) and poor health outcomes, such as heart attack and stroke, may not be as strong as previously thought.

Published in JAMA Internal Medicine, the research questions the efficacy of statins when prescribed with the aim of lowering LDL-C and therefore reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD).

Previous research has suggested that using statins to lower LDL-C positively affects health outcomes, and this is reflected in the various iterations of expert guidelines for the prevention of CVD. Statins are now commonly prescribed by doctors, with one third of Irish adults over the age of 50 taking statins, according to previous research.

The new findings contradict this theory, finding that this relationship was not as strong as previously thought. Instead, the research demonstrates that lowering LDL-C using statins had an inconsistent and inconclusive impact on CVD outcomes such as myocardial infarction (MI), stoke, and all-cause mortality.

In addition, it indicates that the overall benefit of taking statins may be small and will vary depending on an individual's personal risk factors.

The lead author on the paper is Dr. Paula Byrne from the HRB Centre for Primary Care Research based in RCSI's Department of General Practice. Commenting on the findings, Dr. Byrne says that ""the message has long been that lowering your cholesterol will reduce your risk of heart disease, and that statins help to achieve this. However, our research indicates that, in reality, the benefits of taking statins are varied and can be quite modest.""

The researchers go on to suggest that this updated information should be communicated to patients through informed clinical decision-making and updated clinical guidelines and policy.

This important discovery was a collaboration with Professor Susan M Smith, also of RCSI and with researchers from the University of New Mexico, USA, (Dr. Robert DuBroff), the Institute for Scientific Freedom in Denmark (Dr. Maryanne Demasi), Bond University in Australia (Dr. Mark Jones) and independent researcher Dr. Kirsty O'Brien.

An AI-generated image of Pope Francis looking extremely stylish in a large white puffer coat has gone viral on social media as it left viewers in shock and confusion.

The image, created by an AI (artificial intelligence) image generator, portrays the head of the Catholic Church wearing a pristine long-line puffer coat over his traditional white robes, with his cross on a chain dangling over his chest.

Many social media users, including Chrissy Teigen, have expressed confusion over whether or not the fashionable photograph is real or fake, as more realistic AI images portraying famous figures flood the internet.

In recent days, fake images of former US president Donald Trump, Russian president Vladimir Putin, actor Will Smith and more have been created and posted on social media.

Reacting to the image of the Pope, Teigen tweeted: “I thought the Pope’s puffer jacket was real and didn’t give it a second thought. No way am I surviving the future of technology.”

YouTube vlogger Keyon Elkins wrote: “The picture of the Pope in a puffer trench coat is AI????? I’ve been gagging all day and it’s not even real???”

One Twitter user declared: “Time to ban AI. I fell for that picture of the Pope looking dripped out in a puffer jacket. I feel like a WhatsApp aunty now.”

Others expresed concerns over how realistic the image is and how AI may affect people’s perceptions.

“The fact people find a picture of the Pope in a long puffy jacket thrilling is a good indicator AI is going to have a really easy time destroying humanity,” one person wrote.

Technology executive and US political adviser Lucy Caldwell added: “PSA that the photo that is making the rounds today of the Pope in a puffy white coat and that is activating many of you is not real.

“And, in conclusion, we’re going to need to get our acts together pretty quickly re: discerning what is real and what is not now that AI is here.”

Recently, AI-generated images showing Trump in prison and wearing an orange jumpsuit have spread across social media as the former president is under criminal investigation.

It comes after Trump predicted he would be arrested. The fake images have sparked concern among lawmakers and experts who fear it could spread harmful disinformation.","Read our privacy notice Thanks for signing up to theLifestyle Edit email {{ #verifyErrors }} {{ message }} {{ /verifyErrors }} {{ ^verifyErrors }} Something went wrong.

Image source, Getty Images Image caption, The war is being fought on mobiles around the world as well, as in the streets of Ukraine

Russia's invasion of Ukraine, it has been said, would be the first to introduce a new front line - the internet.

And cyber-attacks have been raging on both sides, with warnings things could escalate.

But a digital war is being waged in many other ways too - from questions about whether technology companies should block content to Russia, to online censorship, the spread of disinformation, and Ukraine's internet facing disruption as missiles fall.

What is going on in the cyber-war?

Image source, Getty Images Image caption, The Anonymous hacking collective has taken up cyber-arms against Russia

The Anonymous hacking collective has declared cyber-war on the Russian government.

Its claims should be treated with scepticism - but it has reportedly hacked state TV channels to show pro-Ukraine content.

There has also been hacking against Ukraine, with denial-of-service attacks hitting government websites and the emergence of what looks like ransomware without the ability to recover data.

This ""wiper"" malware - ""intended to be destructive and designed to render targeted devices inoperable"" - had been found in dozens of Ukrainian systems across the government, non-profit and information technology sectors, Microsoft said.

And the Reuters news agency reported Ukrainian officials had alleged a Belarusian cyber-spying operation was targeting personal email accounts belonging to Kyiv's forces.

In the UK, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng will reportedly hold talks with Paula Rosput Reynolds, who chairs the National Grid, amid fears of a wave of state-sponsored Russian attacks.

And the National Cyber Security Centre has called on organisations to bolster their online defences.

Although, its former head Ciaran Martin told the Guardian newspaper cyber had played ""remarkably little part"" in the conflict so far.

Is the internet still working in Ukraine?

Internet access is likely to be patchy during any conflict, as bombs and missiles damage networks and equipment.

And on Friday, heavy fighting in the city of Kharkiv saw significant disruption, according to NetBlocks, with connectivity to Ukraine's main internet provider, GigaTrans, dropping below 20% of normal levels.

Entrepreneur Elon Musk, responded quickly to calls for his satellite broadband service, Starlink, to be made active in the country. On Monday, Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine's Minister of Digital Transformation, confirmed the country had received crucial terminals required for the system to work.

The Starlink networks offers ""hope for connectivity in a worst-case scenario"", NetBlocks told BBC News. The BBC has not yet confirmed that Starlink is operational in the country.

""There is truly no silver bullet for staying connected in a crisis,"" NetBlocks added.

Meanwhile, Citizen Lab senior researcher John Scott-Railton tweeted: ""If Putin controls the air above Ukraine, users' uplink transmissions become beacons for air strikes.""

In the UK, mobile operators, including O2, Vodafone, Three and EE, have made mobile calls to Ukraine free, with no additional roaming charges for those in the country.

How is big tech responding?

Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Ukraine's deputy prime minister has called on big tech to join the fight

Pretty much as soon as Russia invaded, Ukraine's politicians began asking the big technology companies so many rely on for information and entertainment to play an active role in the war.

""We need your support,"" Deputy Prime Minister and Digital Transformation Minister Mykhailo Fedorov told Apple chief executive Tim Cook.

""In 2022, modern technology is perhaps the best answer to the tanks, multiple-rocket launchers and missiles.""

He also asked Meta to ban access to Facebook and Instagram in Russia.

But the company's head of global affairs, Nick Clegg, said this would prevent people there using them to ""protest and organise against the war and as a source of independent information"".

Mr Cook was also non-committal, saying Apple was supporting humanitarian efforts and remained ""deeply concerned"" about the conflict.

YouTube, meanwhile, has said it will halt several Russian channels' ability to make money - and limit recommendations to them

Parent company Google, the world's biggest ad seller, added it would not let Russian state media sell adverts using its tools.

And after consulting with regional authorities, it has disabled live traffic and information about how busy places such as shops and restaurants are

Facebook and Google have also restricted access to some state media accounts in Ukraine, at the request of the Ukrainian government, and banned downloads of Russia Today's mobile app.

Facebook has taken down a network run by people in Russia and Ukraine for ""inauthentic behaviour"", posing as independent news entities and creating fake personas across its channels.

And it warned about a hack called Ghostwriter accessing the Ukrainian military and public figures' social media, via email, to post disinformation.

Additional privacy measures rolled out in Ukraine had been enabled in Russia following reports of the targeting of people protesting about the war, the social network said, including:

letting users lock their profile to prevent others downloading or sharing it or their posts

removing the ability to view and search accounts' friends lists

sending everyone in Russia a notification about Instagram account security and checking their settings to make their accounts private

On Monday, Twitter announced that it would label tweets that link to content from state-affiliated Russian media accounts.

It also said it was taking steps to reduce the circulation of this type of content on its platform.

There will be debate about how big a role corporations should take in a war but some felt it was a moral imperative.

""It's appropriate for American companies to pick sides in geopolitical conflicts - and this should be an easy call,"" former chief security officer at Facebook Alex Stamos tweeted:

What is the situation in Russia?

Russia's government has imposed partial blockades on Facebook and Twitter, after clashes with the companies.

The country's communication regulator, Roskomnadzor, accused Facebook of ""violating the rights and freedoms of Russian citizens"", after Meta refused to stop fact-checking and labelling content from state-owned news organisations.

And NetBlocks reported Twitter had been heavily throttled across every major Russian telecom provider.

In addition to the five deceased, three others have been infected, according to a press release issued Tuesday by the World Health Organization (WHO). The global health body also noted that more than 160 additional people have been identified as contacts and are being monitored.

Tanzanian Health Minister Ummy Mwalimu said the cases were identified in the western region of Kagera and the government has managed to control the virus’ spread to other regions.

Meanwhile, neighbouring countries Uganda and Kenya say they are on high alert due to the recent cases. No confirmed cases have been reported in Canada.

Here’s what you need to know about the “highly virulent” disease.

WHO supporting Tanzanian government to end outbreak

Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO’s regional director for Africa, said in the press release that she is working with the local government to “rapidly scale up control measures” and end the outbreak “as soon as possible.”

“The efforts by Tanzania’s health authorities to establish the cause of the disease is a clear indication of the determination to effectively respond to the outbreak,” Moeti added. “The lessons learned, and progress made during other recent outbreaks should stand the country in good stead as it confronts this latest challenge. We will continue to work closely with the national health authorities to save lives.”

In a tweet issued Wednesday morning, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said his organization is “supporting the government to carry out epidemiological investigations — identify cases and contacts — and to provide them with care.”

Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease physician, told the Star outbreaks of the virus can linger if there is no rapid response in the countries its found, and as the virus typically has an incubation period of 21 days, it’s difficult to tell who is infected before symptoms start to develop.

“It’s more challenging to co-ordinate an epidemic response when (the virus) starts crossing international borders,” said Bogoch. “Hopefully they jump on this quickly, and get it under control quickly.”

Virus comes from same family as Ebola

MVD, which is fatal in up to 88 per cent of cases, was first detected in 1967 after simultaneous outbreaks in Germany and Serbia.

Fruit bats are believed to be the natural hosts of the virus, which can be transmitted to humans through “prolonged exposure” to mines or caves inhabited by these bat colonies, the WHO says. Among humans, MVD can be spread via direct contact with blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people.

Unlike with COVID-19, infected persons would have to be very close to another person for transmission to occur, said Bogoch, making the most-at risk people health care workers, family members of infected persons and others who have close physical contact with them.

MVD and Ebola are both members of the same family. The WHO says both diseases, though caused by different viruses, are “clinically similar” and “have the capacity to cause outbreaks with high fatality rates.”

Bogoch noted outbreaks of Ebola are not rare, referencing the 2014 outbreak that saw 30,000 cases in some African countries. Canada wound up banning travel or Visas to people from countries where the outbreak was going on, and travellers entering Canada were asked a series of questions before they could enter the country. But for the most part, life in Canada remained unaffected by the virus, Bogoch said.

He suspects the same for MVD, saying it’s currently a “regional issue” and not as transmissible as respiratory viruses.

“It’s still important that we acknowledge it and are aware, and support our friends and neighbours around the world if they need help or support quelling this with whatever they need — resources, support personnel.”

MVD difficult to diagnose due to similarity with other diseases

The onset of MVD is often sudden following an incubation period of between two and 21 days, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Initial signs include fever, chills, headache and myalgia. Symptoms may become more severe, leading to possible liver failure, massive hemorrhaging and multi-organ dysfunction, the public health agency noted.

But because the symptoms of MVD are similar to other infectious diseases, it can be difficult to diagnose.

There are currently no approved vaccines or antiviral drugs to treat the virus. However, the WHO says supportive care, including rehydration and treatment of specific symptoms, has been shown to improve rates of survival.

Previous MVD outbreaks have had high fatality rates

While this is the first outbreak of MVD in Tanzania, other countries have previously reported outbreaks. In February 2023, Equatorial Guinea confirmed its first outbreak of the disease, which the WHO noted was responsible for at least nine deaths in the small West African nation.

Ghebreyesus said in his tweet Wednesday that the WHO continues to support the ongoing MVD outbreak in Equatorial Guinea.

It’s unclear if the outbreaks in Equatorial Guinea and Tanzania are related, Bogoch said.

The largest outbreak of MVD recorded, according to the CDC, occurred in Angola from 2004 to 2005. Some 252 individuals were infected, of which 227 died.

MVD prevention in Canada and Ontario

There are currently no confirmed cases of MVD in Canada. According to Public Health Ontario, viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs), including Ebola and MVD, are not endemic to Canada. As well, the province has not reported a case of VHF since 2002, when the disease group was added back to the list as a “nationally notifiable disease.”

All suspected and probable cases of MVD must be immediately reported to the Public Health Agency of Canada. The agency said the National Microbiology Laboratory is the only facility in the country that can work with live hemorrhagic fever viruses.

They key to combating the virus is “rapid outbreak response,” said Bogoch.

“We know these can grow in size rather quickly if they’re not dealt with right away,” but Canadians don’t have much to worry about currently.

We recognize that some people who identify as male do not have the same anatomy as depicted in this article.

Crohn's disease is equally common in both sexes, but there are some unique symptoms and risks that men living with Crohn's may experience. Some of the complications that affect male health include issues with sexual dysfunction, bone density, cancer risk, and mental health conditions.

This article provides an overview of common Crohn’s disease symptoms and discusses risks specific to people with a male anatomy.

Signs and Symptoms

Crohn’s disease irritates and inflames the gastrointestinal tract (GI tract), the part of the body that runs from the mouth to the anus.

Symptoms of Crohn's disease may vary among patients, but it most commonly causes GI-related symptoms, including:

Abdominal pain and cramping

Frequent or urgent bowel movements

Bloating

Diarrhea



Intestinal gas



Nausea and vomiting

Fatigue

Weight loss

Because Crohn's disease affects the immune system (the body's defense mechanism against harmful germs), it can also lead to symptoms in other parts of the body.

Additional Crohn's symptoms can involve the eyes, skin, joints, gallbladder, nervous system, and blood vessels, and may include:



It's important to be aware of all potential symptoms that could point to Crohn's disease. If Crohn's goes undiagnosed and untreated, it can result in serious risks and complications.



Crohn's Across the Sexes Crohn's disease can affect both sexes differently. For example:

Women with Crohn's are more likely to experience symptoms that go beyond the gut, like joint, eye, and menstruation-related issues. They may also be diagnosed at an earlier age.

are more likely to experience symptoms that go beyond the gut, like joint, eye, and menstruation-related issues. They may also be diagnosed at an earlier age. Men with Crohn's are more likely to be diagnosed later in life. This may contribute to the development of different Crohn's symptoms and risks like sexual dysfunction, osteoporosis, and prostate cancer.

Diagnosis

Diagnosing Crohn’s disease can sometimes be challenging because its symptoms can look similar to other digestive conditions. Plus, there’s no single test that diagnoses Crohn’s.

After reviewing your symptoms and medical history and performing a physical exam, a healthcare provider will likely run several tests and work through a process of elimination to rule out other illnesses.

Some of these diagnostic tests may include:

Crohn's vs. Ulcerative Colitis Crohn's disease shares many symptoms with ulcerative colitis (another form of IBD), but they're not quite the same. The primary differences are:

Ulcerative colitis inflammation is constant and limited to the colon. Bloody stool is more common.

is constant and limited to the colon. Bloody stool is more common. Crohn's disease inflammation is ""patchy"" and can occur anywhere along the GI tract. Bleeding isn't as common during bowel movements.

It may take some time, but a healthcare provider can usually distinguish between the two after imaging and testing.



Risks for Men With Crohn's

Though men are just as likely as women to develop Crohn’s disease, they may experience different symptoms and risks. Crohn's disease can impact male health uniquely through complications that involve sexual dysfunction, bone density, cancer risk, and mental health conditions.

Sexual Dysfunction

It's not uncommon for adults with Crohn's disease to experience a change in their sex drive. Specifically, studies suggest that males with IBD are likely to experience certain sexual dysfunction symptoms, including erectile dysfunction.

This is likely due to a combination of factors. Experts think the inflammation in the body caused by Crohn's can contribute to a reduction in sexual desire and function.

Additionally, side effects, medications, surgeries, and the emotional toll that comes with Crohn's can affect self-image and sexual function.



Temporary Infertility

Research suggests that patients with IBD may have some reduction in fertility, and this might especially be the case for men with Crohn's disease.

A temporary form of male infertility is caused by an ingredient in Azulfidine (sulfasalazine), a prescription medication used to treat Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Studies show that roughly two months after stopping this medication, fertility returns.

Surgical procedures performed to treat Crohn's could also affect male fertility, particularly surgeries that involve incisions near the rectum, like proctocolectomy.

Osteoporosis

People with Crohn's disease have a greater risk for osteoporosis, a loss of bone density that can lead to fractures. This is because Crohn's patients often have multiple factors that can contribute to bone loss, including:

In the general population, osteoporosis is typically more common in older women than in men. But some research has found that men with Crohn's disease have an equal risk for osteoporosis, if not higher.



Prostate Cancer

Prostate cancer is another concern for men with IBD. One study found that men with Crohn's disease were up to five times more likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer compared to other men.

Experts believe the inflammation involved in Crohn's likely plays a role here. Other possible factors may include a lack of noticeable symptoms or delayed prostate cancer screening.



Depression

The mental and emotional impact of Crohn's disease can take as much of a toll as the physical symptoms. Research has found that rates of depression—a mental illness that affects a person’s mood, thoughts, and feelings—are higher in people with Crohn’s than in the general population.

Depression seems to be more common in people living with chronic illness, due to physical, mental, and emotional challenges. In addition, medications like steroids that are used to treat Crohn's disease can sometimes prompt mood changes or depression.

Keep in mind that depressive symptoms can present differently in each person and that research shows some men may be more reluctant to seek treatment for mental health.

Help Is Available If you or a loved one are struggling with depression, contact the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helpline at 1-800-662-4357 for information on support and treatment facilities in your area. For more mental health resources, see this National Helpline Database.

Treatment

There's currently no cure for Crohn's disease, but a number of treatment options are available to help reduce inflammation and keep your symptoms under control. These include:

Prescription medications

Over-the-counter (OTC) remedies

Dietary adjustments

Surgery

Complementary alternative medicine (CAM) therapies

In addition, understanding how Crohn's disease can impact men in different ways could lead to more effective treatment. The more you know about the early signs of Crohn’s disease, the quicker you may be able to seek a diagnosis and care.

Some experts are currently studying ways to implement sex-specific Crohn's management to help improve patient outcomes. This could include approaches tailored to male Crohn's patients who may be likely to experience sexual dysfunction, fertility challenges, osteoporosis, prostate cancer, or depression.

Crohn's disease looks and feels differently for everyone. Educating yourself on the various ways that Crohn's symptoms may present can help you take control of a potential diagnosis and your overall health. If you have any questions or concerns, speak to a healthcare provider if accessible, or check out resources like the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America, which offers local support groups throughout the United States.



Summary

Crohn's disease is a chronic condition that affects the digestive system. While Crohn's disease appears to affect both sexes fairly equally, men living with Crohn's may face a unique set of challenges with this condition. These include issues with sexual dysfunction, temporary infertility, osteoporosis, prostate cancer, and depression.

Each consortium member will exploit their respective operational and technological capabilities to expand the use of autonomous UA for the deliveries of maritime essentials to vessels at anchorage. During a nine-month pilot programme, the consortium will engage key customers for maritime UA deliveries, with the goal of establishing a UA delivery network capable of carrying parcel payloads up to 10kg.

ST Engineering will provide the UA technology using its end-to-end solution – DroNet; Skyports will jointly conduct the Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) flight operations with ST Engineering; while Sumitomo Corporation will provide go-to-market support, including their own fleet of vessels. All three partners in the consortium will undertake business development activities by leveraging their existing maritime network.

As a leading unmanned systems participant in Singapore, ST Engineering has been testing and developing autonomous solutions to enable BVLOS UA operations for shore-to-ship delivery in close collaboration with regulators and industry partners. Through funding support from the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore’ (CAAS) Call-for-Proposals, the Group recently completed the initial development of an UA system for shore-to-ship parcel delivery based on its in-house DroNet solution. A collaborative effort with Wilhelmsen Ships Service has helped to strengthen the commercialisation and operational aspects during solution development.

Compared to the traditional form of delivery by boats, UA operations can significantly slash response time and speed up turnaround for shore-to-ship delivery, in addition to reducing logistics costs. Replacing launch boat delivery with UA also helps to reduce carbon emissions and contribute to the maritime industry’s overall efforts to operate sustainably.

Teong Soo Soon, VP & Head of UA Systems at ST Engineering, said, “UA Systems have evolved rapidly in recent years to emerge as safe and robust alternatives to traditionally labour- and time-intensive missions. We are excited to be partnering Sumitomo Corporation and SkyPorts in the pilot launch of unmanned services for shore-to-ship parcel delivery after spending close to two years of R&D efforts to develop the solution. We look forward to being a strong enabler for customers which wish to leverage unmanned technology to inject higher efficiency and sustainability into their operations.”

Ichiro Tatara, GM, Commercial Aviation Department at Sumitomo, said, “UA systems are a potential infrastructure enabling sustainable transportation. We are very excited to launch a pilot programme for shore-to-ship parcel delivery together with ST Engineering and Skyports, and we believe this partnering is a great team and provides sustainable and efficient service to vessels in Singapore.”

Sanjay Suresh, Head of BD & Operations APAC, Skyports, said, “As home to one of the busiest ports in the world, Singapore is the ideal setting in which to demonstrate to customers the potential for UA to transform maritime logistics by moving essential supplies in a more cost-effective and sustainable way. Together with ST Engineering and Sumitomo Corporation, Skyports is excited to play a key role with our expertise in BVLOS UA operations in the continued expansion of our collective capabilities in the maritime sector.”

ST Engineering is showcasing its UA systems and other aerospace capabilities at the Aviation cluster of the ST Engineering Pavilion (G01) from 15 – 18 February at Singapore Airshow 2022.

641,641,https://theconversation.com/tb-in-children-isnt-being-controlled-its-key-to-fighting-the-disease-for-everyone-else-201966,TB in children isn’t being controlled - it’s key to fighting the disease for everyone else,"World TB Day on March 24th will commemorate the day in 1882 when Professor Robert Koch announced in Berlin that he had discovered the microbial cause of tuberculosis (TB), Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

Effective treatment for TB has been available since 1952. But it continues to be the world’s top cause of death from a single infectious disease.

In 1993 TB was declared a global public emergency of international concern and still is 30 years on. The focus at that time was on adult TB. At the time childhood TB was not thought to be important. Accurate evidence of the scale of the problem wasn’t available. Over the ensuing decade, thousands of African children died of TB and TB/HIV co-infection every year.

It took visionary leadership from African scientists and pathologists to conduct a large, landmark autopsy study in 2002 on 164 children who had died of respiratory illness in Lusaka, Zambia. The study found that 25% of deaths were due to TB. It was only then that the World Health Organization (WHO) recognised that TB in children was a neglected disease.

Despite that recognition, serious investment into early diagnosis, treatment and prevention of childhood TB have not been forthcoming. Systemic health services challenges and lack of adequate knowledge around the disease also hamper improvements.

Based on our combined four decades in TB research we believe that the burden of childhood TB can be one of the indications of a failing TB control programme in any setting.

In 2021, an estimated 10.6 million people fell ill with TB worldwide. This was made up of six million men, 3.4 million women and 1.2 million children. Of the 1.6 million people who died in 2021, 240,000 were children. Almost all were undiagnosed before death.

This reflects the dire need to prioritise childhood TB. Its early detection and treatment must be part of the global strategy to end TB.

Key challenges in childhood TB

Early diagnosis and treatment: The symptoms of TB in adults is fairly well described, leading to definitive diagnosis and treatment. But TB in children can easily be missed. This is because the symptoms are similar to other childhood illnesses. As a result, diagnosis and treatment are delayed.

Diagnosing TB in children is difficult for a number of reasons. The most vulnerable children present with non-specific symptoms. Chest x-rays are the textbook way to diagnose TB. But these are not always available in rural settings. There have been numerous studies evaluating new tests and algorithms. But the ideal test for childhood TB has not yet been found because the test must be easy to use at points of healthcare, affordable, with simple non-invasive sample collection.

TB vaccination: The age-old Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine remains the only licensed vaccine. It only provides some protection in early childhood. But it’s not effective in preventing active disease in older children and adults.

In many developing countries BCG vaccination for children after birth is mandatory. But vaccine coverage varies across countries. For national TB control programmes to work there must ensure high vaccination coverage.

New vaccine development for TB has not been a priority. There are 16 candidate vaccines that have reached proof of concept stage based on recent efforts. But more investment for facilitating their evaluation in clinical trials is required.

Funding to meet global targets: Adequate funding is required to fight childhood TB. The global targets set in 2018 aimed to treat 40 million people with TB disease between 2018–2022. This target included 3.5 million children with drug sensitive TB and 115,000 children with drug-resistant TB.

But progress in many areas of TB control have stalled – or been reversed. This has mainly been due to the COVID-19. This calls for renewed efforts to funding TB control adequately again.

In addition, US$ 1.3bn per year was needed to achieve these targets . US$ 2bn would go to TB research annually within the same five year period of 2018–2022. An assessment of the shortfall is urgently required as total investments into TB control globally fell from US$6.0 billion in 2019 US$5.4 billion in 2021, which is less than half what is needed annually.

Clinical practice and community prevention: Health workers in parts of the world including countries in Africa have limited knowledge and practice in managing childhood TB. Contact screening and family-centred approaches are an important part of reducing the burden of TB in childhood. It’s essential to improve understanding of childhood TB from training institutions and clinics – all the way down to the community.

Use of new technologies in testing and diagnosing childhood TB: Most children with TB present with negative results on microscopy of their respiratory fluids while radiographs are unreliable as they rarely definitive. GeneXpert is currently the most widely used tool for diagnostic accuracy of TB. But affordability and maintenance mean that it’s not practical to roll it out in settings that have few resources.

The best option in our view is metagenomic next-generation sequencing. This enables broad identification of pathogens and antimicrobial resistant genes directly from clinical samples within 24 hours. But these technologies are not readily available in low-middle income countries where the TB burden is the highest. Some children with respiratory symptoms may have mixed infections. Accurate diagnosis of multiple infections in a child will lead to proper management of the sick child with respiratory symptoms and reduction in mortality due to untreated infections including TB.

Next steps

To efficiently fight childhood TB, programmes must ensure the following:

good coverage of BCG vaccine

new, more effective TB vaccines need to be developed as well as enhancement of BCG

good clinical training and practice for managing patients

deployment of highly sensitive diagnostic methods

efficient community prevention programmes including contact tracing, and

proper treatment of diagnosed children.

Funders and donors should provide enough resources to enable global targets to be met. And enough money is required to mitigate the impact of emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic and economic downturns.","Despite that recognition, serious investment into early diagnosis, treatment and prevention of childhood TB have not been forthcoming.

Tara O'Neill Hayes, Rakeb Asres

Executive Summary

Poor nutrition is a key risk factor for numerous chronic diseases, most notably obesity, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and as many as 13 types of cancer.

These diseases reduce a person’s likelihood of working, and those who do work are less likely to work full-time and as productively as their peers without chronic disease.

The economic implications of nutrition-related chronic disease are primarily reduced wages, higher employment costs, and reduced government revenue.

This analysis estimates the economic cost of the four nutrition-related chronic diseases among 18 to 64-year-olds at $16 trillion from 2011-2020 (or nearly 9 percent of gross domestic product annually) after accounting for direct health care costs, lost productivity, and lost wages.

Introduction

Poor nutrition is more than a health care concern; it also has tremendous, multifaceted economic implications. Poor diet leads to numerous chronic diseases, often resulting in disability and premature death. This deprives individuals of their health and quality of life, as well as their productive potential, hindering their efforts to work full-time or at all, leading to lower wages. For employers, absenteeism, functional limitations among their employees, and the provision of health insurance pose tremendous costs. Nationally, the quality and quantity of the labor force determines economic output and government revenues. Simultaneously, demands for government resources increase as people incur greater health care costs and become more dependent on assistance when they are unable to work. Consequently, poor nutrition is a large and rapidly growing burden for the United States.

This analysis estimates the health and economic costs of the four most common nutrition-related chronic diseases—heart disease, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and as many as 13 types of cancer —among the working-age population. To do so, we estimate the health care costs directly associated with these diseases, the indirect costs due to lost productivity and lower wages, and lost government revenue resulting from those lower wages and reduced employment. This analysis estimates the total economic cost from 2011-2020 at $16 trillion, or nearly 9 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) annually.[i] Of note, this estimate does not account for premature death or reduced lifetime earnings, which other estimates suggest would significantly increase this cost.[ii] Further, it does not account for comorbidities often associated with these diseases, such as depression and chronic pain, which are also known to significantly decrease productivity.[iii]

Scope of the Problem

Poor nutrition is associated with the most common chronic diseases in the United States: obesity, heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and as many as 13 types of cancer (which account for 40 percent of all cancers diagnosed in the United States).[iv] Obesity now affects 42 percent of American adults, or 109.5 million individuals.[v] Even more Americans are estimated to have cardiovascular disease: 49.2 percent, or 126.9 million people in 2018; although, when excluding hypertension, this rate falls to 9.3 percent, or 26.1 million in 2018.[vi] More than 33 million Americans have type 2 diabetes.[vii] In 2018, there were an estimated 6.5 million people living with nutrition-related cancer.[viii]

Given that obesity is highly associated with each of these other diseases, there is significant overlap in the people who are affected by these diseases and thus simply adding up the prevalence for each would overestimate the number of people afflicted by nutrition-related disease.[ix] That said, it is estimated that at least 117 million American adults were living with nutrition-related chronic diseases as of 2017, many of whom will die prematurely as a result. In 2016, poor diet was the greatest risk factor for death in the United States and the third leading cause of morbidity, accounting for more than 500,000 deaths and 11 percent of all disability-adjusted life years lost (the number of years either lost or not lived in full health due to disability).[x] With the prevalence of obesity increasing at roughly 2 percent per year, this burden is expected to worsen for the foreseeable future.

Calculating the Costs

In estimating the health and economic costs associated with poor nutrition, this analysis considers the prevalence of the four primary nutrition-related chronic diseases among the working-age population (18 to 64 year-olds), the health care costs associated with each disease, the effect of each disease on a person’s likelihood of missing work or ability to be productive at work, the likelihood of being unemployed because of chronic illness, and the consequential impact on government revenues as a result of lower wages and the growing need for assistance.

Details regarding data sources and specific cost and prevalence considerations can be found in the Methodology appendix. Most prevalence figures come from government health agencies, while cost and productivity figures are sourced from available literature on the subject. Projections for economic costs are largely based on data from the Bureau for Labor Statistics.

Direct Health Care Costs

The incremental health care costs associated with each disease range from an estimated $2,500 for obesity (in 2017) to nearly $80,000, on average, for treating any of the 13 identified types of cancer. From a societal perspective, however, heart disease—at a cost of more than $20,000 per person—is the most expensive overall due to its prevalence. Although, when considering obesity as a risk factor for these (and other) diseases, it is estimated to be responsible for 44 percent of all direct health care costs in the United States.[xi] In total, between 2011-2020, these four diseases cost an estimated $7.6 trillion. Over the following three years (2021-2023), these diseases will cost an estimated $2.9 trillion.

These costs are borne by individuals, their employers, and the government, with variations largely dependent on whether or how individuals are insured. For those with employer-sponsored insurance, employers typically pay 70-80 percent of health care premiums, which are intended to cover the bulk of an average individual’s annual health care costs.[xii] Of course, individuals with any of these chronic conditions likely have higher-than-average costs and will likely face significant out-of-pocket costs. That said, many of these individuals are likely low-income, as having a low income is a strong risk factor for chronic disease.[xiii] As such, many who have nutrition-related chronic disease are likely covered by Medicaid, in which case most costs are covered by the government (state and federal). Two-thirds of Medicaid beneficiaries are overweight or obese, 28 percent have hypertension, and 26 percent report being in poor health.[xiv] The remainder are likely uninsured, in which case the individual would bear the brunt of the costs.

Indirect Costs: Lost Wages, Lower Productivity, and Reduced Revenues

The indirect costs associated with chronic disease similarly fall across the same parties. While there are manifold indirect costs, some of which are difficult to quantify, this analysis focuses on lower wages, productivity costs to employers, and foregone government revenues.

Individuals

The financial burden of chronic illness is felt most acutely at the individual level. The primary indirect cost is lost wages—whether from an inability to work at all or as much as one otherwise would if they were healthy. Household income and savings are invariably diminished, continuing the downward spiral of poor health and poverty. Studies estimate that chronic disease reduces one’s wages anywhere from 6 percent to as much 18 percent.[xv] This is felt distinctively by men and women in the workforce; women with chronic disease face a larger percentage reduction in wages, and men face a greater reduction in the number of hours worked.[xvi] This effect compounds over time: chronic illness will cost the individual progressively more as health care costs increase and the effect of missed promotions and raises flattens one’s lifetime earning potential. Individuals also lose out on the benefit of compounding interest when they are unable to save which may severely limit one’s financial stability in retirement.[xvii] Further, just as poor health can reduce employment and thus income, poor economic conditions can cause poor health. Unemployment is associated with reduced consumption of fruits and vegetables and increased consumption of snacks and fast food which may exacerbate existing health problems.[xviii]

Chronic disease also keeps many people out of the labor force altogether. One study found that chronic disease reduces employment by 5 percentage points, which translates to nearly 12 million fewer people working each year over the past decade.[xix]

Between the reduction in wages among those unable to work as much or to be as productive as they otherwise would and the foregone wages from an inability to work at all, it is estimated that that the overall reduction in wages due to obesity, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and nutrition-related cancer totaled $8.1 trillion between 2011-2020. Reduced wages among the working accounts for 28 percent of lost income. It is estimated that another $3.2 trillion in wages will be lost from 2021-2023.

Employers

Employers face costs due to reduced output when workers miss time at work (absenteeism) or are less productive at work because of limitations from their disease (presenteeism); although, these costs—particularly related to presenteeism—are often passed through to workers in the form of reduced wages, as discussed.[xx] In 2019, U.S. employers lost an estimated half a trillion dollars in productivity costs, resulting from 978 million days lost due to illness and another 540 million lost workdays due to underperformance on the job; note, however, that this estimate is for all chronic disease, not just those being considered here.[xxi] This analysis of the cost to employers is based on a study from 2008 that estimated the amount of time over the course of a year that individuals’ ability to work was adversely impacted due to various chronic diseases. Many studies have been done on this subject—some finding higher costs, some lower—but this analysis used this particular study because it included per-person costs for each of the four diseases considered here. Those costs are adjusted each year by changes in the average cost of compensation, just as was used in the original estimate.

Among obesity, heart disease, diabetes, and cancer, cancer tends to have the largest impact on an employee’s productivity as treatment can be a long and debilitating process. It was estimated that in 2008, employees with cancer cost their employers an average of $1,601 in lost productivity over the course of the year compared with $200-$300 for obesity, heart disease, or diabetes.[xxii] These estimates are based on an average of 54.9 hours of reduced productivity per year, per person with cancer, 11.2 hours per person with heart disease, 11.1 hours per person with diabetes, and 7 hours per person with obesity. Based on average annual prevalence over the past decade, and assuming an 8-hour workday, this totals 113.5 million days of lost productivity as a result of these four diseases, annually. After considering average annual compensation costs, this productivity loss cost employers $295.9 billion from 2011-2020. It is estimated employers will lose another $114.4 billion from 2021-2023.

Government

In addition to individuals and employers, federal and state budgets also suffer from nutrition-related chronic disease as the resulting lower wages and employment reduces government revenues. Using a simple average tax rate of 20 percent, this analysis estimates that between 2011-2020, government revenues were reduced by $1.6 trillion as a result of these four chronic diseases. Between 2021-2023, another $636 billion will likely be forgone. Note that these lost revenues are a share of—not in addition to—individuals’ lost wages.

Simultaneously, more people will require government assistance because of their lower incomes. So, while less money is coming in, more money must be spent, squeezing the budget from both ends.

Those who are unable to work because of diet-related illness may qualify for several federal assistance programs, either directly because of a disability or because of the resulting loss of income, including Medicaid, Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).

An estimated 3 percent of SSDI recipients have endocrine, nutritional, or metabolic diseases.[xxiii] Based on an average monthly payment of nearly $1,400 as of December 2021 and 280,000 recipients, these individuals receive assistance of roughly $4.6 billion annually.[xxiv]

There is strong evidence that SNAP is associated with obesity, although it is unclear to what degree SNAP contributes to obesity or whether people who are already obese are more likely to become SNAP recipients.[xxv] People who are disabled may be eligible for SNAP.[xxvi] Assuming 3 percent of disabled SNAP beneficiaries are disabled due to nutrition-related disease (the same as with SSDI) and an average monthly benefit of $216 per person, nutrition-related disability is responsible for an estimated cost of $280.8 million per year, as of 2021.[xxvii]

There are likely many others who are eligible for SNAP, Medicaid, and other income-related assistance programs because of nutrition-related earnings challenges as previously mentioned, though it is difficult to quantify how many.

Total Costs

In total, after considering increased health care costs, lost wages, lost productivity, and lost revenue (which is a share of lost wages), this analysis estimates that obesity, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and the 13 nutrition-related cancers identified cost the U.S. economy $16 trillion between 2011-2020. From 2021-2023, as prevalence continues to grow and costs escalate, it is estimated that the U.S. economy will lose another $6.1 trillion because of these diseases.

There are also other, sometimes less tangible costs incurred as a result of these diseases that are not accounted for in this analysis. For example, the stress and lost earnings incurred by family members who may have to spend time caring for a sick loved one. Poor nutrition early in life can cause underdevelopment of the brain resulting in mental and behavioral delays that could hinder one’s economic success later in life.[xxviii]

Conclusion

Poor nutrition has vast physical and economic consequences. Most Americans have a poor diet, leading to a high prevalence of various chronic diseases. These diseases may cause minor disruptions or hindrances to normal life for some while being severely debilitating for others. Overall, nutrition-related chronic diseases cause reductions in productivity, lost wages, and reduced economic output. This translates to reduced revenue for the federal government while simultaneously requiring more spending to treat the disease and provide economic assistance for those unable to work to their full potential because of illness. This analysis estimates that the overall economic cost of obesity, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and nutrition-related cancers totaled $16 trillion between 2011-2020.

Appendix: Methodology

This analysis focuses on four common chronic diseases most closely associated with poor nutrition: obesity, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and 13 types of cancer. Prevalence estimates are for those aged 18-64 to more closely reflect the working-age population. Prevalence and per-person health care cost estimates were sourced separately for each disease after a thorough review of recent studies:

Heart Disease

Obesity

Cancer (13 Types)

Diabetes, Type 2

Prevalence: CDC Diabetes Atlas (Total diabetes prevalence among 18 to 64 year-olds increased by 20 percent to account for undiagnosed, then reduced by 10 percent to isolate type 2)

Cost: American Diabetes Association, “Economic Costs of Diabetes in the U.S. in 2017” (costs attributed to diabetes for individuals under 65)

After obtaining health care cost estimates for a given disease in a given year, that base year estimate was increased or decreased by the annual percentage change in CPI-medical obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) for each year from 2011-2021. Projections for 2022-2023 were calculated using the average annual growth rate of 2.4 percent projected by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Office of the Actuary for the period 2019-2028.

In years for which data was not yet available, disease prevalence was estimated using the average growth rate from the years in the past decade for which data was available, except for heart disease, for which growth was projected at 1 percent consistent with projections from the American Heart Association and with population growth.

Productivity costs to employers are based on prior estimates from Journal for Population Health Management. The per-person cost calculated for 2008 in that study was increased by the annual percentage change in the average employer cost of compensation, published by BLS, the same source used by JPHM. Total employer costs were calculated by multiplying the per-person cost by the prevalence estimate for 18 to 64 year-olds reduced by 5 percent to approximate the number of individuals with the disease not working.

Revenue loss estimates are equal to 20 percent of estimated lost wages. Lost wage estimates were calculated for both those not working at all due to chronic disease as well as estimates of reductions in wages for those working with a chronic disease. To estimate the reduction in the number employed, the analysis assumed a 5 percentage point increase in the labor force participation rate and then used the unemployment rate for each year to estimate the number of people who would otherwise be working if not for their chronic disease. For those working with a chronic disease, it assumed wages would otherwise be 7.5 percent higher (this is considered a conservative estimate as estimates from the literature reviewed ranged from 6 percent to 18 percent). Average annual wages were obtained from BLS. To forecast lost wages for 2021, 2022, and 2023, the analysis used the Employment Cost Index from Wells Fargo‘s latest economic forecast to estimate wage increases, and assumed the labor force participation rate for 2022 and 2023 would be 63 percent (the recent historical average leading up to the pandemic), that the unemployment rate would be 3.5 percent, and accounted for expected increases in the adult population. Overall disease prevalence was estimated at 41 percent among working-age adults (with obesity, heart disease, diabetes, and cancer being among the most common chronic diseases).

*Important notice: medRxiv publishes preliminary scientific reports that are not peer-reviewed and, therefore, should not be regarded as conclusive, guide clinical practice/health-related behavior, or treated as established information.

Background

According to the authors, only two other studies investigated the physical and mental conditions of child care professionals in the US before this work. The one conducted in Indiana during the pandemic found that 63% of child care professionals experienced stress levels double the national estimate of 37% for US adults; another one conducted before the pandemic onset found that 36.8% to 62.1% of them experienced moderate to high-stress levels.

Since the well-being of child care professionals directly or indirectly influences children’s academic and emotional learning outcomes, it is crucial to address their condition during the pandemic and beyond.

About the study

In the current large-scale national-level study, researchers collected data of 81,682 child care professionals through an online survey, termed Qualtrics®, from May 22-June 8, 2020, for analyzing several physical and mental conditions.

They analyzed four physical health conditions - heart disease, asthma, diabetes, and obesity. Additionally, mental health conditions, such as depression and stress were also assessed. The study analysis accounted for their sociodemographic characteristics, including ethnicity/race, age, gender, child care type, medical insurance status, etc.

All the participants, self-identified as child care professionals, aged 18 years or more, resided in a US state or the Columbia district and consented to participate in the study. Of the 94,390 individuals who accessed the survey, only 82,613 met the inclusion criteria, from which 81,682 (98.9%) could provide requisite data for the analyses.

Study findings

The survey results showed that the mean age of study participants was 42.1 years; proportions of female, male and non-binary were 96%, 2.5%, and 0.3%, respectively.

Regarding the prevalence of asthma, 14.3% of child care professionals reported moderate to severe asthma, about 1.2 times the national average for US adult women. In contrast to asthma, the prevalence rates for diabetes, heart disease, and obesity at 6.5%, 4.9%, and 19.8%, respectively, were below national rates for US adult women.

A total of 37,376 participants had depression, and 66.5% reported moderate to high stress levels. The prevalence rate of depression within two to three months into the COVID-19 pandemic was greater than US national estimates of 16% to 36.1% before the pandemic, and notably also greater than 27.8% to 32.8% estimates for US adults during the pandemic.

The study analysis evidenced race, gender, and ethnicity disparities for physical health conditions of US child care professionals, but not in association with their mental health conditions during the pandemic.

Of all the physical health conditions examined during the study, the authors observed the most disparities for diabetes in all racial groups. Consequently, Hispanics appeared to be at higher risk of diabetes than White child care professionals. Among the non-binary child care professionals, the authors observed an increased risk of asthma and heart diseases.

Concerning the child care setting they worked for, professionals working in the federally-funded programs appeared to be at greater risk of diabetes and obesity compared to professionals working in for-profit child care centers. These findings showed no association whatsoever with the sociodemographic characteristics of these professionals.

Furthermore, the US child care professionals with asthma, diabetes, or obesity appeared to have greater access to health insurance irrespective of their age or other sociodemographic characteristics. Previous findings showing that individuals with medical insurance use clinical services and therefore receive a primary care diagnosis and treatment rationalizes this finding.

Shahid Akhter, editor, ETHealthworld, spoke to, Director and Vice Chancellor, Tata Institute of Social Sciences , Mumbai, to figure out the non-biomedical determinants and identify vulnerabilities underlying health issues If you remember, SDG 17 ( Sustainable Development Goal ) is about collaborations and partnerships, and I think in healthcare, more than anywhere else, collaborations and partnerships matter. Today, all of us probably complement each other's characteristics or competencies, and the problems are so unique and complex that one size does not fit all. Similarly, one solution also will not bring the kind of results desired. and therefore, we need to build multiple partners onto the same platform. The other issue that requires us to bring a partner is that we have recognised that most issues, including all diseases, have not just a biomedical side to them but also a non-biomedical side to them, which means that we bring social dimensions. These are interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary focuses, along with a medical approach. We need to work in teams. I think it is very important and critical to work in multidisciplinary teams and to work in a collaborative way.If we look at the TB issue, we recognise today that, despite treatment being available, we have not been able to control TB as a problem in the country. In fact, India has almost one-fourth of the world's TB burden. and that is because in the last several years we have only seen this as a bio-medical problem. Now, increasingly, we have realised that we need to understand that people had multiple issues before they had TB or as a result of TB. They have this problem, but they also lose employment at times, they fall into the poverty bracket, there is a huge stigma around the disease, and then there is the gender dimension: men have different consequences, but women have and face different consequences. There is a great deal of need for counselling to be done here. And counselling is not just about taking care of psychosocial issues but also linking them to health services, other government schemes, and so on. And all this requires that we work alongside biomedical providers. But then there are those that can provide psychosocial care; we also need to bring in community leaders; we also need to bring in peer members, that is, those who have survived TB, and they become champions and provide peer-based counselling. So this is one great example, and this is now happening in India.From our own example, we know that, as an academic institution, we are providing support to the government, that is, the Central TB Division, in the form of providing trained psycho-social counsellors , providing training for them, and being able to look at drug-resistant TB as one of the issues. In four states, we are providing psychosocial care and counselling to drug-resistant TB cases. In addition to that, we are also finding that public-private providers are also collaborating in TB care.The Tata Institute of Social Sciences is a community-engaged university and India's premier social science university. We have four campuses: Mumbai, Hyderabad, Tuljapur, which is a rural campus, and Guhati, in the northeast. This institute started as an institute for the professional training of social workers, but in the last several years we have grown to more than 50 PG programmes, four robust UG programmes, and 18 PhD programmes. And I think this is one of the only universities that has applied social science as its focus, and we have almost seven thousand students at this point in time, along with a school of vocational education. So a very multi-disciplinary social science university","Now, increasingly, we have realised that we need to understand that people had multiple issues before they had TB or as a result of TB.

People who want to fly from China to the United States will now have an easier time of it.

Special Covid testing rules for people traveling from China and its administrative areas, which were put in place on January 5 during a big outbreak of cases in China, were officially rescinded at 3 p.m. ET Friday, according to a news release from the US Centers of Disease Control and Prevention.

A source had told CNN earlier this week that the CDC order was expected to be dropped as soon as Friday.

What this means is travelers departing from China, Hong Kong, Macau and a few designated airports located elsewhere will no longer have to submit to a pre-flight test to get a negative result or show documentation of recent recovery from Covid-19 to board a flight to the United States.

The CDC said in its Friday news release that the order was put in place because of “concerns that Covid-19 cases were surging in the [People’s Republic of China].

“At that time, mitigation measures were largely not known to be in use in the PRC, and there were significant gaps in data and information on cases, hospitalizations and deaths.”

Why has the order been lifted now?

The CDC said it now has more confidence things have gotten better in China.

“Current available epidemiologic data through global data sets and modeling results indicate that the Covid-19 surge experienced by the PRC has returned to a baseline measure,” the release said.

The CDC also said that no variants of concern have emerged from China.

The agency said it will work with other agencies “to monitor travel patterns” between China and the United States and “adjust its approach as needed.”

Neuro-optometry is an expanding field, with more optometrists becoming more involved in diagnosis and management of some serious commonly presenting neurology-based diseases. Pilar Vergara, DOO, FCOVD, who is in practice in Albacete, Spain, Richard Castillo, OD, DO, from Tahlequah, OK, and Kelsey Moody Mileski, OD, FAAO, from the Marietta Eye Clinic, Marietta, GA, provided their take on these diseases.

Amblyopia: a paradigm shift

Pilar Vergara, DOO, FCOVD, described a new treatment paradigm for managing anisometropic amblyopia. She and colleague Robert Sanet, OD, developed a new protocol to sidestep the shortcomings of the current standard treatment, i.e., patching.

These drawbacks include resistance to wearing the patch, difficulty in school and play because of needing to use the amblyopic eye to process information and perform, disappointing outcomes with long treatment, long-term psychological effects on children and parents resulting from patching, and difficulty achieving 20/20 vision and maximal stereopsis, Dr. Vergara said.

In contrast to the old treatment protocol, which states that the main problem is reduced visual acuity, patching is the optimal treatment, and the optimal prescription is based on most plus to the best visual acuity, Drs. Sanet and Vergara have proposed a new neuroscience-based treatment for amblyopia.

And, indeed, they believe reduced vision is not the problem but only a symptom of the underlying binocular problem.

This thinking represents a paradigm shift.

They described their keys to success as follows: the timing and sequence of each step is crucial; the lens prescription is based on achieving maximal binocularity not maximal visual acuity; unequal adds are frequently prescribed; monocular fixation in a binocular field; optometric phototherapy; use of graded occlusion; and optometric vision therapy.

In cases that are less complicated, that is, defined as a best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 20/50 or better and anisometropia less than 6 diopters (D), using the new protocol, 80% of patients can achieve 20/20 vision and 20 arc seconds of stereopsis without needing any patching over 12 to 15 weeks.

In more complicated cases, defined as a BCVA of 20/50 to 20/200 and anisometropia of up to 8 D or more, most patients can achieve 20/20 to 20/25 vision and 20 to 30 arc seconds of stereopsis without any patching in a maximum of 24 weeks.

Drs. Sanet and Vergara can explain the neuroscience research behind their new model and the steps required to achieve better clinical outcomes. They have designed 2 courses that are currently available: A New Amblyopia Treatment Paradigm and No Tears Amblyopia Treatment-Quicker and Better Results without Patching.

Thyroid eye disease (TED): it takes a village

Dr. Castillo described the current knowledge about TED, which manifests most commonly as Graves’ disease (hyperthyroidism, however, also may develop in patients who are hypothyroid and euthyroid (normal hormone levels). The disease is complex, and patients can benefit from the expertise of a number of specialists and subspecialists.

The complexity of this disease is evidenced by the numerous attempts to classify its many manifestations. Presently there are no less than 5 classification schemes. Type I includes cases with minimal inflammation and restrictive myopathy, and type II moderate to significant inflammation and restrictive myopathy.

NO-SPECS includes 7 classes of TED ranging from class 0 with no signs of symptoms to class 6 with sight loss and optic nerve involvement.

The VISA classification, i.e., Vision, Inflammation, Strabismus, and Appearance, defines the vision, inflammation and congestion based on documented changes in inflammation rather than the absolute value, strabismus and motility with ductions and alignments measured, and appearance and exposure. A score of 5 or greater when using this classification indicates active disease or progression for which steroids should be considered.

The EUGODO classification defines mild disease as eyelid swelling and retraction and proptosis; moderate-to-severe disease as active disease that includes diplopia, proptosis of greater than 25 mm, and extraocular muscle dysfunction.

The classical clinical features of thyroid eye disease (Grave’s or hyperthyroid variant) include goiter, exophthalmos, and pretibial myxedema, Dr. Castillo explained.

The risk factors for developing ocular manifestations include increased age at onset, duration of hyperthyroidism, and smoking. These manifestations include eyelid retraction/proptosis, chemosis/conjunctival hyperemia, periorbital edema, diplopia, keratitis/exposure keratopathy, and compressive optic neuropathy.

Examination may reveal eyelid signs that include a staring appearance, lid lag on downgaze, lid retraction, incomplete and infrequent blinking, lower lid edema, and lower lid lag on upgaze.

The standard screening tests for Graves’ disease are thyroid stimulating hormone and free T4. The conventional treatments include beta-blockers, thioamide, radioiodine ablation; surgical approaches are thyroidectomy and TED-specific surgeries, i.e., orbital decompression, strabismus, lid lengthening, blepharoplasty; and most recently teprotumumab infusion (Tepezza, Horizon Therapeutics).

The clinicians involved in treatment include endocrinologists or internists, oculoplastic surgeons, strabismus surgeons, and neuro-ophthalmologists.

“Thyroid eye disease, whether due to the hyperthyroid, hypothyroid, or euthyroid state can be viewed as an immunologic derangement, and understanding the immunopathology involved helps explain the ocular manifestations of TED,” Dr. Castillo said.

Papilledema vs. pseudopapilledema: differentiating the two

Papilledema is a medical emergency and patients should be referred to the emergency room, according to Dr. Mileski.

The disease is characterized by optic disc swelling secondary to elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) that is bilateral in most cases. Elevated ICP causes headache, nausea, vomiting, diplopia, pulsatile tinnitus, and transient visual obscurations.

Papilledema can result from the presence of an intracranial mass, cerebral hemorrhage, meningitis, hydrocephalus, spinal cord lesions, obstruction of venous drainage, and idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). The presentations of these are similar, but all must be excluded from the differential diagnosis before IIH is diagnosed, she advised.

Patients with IIH have normal vision and color vision, possibly diplopia, an enlarged blind spot, and elevated retinal nerve fiber layer and neuroretinal rim on optic nerve optical coherence tomography (OCT). On dilated examination, the optic nerve appears elevated and swollen. Vessel obscuration, Paton’s lines, and hemorrhages may be present.

In contrast, pseudopapilledema is characterized by the absence of an optic disc cup, a small disc, vessel trifurcation, drusen, and spontaneous venous pulsation.

OCT can be useful for differentiating the two diseases by visualizing drusen and peripapillary wrinkles. Fundus autofluorescence (FAF) can also show buried optic disc drusen.

However, the future is promising for diagnosing the two conditions as a result of the use of deep learning systems.

The treatment of papilledema depends on its etiology, that is, a mass or Chiari malformation is addressed surgically, a cerebral venous thrombosis by treating the underlying cause with anticoagulants, and IIH with diet, weight loss, and pharmacologic or surgical therapy.

A new observation about papilledema arising from IIH is that the findings suggestive of IIH on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be the same as in those without IIH. Another new observation is that the prevalence rate of papilledema increased from 2.8% in patients with at least 1 sign on MRI to up to 40% when more signs of IIH were present on imaging[MK1] . Despite the findings on MRI, the only way to truly diagnosis of IIH is with lumbar puncture.

It is also important to remember that anemia can worsen papilledema from IIH. In addition to modifying diet and weight loss, the underlying anemia must also be addressed. The typical treatment of papilledema is acetazolamide (500 mg twice daily and titrated upward to 2 grams daily). Once papilledema is improving, this dosage can be decreased. Optic nerve sheath fenestration may be reserved for severe cases of vision loss.

Dr. Mileski’s clinical pearls include the following:

Papilledema is a medical emergency

Symptoms, clinical examinations, OCT, and visual fields all should be used to differentiate papilledema from pseudopapilledema

• Physicians should conduct an urgent outpatient work-up in the event of uncertainty.

• Artificial intelligence may be helpful in the future.

IIH is a diagnosis that requires needs normal MRI, magnetic resonance venography, and lumbar puncture

IIH without papilledema is possible but rare

Patients with IIH should be asked about anemia

“Clinical tools can help differentiate papilledema from pseudopapilledema. If papilledema is suspected, these patients should be sent to the emergency room for proper diagnosis and treatment. Patients need to have normal neuro-imaging (MRI, MRV) and elevated opening pressure for a diagnosis of IIH. These patients should also be tested for anemia as it can exacerbate their condition,” Dr. Mileski said.","Amblyopia: a paradigm shiftPilar Vergara, DOO, FCOVD, described a new treatment paradigm for managing anisometropic amblyopia.

Having held various leadership positions in the Army, I was comfortable speaking to large groups of people, especially when speaking about my profession in a language I understood.

At the FDA meeting, all the participants spoke English. They were also all fluent in the language of medicine, which I was not. I felt like a traveler in a foreign country who learns to say hello, goodbye, please, thank you, where’s the bathroom, and a few other useful phrases to get by while visiting.

From 1979, when I learned I had Fabry disease, until 2002, when I began learning more about it, I was the proverbial ostrich with my head in the sand. Before learning about the possibility of a new treatment in 2002, there wasn’t anything I could do. There was no remedy for the damage being caused to my body beyond managing other risk factors. I didn’t attempt to become knowledgeable about my disease even though I had many health issues.

At the FDA meeting, I listened to the panel members who would make this important decision. They expressed their concerns that the investigational treatment did not completely clear the offending lipids (primarily globotriaosylceramide, abbreviated GL3 or Gb3) that accumulate throughout our bodies, wreaking havoc on our health. The clinical trial evidence indicated complete clearance could be achieved in some cell types, but only partial clearance in other cells.

When it was my turn to speak, I said my family had already lost three family members at relatively young ages due to Fabry disease. Next, I talked about the many Fabry disease symptoms that adversely affected my quality of life. Earlier, there was a discussion about whether partial GL3 clearance was adequate in some cells or if complete GL3 clearance was essential everywhere.

I commented that people with Fabry disease are experiencing a cascade of debilitating symptoms and dying prematurely. We didn’t have time for a debate about whether this potential treatment was perfect or not.

I continued, saying that I and many others would undoubtedly be grateful for partial clearance of the accumulated lipids that were damaging our bodies while researchers continued to search for the perfect solution. My bucket list still included several long-term goals. By approving this medication, I might live long enough to fulfill them.

I will always remember feeling awkward as I spoke to the panel because I did not speak their language. Recalling the medical terms was difficult. The panel members talked about alpha-galactosidase A (the faulty enzyme that causes Fabry disease), globotriaosylceramide (the primary lipid that accumulates in our bodies), podocytes (a type of cell in the kidneys that can incur irreversible damage if not treated early), and other cell types and disease manifestations that are common in the language of Fabry disease.

At one point my mind went blank. When I commented on the lipid accumulation in my body, I could not think of the medical terms globotriaosylceramide, glycosphingolipid, glycolipid, GL3, Gb3, or even lipid, the many terms used to describe this fatty substance. I could only say that I wanted treatment to give me a chance to clear some of the damaging “gunk” from my body.

When I lived in the Netherlands and Saudi Arabia for a few years, I enrolled in college courses to learn to speak a basic level of Dutch and Arabic. When I visited Germany several times, I enrolled in adult education courses to learn a basic level of the German language.

Jerry holds a copy of the educational Fabry disease symptoms presentation he developed in 2011. (Courtesy of Jerry Walter)

Similarly, I studied and learned to speak the language of Fabry disease. I don’t have medical professional fluency, but my understanding of Fabry disease and my ability to converse about it have improved significantly over time. Having a better understanding helps me to ask my doctors the right questions, to better understand their answers, to better manage my health, and to help others to better understand and manage their disease.

To maintain the best health possible, most people will benefit from using some of the many resources available, such as live and recorded webinars, scientific articles, news articles, and written educational materials to better manage their health.

What I’ve learned about Fabry disease hasn’t waned as much over time as other foreign languages I have studied. In my work with the National Fabry Disease Foundation and in my personal life, I speak the language of Fabry disease every day.

Routine mammograms may provide information about a woman’s heart health and risk for cardiovascular disease, according to a new study of more than 5,000 women in California.

Researchers found that women who have breast arterial calcification, calcium build-up within the arteries of the breast, are at a 51% higher risk for heart disease and stroke than women who do not have breast arterial calcification.

This adds to the collective science that breast arterial calcification visible on mammograms could be useful in calculating heart disease and stroke risk in postmenopausal women, researchers said.

Embargoed until 1 p.m. CT/2 p.m. ET Tuesday, March 15, 2022

DALLAS, March 15, 2022 — Routine mammograms may provide key insights for cardiovascular disease. Detection of breast arterial calcifications on breast mammograms was associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease in postmenopausal women, according to new research published today in Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging, a peer-reviewed journal of the American Heart Association journal. This finding may be useful to help determine women’s risk for heart disease and stroke, according to the study authors.

Breast arterial calcification, calcium build-up within the middle layer of the breast’s arterial wall, is related to aging, Type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure and inflammation, and is a marker of stiffening in the arteries. It is not the same as calcification of the inner layer of the arteries (the layer that is in contact with the blood), which is typically found in people who smoke or those with high cholesterol levels. Breast arterial calcification is a common finding that shows up as white areas in the breast’s arteries on a mammogram, however, it is not thought to be related to cancer.

“In an earlier study of this same research group, we reported that among women ages 60 to 79, 26% of the women had breast arterial calcification, and the percentage increased with age to more than half of women having evidence of the finding between ages 75 to 79 years,” said the study’s lead author Carlos Iribarren, M.D., M.P.H., Ph.D., a research scientist at the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Division of Research in Oakland, California. “Research has confirmed the calculators we currently use to assess an individual’s 10-year risk of developing cardiovascular disease are not as accurate in women as they are in men. In our current study, we evaluated if breast arterial calcification, which can be easily seen on a mammogram, provides more information about a woman’s risk of developing heart disease.”

In this study, researchers reviewed health records on a subset of more than 5,000 women selected from among more than 200,000 women who underwent screening mammograms as part of MINERVA (MultIethNic study of brEast aRterial calcium gradation and cardioVAscular disease), a large, racially and ethnically diverse cohort of postmenopausal women. Participants of the current study were actively enrolled in the same health insurance plan, were between the ages of 60-79 years and received at least one regular screening with digital mammography at one of nine facilities of Kaiser Permanente of Northern California between October 24, 2012 and February 13, 2015. The women had no prior history of cardiovascular disease or breast cancer. Researchers assessed the women’s overall health and followed them through their electronic health records for about 6.5 years after the mammogram to find which women had a heart attack or stroke or developed other types of cardiovascular disease, such as heart failure.

The analysis found:

Women who had breast arterial calcification present on their mammogram were 51% more likely to develop heart disease or have a stroke compared with women who did not have breast arterial calcification.

Women with breast arterial calcification were 23% more likely to develop any type of cardiovascular disease, including heart disease, stroke, heart failure and diseases of the peripheral arteries.

Breast arterial calcification was more prevalent among women who self-identified as white or Hispanic/Latina women, and less likely among women who self-identified as Black or Asian women. Iribarren and colleagues noted more research is needed to understand these findings.

“Currently, it is not the standard of care for breast arterial calcification visible on mammograms to be reported. Some radiologists do include this information on their mammography reports, but it’s not required,” Iribarren said. “We hope that our study will encourage an update of the guidelines for reporting breast arterial calcification from routine mammograms. Our study has moved the needle toward recommending routine assessment and reporting of breast arterial calcification in postmenopausal women. Integrating this information in cardiovascular risk calculators and using this new information can help improve cardiovascular risk reduction strategies.”

Iribarren also noted that there would be no added cost or extra radiation exposure for women because the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends women ages 50-74 years have a mammogram every two years, and for women ages 40-49 years, mammography may be considered for the early diagnosis of breast cancer based on individual risks and as advised by a physician. Mammography screenings, timed according to USPSTF’s guidelines, are covered as a preventive service with no copayment by most health insurance providers including Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance companies, as required by the Affordable Care Act.

Cardiovascular disease followed by cancer are the top two causes of death among U.S. women, according to the American Heart Association’s Heart and Stroke Statistical Update 2022. However, in the U.S., more women report worrying about their risk for breast cancer than heart disease, and only half of women are even aware that heart disease is the leading cause of death in women, according to Natalie A. Cameron, M.D., and Sadiya S. Khan, M.D., M.Sc., FAHA, co-authors of an accompanying editorial for this study, also publishing today in Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging.

“This type of calcification may suggest poor heart health, and clinicians may be able to leverage this opportunity to discuss ways to optimize heart health, such as engaging in routine physical activity, high quality diet and maintaining a healthy weight,” said Khan, an assistant professor of medicine in the division of cardiology at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. “However, it is really important to note that the absence of breast arterial calcification did not translate into low risk and should not be falsely reassuring when no breast arterial calcification is present. Optimal risk factor control is equally important for all women with and without breast arterial calcification.”

Among the limitations of the study, these findings may not be generalizable to women who do not have health insurance or woman younger than age 60. Iribarren plans to incorporate women younger than age 60 in future research.

Scientists at the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) have formed the Rare Cancers Genomics Team to develop innovative research projects on rare cancers to improve the prognosis of patients diagnosed with these rare diseases. Rare cancers are cancer types with fewer than 6 newly diagnosed cases per 100 000 people per year. Rare Disease Day is marked on 28 February each year.

Taken individually, none of these cancer types are major causes of disease. However, taken as a whole, rare cancers account for about 25–30% of all cancer diagnoses and 25% of cancer deaths, representing a substantial burden of disease. Despite the high collective occurrence of rare cancers, basic science research, clinical trials, and approval of new therapies for these rare diseases are lacking. This means that patients with a rare cancer type have a worse prognosis than those with more common cancer types.

The Rare Cancers Genomics Team studies the molecular characteristics of rare cancers, to understand their etiology and carcinogenesis processes. The team does so through various approaches: by performing integrative molecular analyses of multi-omics data generated from tissue samples; by integrating big data generated from large-scale genomics initiatives; by using image-based deep learning to review and identify new morphological characteristics; and, with external partners, by using state-of-the-art in vitro organoid models to study cancer initiation and progression.

Although tens of thousands of patients worldwide may be living with a particular rare cancer type, the geographical dispersion of the patients often limits the number of cases seen at any one institution. This makes recruitment for clinical trials extremely challenging and stalls efforts to test emerging therapeutics. Therefore, providing new approaches to study rare cancers that help to overcome the intrinsic limitation of low numbers is key to improve the clinical management of patients.

With a view to addressing these challenges, increasing the pool of data, and facilitating access to it, the Rare Cancers Genomics Team is strongly committed to open science. The team makes available all the resources needed to reproduce the analyses, including raw and processed data, interactive computational notebooks, user-friendly tumour maps that anyone can explore in a web browser, and bioinformatics pipelines.

The current cancers of interest and studies led by the Rare Cancer Genomics Team are the following: neuroendocrine neoplasms (lungNENomics and panNENomics); malignant pleural mesothelioma (MESOMICS); and soft tissue sarcomas and carcinosarcomas (SARCOMICS).

659,659,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/health-matters/controlling-cancer-chronic-disease-2488591,Controlling Cancer like a Chronic Disease,"Singapore, like most modern, developed countries, has been battling an increasing incidence of cancer. While numbers remain high, the cancer survival rate in Singapore has correspondingly increased.

When the Singapore Cancer Registry (SCR) began tracking population-based cancer trends in 1968, the cancer survival rate was some 18 per cent. Today, the cancer survival rate has grown to almost 60 per cent.

“The advancements in cancer treatment over the last few decades have been remarkable. Some patients with metastatic disease, where cancer has spread to other parts of the body, survive for more than five years, sometimes even up to 10 years”, says Dr Wong Chiung Ing. “That’s something we would not have expected when I started as a doctor more than 20 years ago.”

Medical oncologist Dr Wong states that the new weapons available in the fight against cancer, such as targeted therapy and immunotherapy, are primary reasons for the increase in survival rates.

Targeted Therapy and Antibody-Drug Conjugates

The Singapore cancer data base also found that the 5-year survival period was higher for women, even in the later age group, where breast and lung cancer are the most common.

In treating breast cancer these days, Dr Wong says the focus is on the use of medication to inhibit receptors that play a role in cancer cell growth.

In 70 to 80 per cent of all breast cancers, the hormone receptors estrogen and progesterone are present.

“Once we can accurately identify that the breast cancer is hormone receptor positive, treatment will be focused in using medication to stop estrogen and progesterone hormones from acting on cancer cells, causing it to stop growing and eventually die off.”

The specialist in breast and gynaecological cancers at Parkway Cancer Centre adds that “since these receptors are found mainly in breast cancer cells, such targeted therapy will spare normal cells from the side effects of treatment.”","While numbers remain high, the cancer survival rate in Singapore has correspondingly increased.

661,661,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/the-end-of-inflammation-new-approach-could-treat-dozens-of-diseases,The end of inflammation? New approach could treat dozens of diseases.,"Growing up in Atlanta, Georgia, Lauren Finney Harden had always had allergies. But after she moved to New York City for her first job in 2007, inflammation “just exploded” throughout her body.

“I had insane full-body rashes and strange gastro issues. I’d get massive burps that made me feel like I needed to throw up, but nothing would come up but air,” she says. Eventually, she was diagnosed with lupus, a disease in which the immune system attacks the body’s own tissues and organs. She was put on a drug called prednisone, a corticosteroid that tamps down inflammation.

But the cure, at times, felt worse than the disease. “I looked four months pregnant all the time,” Finney Harden says, “and I’d get cold sores every other week; my body could not fight off anything.”

Finney Harden’s experience is unfortunately a common one with traditional autoimmune treatments like prednisone. A broad immunosuppressant, prednisone works by disabling the production of pro-inflammatory molecules that are crucial for the body to mount an immune defense. So while prednisone—and drugs like it—are adept at quickly snuffing out inflammation, they leave the body vulnerable to any bug it encounters, and they can come with toxic side effects.

“Simply stopping inflammation is not enough to return tissue to its normal state,” says Ruslan Medzhitov, a professor of immunobiology at Yale School of Medicine. This approach ignores the other side of the inflammation coin: resolution. Resolving inflammation is an active, highly choreographed process for rebuilding tissue and removing the dead bacteria and cells. When that process is disrupted, inflammatory diseases arise.

In the early 2000s researchers began to recognize the role of inflammation in conditions as varied as Alzheimer’s, cancer, diabetes, and heart disease, prompting them to recast inflammation as the unifying explanation for a myriad of ailments, including those we develop as we age. Even aging itself, and its associated pathologies, is driven by persistent inflammation.

“Until relatively recently, we believed that inflammation just stopped,” says Molly Gilligan, an internal medicine resident at Columbia University who studies how the immune system impacts cancer development. Immunologists thought that products of inflammation—molecules that trigger it and dead cells and tissue—are eventually metabolized, or spontaneously dissipate on their own.

The reality is more complicated, and recognizing that could have game-changing effects on how we treat a wide swath of diseases.

Why is inflammation dangerous?

Inflammation evolved to serve an important function: It rids our bodies of stuff that doesn’t belong, including foreign invaders like bacteria and viruses, tumor cells, and irritants like splinters.

“A classic example of inflammatory onset is the bee sting—the site becomes hot, red, swollen, and painful,” says Derek Gilroy, a professor of immunology at University College London. This response comes from a series of biological changes: blood vessels dilate to deliver white blood cells to the site of injury, making tissues turn red. Fluid also floods the site, causing swelling. The molecules that trigger these vascular transformations precipitate the itching, pain, and fever associated with inflammation.

White blood cells, the body’s first responders, then swarm and kill the invaders. Under normal circumstances, this carnage is contained, with the initial inflammatory response subsiding within 24 to 48 hours.

When inflammation becomes chronic, though, the chemical weapons deployed by front-line immune cells often damage healthy tissue, and our bodies become collateral damage. The price exacted includes worn joints, damaged neurons, scarred kidneys, and more. Autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, characterized by pain and worsening disability, have long been associated with persistent inflammation.

In extreme cases, such as the cytokine storms associated with sepsis or severe COVID-19, inflammation can destroy and disable multiple organs, leading to catastrophic system failure and death.

What happens after inflammation?

Medzhitov likens an infection to a broken pipe that has flooded an office with water. Fixing the pipe might stop water from streaming in, but it doesn’t restore the office to its previous, functional state. Similarly, inflammation has a clean-up phase known as resolution, and it proceeds in a series of highly coordinated steps.

Like inflammation’s onset, its resolution is orchestrated by an army of signaling molecules. Among the most intensely studied are the specialized pro-resolving mediators, or SPMs, which were discovered in the 1990s by Charles Serhan, a professor of anesthesia at Harvard Medical School. Serhan was inspired by his postdoctoral mentor, Bengt Samuelsson, who uncovered how fatty molecules called lipids trigger inflammation. Serhan was searching for similar molecules when he identified lipoxin. But to his surprise, rather than inciting inflammation, lipoxin seemed to hamper it.

Over the next several years, Serhan and his colleagues identified additional SPMs. These molecules are derived from essential fatty acids such as those omega-3s famously found in cold-water fish like salmon and sardines. But they are difficult to study in the lab. “One of the main challenges is that they have short half-lives, so the body metabolizes them very quickly,” Gilligan says. Because of this, researchers who work on them often turn to synthetic versions of the molecules, or mimetics, which are simpler, more stable, and cheaper to produce.

Catherine Godson, a professor of molecular medicine at University College Dublin, has long been interested in diabetes, given its impact on global public health as the most common cause of kidney failure. When she learned of SPMs, she was excited by the idea of encouraging resolution to treat diabetics, a “population with a particularly high risk for infection.”

In mice with diabetic kidney disease, scarring from kidney inflammation gradually destroys the organ. Her team is testing the therapeutic potential of a lipoxin mimetic in these and other animal models. They’ve also looked at the mimetic’s effect in human tissue in lab cell cultures taken from patients with atherosclerosis, an inflammatory disease of the blood vessel wall. In both cases, inflammatory factors plummeted when the mimetic was introduced; for the mice, the kidneys recovered their function in a stunning reversal of established disease.

Gilroy notes, however, that the story on SPMs is incomplete. “While lipoxins are present at levels in the body that indicate that they’re important in resolution, other SPMs such as resolvins require more evaluation,” he says.

Manipulating macrophages

Scientists speculate that one way lipoxins and other pro-resolution molecules work is by interacting with immune cells called macrophages.

Because they’re so abundant during inflammation, macrophages have traditionally been thought of as pro-inflammatory cells, says Gerhard Krönke, an immunologist and rheumatologist at the University of Erlangen-Nürnberg. “But a paradigm shift in the last decade or so suggests that macrophages are pivotal players in the resolution of inflammation.”

Gilroy agrees, calling macrophages “linchpin cells at the juxtaposition of inflammation and resolution: It can go one way if we’re healthy and the other way if we’re not.”

Initially, when the danger posed by invaders is at its peak, the macrophages drawn to the area are inflammatory—secreting pro-inflammatory cytokines and amping up production of antimicrobial agents. But this balance shifts as the tide of the confrontation turns. After the number of viruses declines, the debris left behind—viral remnants, dead immune cells, and other waste—must be collected and cleared away before it sparks another cycle of inflammation. That’s when the macrophages switch gears.

Attracted by “eat me” signals expressed on the surface of dying cells, macrophages readily engulf and clear cellular corpses from the environment. But it’s not just about clearing the wreckage—this act also flips a genetic switch, reprogramming macrophages to restore balance to the system and heal the tissues.

“Macrophages start to produce factors that tell the local tissue, Don’t recruit any more inflammatory cells here, or, Let’s proliferate and start repairs there,” says Kodi Ravichandran, an immunologist at Washington University in St. Louis whose research focuses on how dead cells are cleared from the body.

Clearing away cellular debris

Now consensus is building that many of the illnesses attributed to inflammation—both chronic and acute—can be traced to a failure in resolution. Often that translates into a failure to clear away dead cells.

“If you knock out receptors in the macrophages of mice that recognize dying cells, for example, they become incapable of eating up these cells, resulting in a lupus-like disease,” with symptoms such as arthritis and skin rash, says Krönke.

A similar mechanism is at work in older people, says Gilroy. As we age, the body loses a protein that recognizes dying cells; this blocks macrophages’ ability to find and eat debris. Locked in a pro-inflammatory state, these macrophages continue to produce molecules that amplify the inflammatory response early on.

Perhaps COVID-19 has been more severe in older populations “because they’ve lost some of the pro-resolution pathways with age,” suggests Luke O’Neill, an immunologist at Trinity College Dublin. He notes that COVID-19 has also been problematic for people with genetic differences that impact immune function, resulting in overactive inflammatory responses or underactive pro-resolving ones. His group and others have demonstrated that macrophages primed for inflammatory action play a significant role in critical COVID-19 cases, and they are currently testing pro-resolving strategies to combat this effect.

Cancer’s course, too, is affected when inflammation fails to resolve. The soup of toxins, growth factors, and other inflammatory by-products that accompany inflammation spurs cancer’s growth and spread. Many conventional treatments end up exacerbating the problem, according to Dipak Panigrahy, an assistant professor of pathology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.

“Chemotherapy and radiation are like sledgehammers,” Panigrahy says. “They may kill the tumor, but the debris they create stimulates inflammation, which feeds circulating tumor cells that survive the treatment.”

A decade ago, Panigrahy was puzzling over this conundrum when he met Serhan at a conference on lipids in Cancún, Mexico. “I had just presented my research on cell death in cancer and how there’s no way to clear the resulting debris when I heard Serhan’s talk about how he discovered these lipids that eliminated debris,” he says. The two Boston-based researchers have shared a close collaboration ever since.

In proof-of-concept experiments conducted on mice, Panigrahy’s group was able to prevent tumors from recurring after surgery by dosing the animals with mimetics of resolvin, one of the pro-resolving mediators discovered in Serhan’s lab. Phase one clinical trials for pancreatic, brain, and colon cancers will begin this year, says Panigrahy.

Long COVID and inflammation

Although much work remains to decode its secrets, “long COVID likely results from a catastrophic failure of appropriate immune response and resolution,” Gilroy suggests.

Meg St. Esprit is part of a large cohort of COVID-19 survivors who continue to suffer symptoms months after the virus has passed. She and her family contracted the disease in November 2020, and for seven days the mother of four in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, was beset by a high fever and severe headaches. Debilitating fatigue, vertigo, and brain fog soon followed. But while her husband and children recovered, St. Esprit’s symptoms lingered, and new ones emerged.

Since her bout with COVID-19, she has developed blood clots and myocarditis—dangerous consequences of inflammation. It’s also as if her entire body has gone haywire. “Different parts of it regularly flare up now,” she says. “My thumb joints swell to twice their normal size, my knee puffs out like a grapefruit, and I’","This approach ignores the other side of the inflammation coin: resolution.

Entire videos can be convincingly fabricated to show a world leader saying and doing things that didn’t happen in real life. Armies of bots can drive conversations on social media, repeating false information over and over again until it almost feels like fact. And videos and images of old events pop up with alarming regularity, recaptioned to make it seem as if they are part of current events.

In normal times, this would be cause enough for alarm. But in the past two years we have lived through a pandemic – and with it, a fake news ""infodemic"" – and now, with the Russian invasion, a war in Ukraine. More than ever, we need to be able to trust what we are seeing. ""Falsehood flies, and the truth comes limping after it"" – and that subsequent truth is rarely as well shared as the initial attention grabbing misinformation.

Whether it is footage of the Ghost of Kyiv – later discovered to be a video game – or photographs claiming to show Nazi activity, there are some tools and resources you can use to weed out the false information before you unwittingly become part of the misinformation machine.

Images

Manipulated images are everywhere. Whether it is carefully retouched advertising images or filtered Instagram pictures, we have learned not to trust everything in front of our eyes.

However, some fakes are more blatant than others. One tool you can use is an image’s metadata, also known as EXIF data. This is information embedded in the image file that tells you what device the photo was taken with, the date it was created, exposure values, white balance, the lens used and so on.

If an image claims to be of an event that took place in 2022, but the EXIF data shows it was taken several years previously, the story is effectively debunked.

On smartphones, there are several apps that will help you read the metadata of photos sent to you, including ExifWizard. On desktop, you can use Jeffrey's Image Metadata Viewer to see some of the hidden information.

However, some platforms strip the metadata out of the image, giving you very little to go on. In that case, you can do a reverse image search to see if the image has appeared anywhere else. That can give you a decent clue about whether the image is genuine or has been faked.

It can also reveal images that have been taken out of context. For example, in the first few days after Russia invaded Ukraine, footage claiming to show troops facing off against each other emerged; while the photos were of genuine troops, they were from 2014. A quick reverse image search, either through Google Image search or TinEye, would reveal previous uses of the image – and any accompanying information that could date them.

There are limitations to the technology, however. If an image is flipped, for example, into a mirror image of the original, it may not be picked up by the image search.

Amnesty International has also got in on the misinformation fight, with a tool that helps verify videos on YouTube. YouTube Dataviewer takes the URL of the video you are trying to verify, and pulls out important information such as the time and date of its upload to YouTube, which can help you track down the original upload, and thumbnail images that can be reverse-searched to find anywhere else the images have been used.

Myth busting and fact-checking sites

If something seems too good to be true, it usually is. But what if the news being shared is the opposite? That’s when you can turn to the numerous fact-checking websites out there, taking down one hoax at a time. Don't rely on one source for your information though, as sites can sometimes get it wrong too.

When it comes to hoaxes, urban legends and misinformation, Snopes is usually the first port of call to check fact from fiction. In the past week or so, the site has dealt with a number of claims about the Ukraine invasion, including a climate protest miscaptioned both as genuine war footage from Ukraine and crisis actors; debunked Ebay listings selling Russian tanks captured by Ukranians; and cats trained to spot sniper lasers.

Sources are listed for each fact-check, and the site is open about its fact-checking procedure, and who is behind the entire operation.

It is a similar procedure over at FactCheck.org, a project of the Annenberg Public Policy Center in the US. The website details its funding and its objectives, and its link to Facebook, where it debunks misinformation.

Social media

According to figures from Statista, about 51 per cent of Irish adults regularly use social media as a news source. But trust in the platforms isn’t exactly high, and given recent events that isn’t all that surprising.

Twitter has introduced a number of tools to help stop the spread of misinformation on the platform. If you retweet a link, Twitter prompts you to read the article first. In the past it has also labelled tweets containing misinformation, rather than removing them completely, and redirected users to more trustworthy sources of information. Facebook also applies similar labels on articles that have been run through fact-checkers.

However, it is not a fool-proof system so it is worth double-checking where the information is coming from before you share.

Check the profile carefully, starting with the user name. There are clever tricks to make a username seem like a well-known person, such as using a capital “I” in place of a lowercase “l”. Twitter verification doesn’ mean the account is trustworthy in its views, but that blue tick can instil a certain level of trust in people.

If an account has no profile picture or an image that is definitely not theirs, it may not be a genuine account. That’s not a given; plenty of people don’t bother putting their own face to an account for a number of reasons, not all nefarious.

Does it have any contact details in the bio? Is the bio misspelled, or missing altogether? Have they recently joined the platform? Some social media platforms let you see when an account was activated. A new account could have been created solely to spread disinformation about a particular event.

Follower count is no indication of the legitimacy of the account – followers are easy to manufacture or buy, so don’t trust someone just because they have thousands of followers.

What kind of posts are they making? If the account is repeating the same posts over and over, it may not be a genuine account. The same goes for repeated use of hashtags or replies to people that seem out of context.

Not sure if that Twitter account is genuine? Check with Bot Sentinel. The Osome project rates accounts on their activity and how likely it is that they are inauthentic.

There is another thing to take into account: not all bots are bad. In fact, some exist to spread real information, either through automated tweeting of legitimate news sources, or scraping data from official sources and tweeting it out to the world.

This is where our innate sense of judgment has to take over.","In that case, you can do a reverse image search to see if the image has appeared anywhere else.
A quick reverse image search, either through Google Image search or TinEye, would reveal previous uses of the image – and any accompanying information that could date them.
If an image is flipped, for example, into a mirror image of the original, it may not be picked up by the image search.

663,663,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/muscle-strengthening-exercises-may-lower-risk-of-death,"Muscle strengthening may lower cancer, diabetes, heart disease risk","Share on Pinterest Can weight-strengthening exercises reduce mortality risk? Cavan Images/Getty Images The authors of a new meta-analysis of prior studies wanted to determine how much time adults should spend doing muscle-strengthening exercises each week.

They conclude that doing 30–60 minutes of these exercises each week lowers the risk of all-cause death, cardiovascular disease, and cancer.

They also report that up to 1 hour of muscle-strengthening exercises a week reduces the risk of developing diabetes.

However, limitations in the data mean that more research is necessary to clarify the results. Although the health benefits of aerobic exercise are well-established, there has been less research into the health benefits of muscle-strengthening exercises. Recently, a group of researchers from Japan set out to investigate. The study, which appears in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, took data from existing studies to learn more about how these exercises affect health. The findings showed that adults who do 30–60 minutes of muscle-strengthening exercises each week have a 10–20% reduction in mortality risk, alongside a reduced risk of other health conditions.

Exercise recommendations Being physically active is important for maintaining good physical and mental health. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) recommends that adults participate in 150–300 minutes of moderate intensity or 75–150 minutes of vigorous intensity aerobic physical activity each week to ensure “substantial health benefits.” Aerobic exercises improve heart health . Some examples include swimming, cycling, walking, and rowing. Additionally, the HHS recommends that adults do muscle-strengthening exercises on 2 days of each week. Some types of exercises that strengthen the muscles include weightlifting, using resistance bands, and doing bodyweight exercises, such as pushups, situps, and squats. The HHS notes that “nearly 80% of adults are not meeting the key guidelines for both aerobic and muscle-strengthening activity.”

Muscle-strengthening exercise study The goal of this study was to use previously published research to determine how much time adults should spend per week doing muscle-strengthening exercises to improve overall health. The researchers used data from 16 relevant observational studies published between 2012 and 2020 to determine the health benefits of these exercises. They focused on studies with participants who did not have any major health issues. Each study that the authors reviewed had data from thousands of participants, and one of the studies included data from almost 480,000 people. The included studies followed the participants for a minimum of 2 years. According to the authors, “All studies focused on muscle-strengthening exercises such as resistance/strength/weight training and calisthenics, but not on muscle-strengthening activities such as carrying heavy loads and heavy gardening.” After analyzing the data, the authors determined that muscle-strengthening activities were associated with a 10–17% lower risk of all-cause mortality. There was also a similar risk reduction for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, total cancer, and lung cancer. While there were reductions in overall cancer and lung cancer cases, the researchers did not find a risk reduction for other cancers, such as colon, kidney, bladder, and pancreatic cancer. Dr. Anton Bilchik spoke with Medical News Today about the study findings. Dr. Bilchik is a surgical oncologist, professor of surgery, chief of medicine, and director of the gastrointestinal research program at Saint John’s Cancer Institute in Santa Monica, CA. “This study is important because it is a meta-analysis of 16 prospective cohort studies that demonstrates that muscle-strengthening activity reduces the risk of developing cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes,” said Dr. Bilchik. “The maximum risk reduction was 10–20% if 60 minutes [each] week of muscle-strengthening was performed. There was, however, no association with specific cancers, such as colon, kidney, bladder, and pancreas.” Dr. Bilchik also explained why muscle-strengthening exercises can be so beneficial: “The authors suggest that muscle strengthening is associated with preservation of skeletal muscle mass, which then plays an important role in glucose metabolism. Abnormal glucose metabolism has been associated with an increase in cardiovascular disease and cancer.” Although the authors found that doing 30–60 minutes of muscle-strengthening exercises each week provided health benefits, they did not find evidence that going beyond 60 minutes provided additional benefits.","They conclude that doing 30–60 minutes of these exercises each week lowers the risk of all-cause death, cardiovascular disease, and cancer.

In a statement, House Ways and Means Chair Joey Sarte Salceda said Senate Bill No. 1869, the Senate version of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) bill, got a push from Marcos as the latter's certification would allow the Senate to discuss it in plenary and approve it on third reading on the same day.

The measure is the Senate version of House Bill No. 6096 filed by Salceda in January 2020. He refiled it as House Bill No. 46 during the 19th Congress.

Salceda thanked Marcos, saying the measure is vital to protecting Filipinos from pandemics.

""Pandemics are now cyclical and our preparedness must be permanent,"" he said in a statement.

""My initial version contained several health emergency provisions that were written in anticipation of necessary lockdowns, quarantines, and continued disease surveillance. Of course, legislation is compromised so that bill evolved through the different stages, and is more institutional than a matter of broader health emergency powers,"" he added.

The CDC, he said, would be ""much better"" than the ""very ad-hoc nature of the RITM (Research Institute for Tropical Medicine).""

""It got stuck last time due to some fundamental disagreements on the structure of the institution.

One morning in December 2020, feeling aggrieved that his father had falsely accused him of throwing away a scoop used for laundry detergent, the boy stabbed the 49-year-old in the neck at their Loyang condominium.

On Monday (Jan 24), the lanky, bespectacled boy, who turns 16 next month, pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder in the High Court. He had been initially charged with murder.

He was sentenced to five years' detention - the first person here to be sentenced under a provision in the Children and Young Persons Act that allows the court to impose detention for murder, culpable homicide, attempted murder or causing grievous hurt.

Prosecutors had sought five to seven years' detention, while the defence asked for three to five years.

The boy, who has been remanded at the Singapore Boys' Home since his arrest, will likely continue to be detained there as he studies for his O levels this year.

Should he go on to take his A levels or N levels, he will be transferred to prison, which offers the necessary academic support, Deputy Public Prosecutor Lim Shin Hui told the court.

In sentencing, Justice Aedit Abdullah said three years was too short a time to enable sufficient rehabilitation, although he accepted psychiatric assessment that the boy was not likely to repeat such a violent act.

On the other hand, seven years was too long, he said, given that it remained uncertain whether the boy could be granted early release.

The judge also suggested that the authorities look into some form of pre-sentencing assessment for such detentions, involving psychiatrists, developmental psychologists, detention officers and other specialists.

He told the boy: “I hope you will reflect on what has happened and what you can do better.”

The boy, his parents and his younger brother cannot be named, under the Act.

The court heard that the boy was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) when he was one year and eight months old.

He initially enrolled in Pathlight School for Primary 1 but transferred to a mainstream school shortly after as he was deemed to be sufficiently high-functioning.

In 2018, when he was 12, he was diagnosed with Internet gaming disorder and attended various counselling and therapy programmes to manage both disorders.

The court heard that he had a difficult relationship with his father, whom he saw as being ""highly controlling"" for limiting his access to his mobile phone and computer games.

His father monitored the boy closely and set regular tasks and assignments for him, including laundry duties, homework and assessment books.

""When the accused occasionally failed to comply with the deceased's instructions, the deceased would hit the accused and swear at him,"" said the DPP.","SINGAPORE - For months, a 14-year-old boy who had an Internet gaming addiction harboured thoughts of killing his father for restricting his access to computer games.

“We will simplify our safe management measures so that they are easier for businesses and people, individuals to understand and comply with,"" said co-chair of the multi-ministry task force Gan Kim Yong on Wednesday (Feb 16).

""This will also encourage a greater sense of personal responsibility, which will play an increasingly important part in our journey towards COVID resilience.""

While Singapore is in the midst of an Omicron wave, its high vaccination and booster jab rates, along with safe management measures, have kept the number of severe cases low, said the Ministry of Health (MOH).

Singapore can further ease measures when the number of cases starts to come down, Mr Gan added.

But for now, here's what you need to know about the key changes to safe management measures.

1. Safe distancing will no longer be a requirement if masks are worn

From Feb 25, safe distancing is encouraged but will not be required between individuals or groups of people while wearing masks.

It will still be mandatory in settings where masks are not worn, such as when dining in at F&B outlets. The required distance will be fixed at 1m for all settings.

With the new rules, practices that “actually do not make a material difference” to the pandemic are no longer forbidden, said Health Minister Ong Ye Kung.

“For example, so long as people are wearing masks, there is no need to cross out alternate seats in park benches, or the urinals in a men’s toilet. Or when people wear their masks and they stand together and take a photo, they don’t have to be a metre apart,” he added.

“I think all these little things don’t matter, really don’t matter anymore, we can do away with them. Our people know that we are in a crisis and we can start to remove these little daily reminders that are not really material anymore.”

2. Group size for social gatherings remains at five, but households can have five visitors at any one time

The group size for social gatherings remains capped at five people.

But from Feb 25, the maximum number of unique visitors per household will be adjusted from five people per day to five people at any one time.

When the Omicron wave is over, Singapore can consider “bolder moves” like adjusting the permitted group size to eight, 10 or even more people, said Mr Gan.

From Feb 25, unvaccinated children aged 12 and below do not need to be from the same household to be included in a group entering a place or taking part in activities with vaccination-differentiated measures.","SINGAPORE: Singapore has adjusted its COVID-19 measures as the country continues its transition to living with the coronavirus.

What's more, the nation's top politicians and political parties are more unpopular than popular, and interest in the upcoming November midterms is down — not up.

And when Americans were asked to describe where they believe America is today, the top answers were ""downhill,"" ""divisive,"" ""negative,"" ""struggling,"" ""lost"" and ""bad.""

Those are the grim findings of a new national NBC News poll conducted less than 10 months before the midterm elections, when control of the U.S. Senate, U.S. House and governors' mansions across the country will be up for grabs.

""Downhill, divided, doubting democracy, falling behind, and tuning out — this is how Americans are feeling as they're heading into 2022,"" said Democratic pollster Jeff Horwitt of Hart Research Associates, who conducted this survey with Republican pollster Bill McInturff of Public Opinion Strategies.

That pessimism and gloom isn't helping the party in control of the White House and Congress.

While the poll shows Democrats enjoying a narrow 1 point advantage over Republicans as the party that should control Congress, it also shows President Joe Biden's job approval rating remaining in the low 40s, Republicans holding a double-digit edge in enthusiasm and key Democratic groups losing interest in the upcoming election.

""There is nothing but flashing red flights and warning signs for Democrats,"" said McInturff, the Republican pollster.

'Bad news for the party in power'

According to the poll, 72 percent of Americans say the country is headed in the wrong direction — essentially unchanged from the 71 percent who held this view in October's NBC News poll.

It marks just the sixth time in the poll's history when 70 percent or more have said the nation is on the wrong track in back-to-back surveys.

""In the three instances when this sustained dark outlook coincided with an election year, it foreshadowed bad news for the party in power — 1992, 2008 and 2016,"" said Horwitt, the Democratic pollster.

On the economy, while job creation is up and the unemployment rate is down, 61 percent of respondents in the poll say their family's income is falling behind the cost of living.

That's compared with 30 percent who say they're staying about even and 7 percent who say their income is going up faster than the cost of living.

On the state of the nation's politics, 70 percent agree with the statement that America has become so polarized that it can no longer solve the major issues facing the country — and that those differences will only continue to grow.

By contrast, 27 percent agree with the statement that, despite the nation's strong partisan differences, the country always comes together to solve the greatest challenges.

That's a significant shift from when this question was last asked in 2010 — when 50 percent answered that America always comes together in tough times, versus 45 percent who said that the nation's political differences would only grow.

And on the state of democracy, a whopping 76 percent of Americans — including 7 in 10 Democrats, Republicans and independents — believe there is a threat to democracy and majority rule in this country.

A look ahead to the midterms

With fewer than 300 days until the November midterm elections, the NBC News poll finds 47 percent of registered voters saying they prefer a Democratic-controlled Congress, while 46 percent want Republicans in charge.

That's essentially unchanged from October, when Democrats held a 2 point edge on this question, 47 percent to 45 percent.

But Republicans enjoy a double-digit advance on enthusiasm ahead of November's elections, with 61 percent of Republicans saying they are very interested in the upcoming midterms — registering their interest either as a 9 or 10 on a 10-point scale — compared with 47 percent of Democrats who say the same.

In previous midterm cycles — whether 2006, 2010, 2014 or 2018 — the party that held a double-digit advantage in enthusiasm ended up making substantial gains.

Additionally, overall enthusiasm for the upcoming midterms is down from 59 percent who indicated a high level of interest in October, to 51 percent in this most recent poll.

And some of the biggest drops have come from key segments of the Democratic base, including Black voters, young voters and urban voters.

The top issues facing the country

Asked their two most important issues facing the country, the top responses from Americans were jobs and the economy (a combined 42 percent), the coronavirus (29 percent), voting rights and election integrity (25 percent), the cost of living (23 percent) and border security and immigration (22 percent).

Among Democrats, the top issues were the coronavirus, voting rights and election integrity, social and racial justice, jobs/economy and climate change.

Among Republicans, the top issues were jobs/economy, border security/immigration, taxes and spending and the cost of living.

Unpopular politicians and parties

Finally, the NBC News poll finds every politician and political party it tested to be more unpopular than popular with the American public:

Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo.: 23 percent positive, 29 percent negative (-6)

President Joe Biden: 39 percent positive, 48 percent negative (-9)

The Republican Party: 34 percent positive, 44 percent negative (-10)

Donald Trump: 37 percent positive, 51 percent negative (-14)

The Democratic Party: 33 percent positive, 48 percent negative (-15)

Vice President Kamala Harris: 32 percent positive, 49 percent negative (-17)

The NBC News poll was conducted Jan. 14-18 of 1,000 adults — including 650 respondents who only have a cellphone — and the overall margin of error is plus-minus 3.1 percentage points.

The margin of error for the poll's 790 registered voters is plus-minus 3.5 percentage points.","And when Americans were asked to describe where they believe America is today, the top answers were ""downhill,"" ""divisive,"" ""negative,"" ""struggling,"" ""lost"" and ""bad.""

Rising cases of chronic kidney disease take a toll not only on patients but also on the healthcare system hence, there is a clear need to address this challenge by promoting CKD screening, so it can be identified at an early stage enabling earlier treatment and management, which may slow or regress the progression of the condition.

In India, CKD is an especially pressing problem as it is commonly observed in people with diabetes – with studies suggesting almost one in two people with diabetes, suffering with CKD. We have a large population of people in India living with diabetes at an estimated 77 million adults and according to health experts, this forms a risk factor, along with hypertension, heart diseases, obesity, family history of CKD, older age, smoking and more thus, it becomes important for people across the country – particularly those at high-risk – to get screened for the disease.

In an interview with HT Lifestyle, Dr Ambrish Mithal, Chairman, Endocrinology and Diabetes at Max Super Specialty Hospital in Saket and Max Hospital in Gurgaon, revealed, “Unfortunately, CKD is underdiagnosed. Clinicians were found to be more successful in recognizing the disease in its advanced stages – but even then, nearly half of the patients in a late stage of the disease were missed, according to a study. Broadly, kidney function testing coverage is low. This is for a number of reasons, with a prominent one being a lack of understanding and knowledge of CKD, amongst those affected, and at times, even amongst primary care healthcare practitioners. Typically results for tests such as urine albumin or creatinine or eGFR take time to come, and this may cause an impediment for patients, particularly those who are travelling for care. These particularly pose a problem for people in rural areas affected by the condition. It is important to bridge such gaps using newer technologies.”

Sharing that early detection of CKD supported by screening remains an important economically viable option to reduce the strain of kidney failure on healthcare infrastructure, he suggested, “Widescale testing is vital as early CKD can be asymptomatic. In at-risk individuals, early detection can also help people better manage their health. International guidelines recommend screening at least annually for kidney dysfunction in patients with diabetes.”

According to him, two important markers to detect kidney disease are urine Albumin-Creatinine Ratio (uACR) and estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR). Dr Ambrish Mithal said, “In India, testing varies in different clinics and hospitals, and there can be challenges with the uptake of testing, including economic factors and the rural-urban divide. Studies suggest >50% of CKD patients get diagnosed very late in India leading to higher treatment & management costs for the patients.vi It is clear that the country can benefit from more accessible tests, such as point-of-care tests, which prove a useful option. Point-of-care fully quantitative uACR test may take around 5 minutes to show result and can be an option in the physician’s clinic to screen patients with risk factors such as diabetes or hypertension.”

While the adoption of these is at a nascent stage in India, its advantages are clear. Dr Ambrish Mithal gushed, “It can minimise the burden on patients and healthcare delivery centres and support detection and sustained medical care more smoothly. Such tests can offer reliable results conveniently and swiftly that too near patient or in physician’s office, which can be used as a screening tool for risk stratification and early-stage screening as well. These tests, done regularly, can also support doctors in selecting and adjusting treatment as part of the patient’s long-term disease management, enabling a degree of personalisation. Beyond encouraging testing, there are also other important areas to address. One is helping build a clearer understanding of the disease through knowledge-sharing workshops or programs with general physicians, not just specialists. This can be started at earlier stages, such as during medical training at educational facilities. This is an important consideration given the gap between the number of specialist doctors and people with chronic kidney disease in the country. Raising awareness of the benefits of tests, such as for kidney function, amongst patients is also important, to support consistent and regular testing and adherence to treatment plans.”

By advancing information and scalable screening options, we can move towards reducing India’s burden of chronic kidney disease.","Chronic Kidney Disease in India: Two important markers to detect kidney disease (Getty Images/iStockphoto)In India, CKD is an especially pressing problem as it is commonly observed in people with diabetes – with studies suggesting almost one in two people with diabetes, suffering with CKD.

After that, however, a heatwave at the end of July, led to a considerable loss of ice.

In terms of “total mass balance” (the sum of surface melting and loss of ice chunks from icebergs, in addition to the melting of glacier “tongues” in contact with seawater), the ice sheet lost around 166 billion tonnes during the 12-month period ending in August 2021.

Polar Portal The difference between the annual suface mass balance for the periods 2010-2021 and 1981-2010 (expressed as mm ice melt).

Climate change

These numbers mean the ice sheet ended the season with a net surface mass balance of approximately 396 billion tonnes, making it the 28th lowest level recorded, in the 41-year time series.

This could be considered an average year, but Polar Report notes how perspectives have changed, due to rapidly advancing climate change.

At the end of the 1990s, for example, these same figures would have been regarded as a year with a very low surface mass balance.

The report also notes that the cause of the early summer chill, could be due to conditions over southwest Canada and the northwest United States.

In these territories, an enormous “blocking"" high pressure system was formed, shaped like the Greek capital letter Omega (Ω).

Polar Portal The map shows cool, moist summer weather over Greenland (in the middle of the map) and the extreme heat over North America.

This flow pattern occurs regularly in the troposphere, and not just over North America, but it had never been observed with such strength before.

According to the report, an analysis by World Weather Attribution demonstrated that it could only be explained as a result of atmospheric warming caused by human activity.

Notable year

According to the report, 2021 was notable for several reasons.

It was the year in which precipitation at Summit Station, which is located at the top of the ice sheet at an altitude of 3,200 metres above sea level, was registered in the form of rain.

The year also saw an acceleration of the loss of ice at the Sermeq Kujalleq glacier, where the rate of loss had otherwise been stagnant for several years.

Winter snowfall was also close to average for the period between 1981 and 2010, which was good news, because a combination of low winter snowfall and a warm summer can result in very large losses of ice, as was the case in 2019.","After that, however, a heatwave at the end of July, led to a considerable loss of ice.

Complications of Chronic Kidney Disease

As CKD progresses and the kidneys start to fail, other organ systems can become affected and require medical treatment.

The seven most common complications of CKD include:

High blood pressure : In the same way that high blood pressure can cause CKD, CKD can cause high blood pressure by making it harder for the heart to pump blood to the major arteries of the kidneys.

: In the same way that high blood pressure can cause CKD, CKD can cause high blood pressure by making it harder for the heart to pump blood to the major arteries of the kidneys. Coronary artery disease : In tandem with hypertension, CKD can give rise to atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) and coronary artery disease (CAD), both of which contribute to an increased risk of heart attacks and heart failure.

Mineral and bone disease : The inability to maintain the normal balance of calcium and phosphorus can cause numerous health problems, including bone pain, brittle bones, heart and nerve dysfunction, blocked blood vessels, and delayed growth in children.

: The inability to maintain the normal balance of calcium and phosphorus can cause numerous health problems, including bone pain, brittle bones, heart and nerve dysfunction, blocked blood vessels, and delayed growth in children. Chronic anemia : When CKD damages kidneys, they produce less of a hormone called erythropoietin (EPO) that stimulates the production of red blood cells in the bone marrow. This leads to a type of anemia known as anemia of chronic disease.

Metabolic acidosis: The inability of the kidneys to filter acids can lead to the buildup of acids, known as metabolic acidosis. This causes bone and lean muscle loss and speeds the progression of CKD.

Who Is at Risk of Kidney Disease?

Some people are at greater risk of kidney disease than others. Although there is some overlap in the risk factors of AKI and CKD, they tend to develop independently of each other. With AKI, the injury is usually the result of an acute episode of a chronic or severe illness, while CKD is usually the result of progressive damage from a chronic illness.

AKI Risk Factors A family history of AKI

Heart disease

Taking insulin for diabetes

Uncontrolled hypertension

Being over 65

Kidney disease

Liver cirrhosis

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)

Peripheral artery disease (PAD)

Having recent major surgery

Being hospitalized for COVID-19

Being severely dehydrated CKD Risk Factors A family history of CKD

Heart disease

Diabetes

High blood pressure

Being over 60

CKD is diagnosed more often in people who are Black, Latinx, Asian, or Native American than in White people in the United States.

Kidney Disease Testing: How to Diagnose Kidney Disease

Kidney disease is diagnosed with blood and urine tests. The tests evaluate the function of the kidneys in different ways and are collectively referred to as renal function tests.

The tests include:

Serum creatinine : This blood test measures a waste byproduct called creatinine, which is produced steadily as muscles are broken down. High creatinine levels mean the kidneys are clearing the byproduct as they should.

: This blood test measures a waste byproduct called creatinine, which is produced steadily as muscles are broken down. High creatinine levels mean the kidneys are clearing the byproduct as they should. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) : This blood test calculates how well the kidneys are working based on your serum creatinine levels and the expected values for your age, body size, and biological sex.

: This blood test calculates how well the kidneys are working based on your serum creatinine levels and the expected values for your age, body size, and biological sex. Urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR): This urine test can detect albuminuria , a condition in which damaged kidneys release too much protein (called albumin) into your urine. Kidney function is measured by comparing albumin levels with creatinine levels.

The underlying cause of kidney disease can be diagnosed with imaging tests (such as an abdominal ultrasound) or by obtaining a sample of kidney tissue with a biopsy.

How AKI Is Treated Acute kidney injury requires immediate treatment and may be reversible if diagnosed and treated quickly. The treatment of AKI typically involves: Intravenous (IV) fluids to replace lost fluids

Diuretics to treat fluid overload

Potassium-binding drug to remove excess blood potassium

Calcium gluconate to increase blood calcium levels

Hemodialysis (blood dialysis) to remove waste products and toxins from the blood

Chronic Kidney Disease Treatment

The treatment of CKD varies by the stage of the disease, the underlying causes, and other factors.

Lifestyle

Lifestyle changes are recommended at every stage of CKD to keep you healthy and slow the progression of the disease.

These include:

Limiting salt intake : People with CKD and hypertension should consume no more than 2,400 milligrams (mg) of sodium from all sources daily.

: People with CKD and hypertension should consume no more than 2,400 milligrams (mg) of sodium from all sources daily. Limiting protein intake : Talk to your healthcare provider about the appropriate amount of protein for your stage of CKD and how to balance your diet.

: Talk to your healthcare provider about the appropriate amount of protein for your stage of CKD and how to balance your diet. Quitting cigarettes : Cigarette smoking causes the narrowing of arteries and veins, further restricting blood flow to the kidneys. Smokers with diabetes also have a harder time controlling their blood sugar, even with insulin injections.

Smokers with diabetes also have a harder time controlling their blood sugar, even with insulin injections. Maintaining a healthy weight: This includes eating a balanced diet and exercising at least 150 minutes weekly. Shedding excess pounds helps lower blood pressure and blood sugar.

Medications

Different medications may be prescribed to manage the underlying causes and complications of CKD, including:

Dialysis

For the small proportion of people who progress to ESRD, dialysis may be needed to remove waste from your body when the kidneys can no longer do so.

There are two types commonly used:

Hemodialysis involves a machine that removes wastes and fluids from your blood. It is performed in a center three times weekly, with each treatment lasting four hours. There are also home units you can connect yourself to four to five times weekly.

involves a machine that removes wastes and fluids from your blood. It is performed in a center three times weekly, with each treatment lasting four hours. There are also home units you can connect yourself to four to five times weekly. Peritoneal dialysis is a procedure performed at home using the lining of the abdomen as a filter. Fluids are manually pumped into and suctioned out of the abdomen several times a day to remove waste. Newer continuous cycling machines allow you to do so while you are asleep.

Kidney Transplant

A kidney transplant is another treatment option for ESRD. Typically, when a person with CKD has an eGFR of 20, they are assessed to determine if they are a candidate for a transplant and placed on a waiting list.

The kidney may come from a deceased or living donor. The donor is ""matched"" so that their blood and tissue types are compatible, minimizing the risk of organ rejection.

A transplant can be performed without dialysis if the kidney failure is progressing slowly and the symptoms can be controlled with diet and medications. If not, a person may be placed on dialysis until a donor kidney is received.

Daily CKD Management

Managing CKD requires a commitment to good health. In addition to making lifestyle changes, the National Institutes of Health recommend that you aim for the following goals in your daily life:

Control your blood pressure : The blood pressure goal is less than 140/90 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) for most people. If you cannot do so with diet and exercise, speak with your healthcare provider about ACE inhibitors and other drugs that can help.

: The blood pressure goal is less than 140/90 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) for most people. If you cannot do so with diet and exercise, speak with your healthcare provider about ACE inhibitors and other drugs that can help. Meet your blood sugar goals : You must regularly check your blood glucose (sugar) levels and A1C (the average blood glucose levels over the past three months). The A1C goal for many people with diabetes is under 7%.

: You must regularly check your blood glucose (sugar) levels and A1C (the average blood glucose levels over the past three months). The A1C goal for many people with diabetes is under 7%. Build a sustainable diet : Building a healthy, balanced diet when foods are restricted is important. To better meet your daily nutritional needs, ask your healthcare provider for a referral to a dietitian certified in managing CKD.



: Building a healthy, balanced diet when foods are restricted is important. To better meet your daily nutritional needs, ask your healthcare provider for a referral to a dietitian certified in managing CKD. Manage your stress: Depression is common among people with CKD and can make the disease harder to manage. If you have trouble coping, speak with a mental health professional, connect with a support group, or reach out to friends or family members. Avoid drugs and alcohol, and try to get at least seven to eight hours of sleep per night.

It is also important to stay in touch with your care team. Your kidney specialist (nephrologist) monitors your lab results and adjusts treatment if there are changes in your kidney function. Let your nephrologist and care team know about any changes in your health or treatment, including those unrelated to your kidneys.

Can You Prevent Chronic Kidney Disease? Diabetes and high blood pressure are the number one and two causes of CKD, respectively. By avoiding (or properly managing) these chronic diseases, you may reduce your risk of CKD. This includes eating right, exercising routinely, maintaining your ideal weight, and quitting cigarettes.

Outlook

The prognosis (outlook) of acute kidney injury is generally good if treated appropriately. In some cases, AKI may be a one-off event without impacting your long-term health or life expectancy.

The prognosis of chronic kidney disease can vary by the individual. With that said, most people with CKD do not progress to ESRD because symptoms tend to develop in later life and can usually be managed with medications and diet. The most common cause of death in people with CKD is heart disease rather than kidney failure.

The risk of death is largely influenced by the stage of CKD. According to a 2017 study in Pediatric Nephrology, a 30-year-old male with an eGFR of 60 and over can expect to live to 79, while a counterpart with an eGFR under 15 may only live to 45.

Prognosis for End-Stage Renal Failure

For those who progress to ESRD, dialysis and kidney transplantation are the only options for survival. If neither is pursued, death usually occurs within several days or weeks.

Those pursuing dialysis have a far better outlook, with an average life expectancy of five to 10 years.

Success rates for kidney transplants are equally optimistic, with 78.2% of those who received a kidney from a deceased donor living for at least five years. Around 88.1% of those who received a kidney from a living donor surviving for a least five years.

Even recipients in their 60s can expect to live anywhere from 11 to 15 years after a transplant.","Some people are at greater risk of kidney disease than others.

675,675,https://agfundernews.com/hemp-hulls-could-contain-the-key-to-fighting-fatty-liver-disease-brightseed,Hemp hulls could contain the key to fighting fatty liver disease: Brightseed,"Disclosure: AFN’s parent company, AgFunder, is an investor in Brightseed.

Brightseed, a US startup exploring novel health and nutrition uses for plants, has discovered phytochemicals in waste hemp seed shells which could be used to treat metabolic health problems.

Brightseed’s AI-driven discovery platform, Forager, found two bioactive compounds — N-trans-caffeoyltyramine (NCT) and N-trans-feruloyltyramine (NFT) — in hemp hulls, the outer shells of Cannabis sativa seeds. These discoveries follow Forager’s earlier detection of the compounds in black pepper.

What’s more is that, according to the findings of two studies published in Nature‘s “Cell Death & Disease” journal, NCT and NFT have demonstrated potential to clear fat from the livers of mice, as well as from human cells.

“This is new insight. Forager identified a novel benefit previously unknown to science,” says Brightseed co-founder and chief operating officer Sofia Elizondo.

“In preclinicals, NCT and NFT triggered a new action on HNF4a central metabolic regulator to clear fat from the liver of mice and in human cells, opening up a new insight into the potential potency of these compounds,” she tells AFN.

The studies found that certain doses of NCT and NFT “triggered a total body reset in mice fed a high-fat diet,” while also leading to reduced liver fat, regulated lipid levels, restored healthy organ function, reduced body weight gain, and reduced liver inflammation in the animals. It also showed increased insulin levels in human cells, “signaling a resetting and restoring of metabolism from poor to healthy.”

Given this, the Brightseed team believes that NCT and NFT could be used in the not-too-distant future to treat non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) – and potentially other metabolic conditions, too.

NAFLD is characterized by an excessive build-up of fat in the liver. It can cause digestive and other problems and, in its later stages, liver dysfunction and even failure.

There are no approved treatments for the disease, which is thought to effect as much a quarter of the global population. It’s estimated that 80% of people who are obese have NAFLD.

Human clinical trials are now in progress to determine the two compounds’ potential impact on NAFLD and obesity, Elizondo says.

The other advantage of sourcing these phytochemicals from hemp hulls is circularity.

Hemp hulls are typically treated as a waste byproduct from the extraction of hemp hearts: the inner part of the Cannabis sativa seed which is valued for its nutritional profile.

If hemp hulls are shown to have utility in treating NAFLD, then they no longer need to be discarded; instead, they can become an additional value stream for the hemp and marijuana industries. It would also underline the health and nutrition potential of the cannabis plant beyond cannabinoids.

“Hemp seeds are abundant and hemp is [already] a highly sustainable crop for us to source these plant bioactives from. As we move to commercialization of NCT and NFT, we are exploring all avenues [for] potential partnerships,” Elizondo says.

Earlier this year, Brightseed partnered with Olam Food Ingredients, a division of Singapore-based agribusiness and commodities giant Olam, to explore potential new health applications of produce including black pepper and garlic. The San Francisco-based startup also has a longstanding collaboration with Danone; together, the pair have discovered 10 times as many compounds with potential health applications in the soybean plant than were previously known. Brightseed has also partnered with farmer cooperative and juice brand Ocean Spray to analyze the phytonutrient composition of cranberries.

According to Elizondo, Forager has “mapped 1.5 million compounds to human biological benefits” to date.","Brightseed’s AI-driven discovery platform, Forager, found two bioactive compounds — N-trans-caffeoyltyramine (NCT) and N-trans-feruloyltyramine (NFT) — in hemp hulls, the outer shells of Cannabis sativa seeds.

Over the past couple of months, the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) — the central government panel that monitors and permits GM activity — has given the go-ahead for field trials of several GM crops, also including rubber and newer varieties of cotton. This comes after almost two decades of slow progress in the area since GM cotton was approved in 2002.

While the trials have been approved on paper, there is still an apprehension of anti-GM activism derailing them.

“It is natural to have concerns about the safety of the crop. We have freedom of speech, so activists have the right to raise their issues. But it is a scientist’s job to provide evidence and data to show that the crop is safe to consume,” said Sanjeev Sharma of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR)-Central Potato Research Institute (CPRI) in Shimla, who is working on GM potatoes.

Potatoes to withstand late blight

Since 2005, Sharma has been working on developing a potato variety that can withstand a fungal disease known as late blight.

Late blight is caused by the pathogen Phytophthora infestans. It can also affect tomatoes and other plants in the Solanaceae family, which also includes peppers and brinjals. The disease spreads rapidly in cool, wet weather conditions and can cause significant damage to potato crops.

In India, the potato is one of the most important crops, and late blight is a major concern for potato growers. According to a report by ICAR, late blight can cause losses of up to 50 per cent in potato yield.

The disease can also render potatoes unfit for human consumption or processing, which can result in further economic losses.

In India, the average annual losses due to late blight have been estimated to be 15 per cent of total production, according to ICAR data. The disease is prevalent throughout the country, but losses are greater in hilly regions — where the crop is grown under rainfed conditions — than in the plains.

“Potatoes are the third most important food crop in the world after wheat and rice. In India, the crop is grown over an area of 2.2 million hectares — with an annual production of around 53 million metric tonnes. The productivity is around 23 to 24 tonnes per hectare,” Sharma said.

He added that 90 per cent of the crop is grown in the sub-tropical Indo-Gangetic region, where late blight occurs after every third or fourth crop cycle in epidemic form.

When late blight strikes, it can lead to a cost to the tune of Rs 70,000 crore annually for farmers, said Sharma. Traditionally, to manage the disease, insecticides and fungicides are required — adding to the cost of cultivation.

Moreover, when the pathogen is exposed to fungicides over time, it develops resistance to it. “Over a span of eight to 10 years, pathogens become resistant even to new varieties of blight-resistant crops that are developed through inbreeding,” Sharma said.

To work around this, the team has developed a new variety of potato that expresses a gene known as the RB gene. Taken from the wild potato species Solanum bulbocastanum, this gene makes the plant resistant to late blight.

The team began by importing GM potatoes under a material transfer agreement with scientists in the US. “That variety was cross-bred with the most popular Indian variety called Kukri Jyoti — which occupies more than 21 per cent of the acreage in India,” Sharma said.

The new GM variety, known as KJ66, will now undergo Biosafety Research Level (BRL)-1 and BRL-2 trials. The BRL-1 trials are confined experiments where sowing is limited to one acre of land for each trial location. Researchers cannot sow the seeds in more than a cumulative 20 acres at a time at this stage. In BRL-2 trials, up to a hectare (2.47 acres) of land can be used at each location.

“We are planning to conduct the trial in six different agri-ecological zones — three in the hills and three in the sub-tropical plains. We have received no-objection certificates from from the Meghalaya and Himachal governments for the trials. We have approached other states as well,” Sharma said.

The scientists are planning to sow the first seeds for the trial in the Kharif season this year in Shimla and Shillong.

As trials in different ecological zones will help the scientists better assess if the variety is suited to the entire country or if it must be limited to specific locations, the CPRI has also approached Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Punjab for permissions.

Making bananas more nutritious

Siddharth Tiwari, a researcher at the National Agri-Food Biotechnology Institute (NABI)- Mohali, has been working on improving the nutritional profile of bananas.

Commercially cultivated bananas are a seedless crop — which makes cross-breeding a tedious task. The process can take up to two decades to develop a consumer acceptable hybrid.

“GM technology is the best way to enhance the properties of bananas. We can only rely on biotechnological advances to improve the traits of bananas,” Tiwari told ThePrint.

For Tiwari’s team, the fight is not against any disease in the crop. Rather, they want to tackle anaemia and Vitamin A deficiency through a ubiquitous and affordable food source.

Tiwari said that Vitamin A and iron supplements in the form of tablets are not always viable, and fortifying existing foods with these nutrients can be a better approach.

NABI Mohali started working on the project in 2012. To introduce pro-Vitamin A, the team borrowed the NEN-DXS2 gene from a common banana variety in Kerala known as Nendran.

For OsNAS1 or OsNAS2 genes, which express iron, the research team turned to rice. “Now that we have all the permissions, we are expecting to start our trials within the next couple of months,” Tiwari said.

The trials — known as event selection trials — are planned in Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Assam, and Punjab this year. All the trials will be conducted within institutional premises.

“It will take two years for the plants to bear fruit, after which the scientists will analyse which lines are most promising, and those will be considered for further BRL trials,” he said.

Since the banana crop takes two years to bear fruit, it will take at least three years for the NABI Mohali team to be able to select the crop lines that show promise for further trials. Right now, the team has some 20 varieties of GM banana that they want to try out.

Hurdles & court cases

Since 2002, when GM cotton was approved in India, progress in the field of GM crops has been staggered due to controversies and activism against such crops.

The central government approved the commercial cultivation of Bt brinjal in 2009 after several years of field trials and consultations with various stakeholders. Following concerns about the safety and environmental impact of the crop, the government placed a moratorium on the commercial cultivation of Bt brinjal in 2010.

Despite the success of Bt brinjal in Bangladesh, the moratorium remains in place to this day. In 2020, the central government approved trials of Bt brinjal but dropped the idea when states did not issue no-objection certificates.

Even after the GEAC gave its approval for field trials of GM mustard, the crop has been embroiled in controversies. Activist Aruna Rodrigues filed a PIL in the Supreme Court, seeking a ban on GM mustard.

According to her application, more than 25 countries have banned GMOs, including France, Germany, Switzerland and Russia, while substantial restrictions on GMOs exist in more than 60 countries. The application demanded an inquiry into the approval process for GMOs. The case is still in court.

This has made scientists like Tiwari and Sharma wary of attracting too much attention to their field trials, although they hope that they will be able to prove the science behind them.

“We have seen so many recent advancements in technology. Bt brinjal is already growing in Bangladesh since 2015. Farmers of Bangladesh are getting so much benefit from the crop. The Philippines has also released its golden rice, which is under cultivation,” Tiwari said.

He went on to add that other developed countries such as the US and Canada are already growing GM crops such as soybean, maize and cotton. Canola oil — which India imports from Canada — is produced from GM seeds.

“We don’t see any complications or negative impacts of these products. Farmers and consumers have changed their perceptions about these crops,” Tiwari said.

He added that in light of the climate crisis, providing nutritious food for the world’s largest population is a big challenge.

“If the government supports us, GM banana could become part of the mid-day meals in schools and Poshan Abhiyaan — so that a single banana can provide sufficient nutrition to most of the vulnerable population,” he said.

Change in government stance

The spurt of new approvals for GM crops, including new varieties of cotton and rubber, clearly indicates that the central government is taking a pro-GM stance.

“I think the government is very positive about these technologies, which is why they are supporting it,” Tiwari said.

“I understand that the perception for GM seeds has changed now, with the government giving so many approvals for BRL-1 trials,” Sharma added.

“We are scientists — we can only give ideas. Ultimately, the approval comes from policymakers,” he said.

Eight new confirmed cases of the Marburg disease have been reported in Equatorial Guinea, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said.

This brings the total of laboratory-confirmed cases to nine and probable cases to 20 since the outbreak of the disease – a deadly one similar to Ebola – was declared in February. Twenty deaths have been reported.

“The confirmation of these new cases is a critical signal to scale up response efforts to quickly stop the chain of transmission,” WHO Africa Director Matshidiso Moeti said in a statement on Thursday.

Of the eight new cases, two were reported from the Central African country’s Kie-Ntem province, four from the Litoral province and two from Centre-Sur province.

The areas reporting cases are about 150 kilometres (93 miles) apart, suggesting a wider transmission of the virus, the WHO said.

Among the dead are two healthcare workers.

“We need to make sure healthcare workers are aware of all the precautions as they carry out clinical care of the patients and investigation of the disease,” Moeti told Al Jazeera, highlighting the need for personal protective equipment in order to protect medical staff.

“People in communities and families have to be aware of the risk of the presence of the virus in their midst and the precautions they have to take in order to minimise being infected,” she said.

Moeti also called on communities to carry out safe burials and not involve entire communities.

“We need to convince people that this way of saying bye to loved ones is not going to be the normal way because of the risk involved.”

Marburg virus disease is a viral haemorrhagic fever that can have a death rate of up to 88 percent, according to the health agency.

Symptoms include fever, fatigue and blood-stained vomit and diarrhoea. There are no vaccines or antiviral treatments approved to treat it.

However, if a person has a penis curve that causes pain or difficulty when having sex, they may wish to consider treatments. The penis is the male sex organ, and its primary functions include reproduction and urination. As with any other body part, penises can vary in length, girth, and appearance. Some penises are completely straight when erect, while many others curve upward, downward, or to the side. Penile curvature may be a worry for some people. However, slight curvature is common, and may be desirable and more compatible with some prospective partners. Penile curvature that does not usually cause discomfort is normal. People typically notice curvature during puberty or early adulthood. However, a curved penis that occurs suddenly, worsens over time, or causes painful erections may require medical attention. In this article, we will discuss the potential causes, symptoms, and treatment options for a curved penis. A note about sex and gender Sex and gender exist on spectrums. This article will use the terms “male,” “female,” or both to refer to sex assigned at birth. Click here to learn more. Was this helpful?

Definition Share on Pinterest Giambra/Getty Images A curved penis is a physical condition where a bend occurs in the penis during an erection. It may be present from birth or develop later in life. Some people may refer to penile curvature as bent penis, fibrous penis, and Peyronie’s disease. Penile curvature is common and typically does not affect functionality. In a 2018 Australian study , roughly 1 in 5 males reported a curve in their penis. Of those, only 1 in 6 males noted an adverse impact of penile curvature in their lives, complaining of pain or discomfort when they had an erection.

Symptoms Other than a bend in the penis, symptoms of a significant penile curvature may vary depending on the condition. For example, penile trauma symptoms may also include: a sudden snapping, popping, or cracking sound at the time of injury

a quick loss of erection

immediate pain and swelling in the penis

purplish discoloration and bruising of the penis and genital area

blood at the tip of the penis With Peyronie’s disease, the curvature may occur suddenly or gradually. Additional symptoms of Peyronie’s disease can include: flat, hard lumps under the skin on one or more sides of the penis

the penis significantly curving to one side with or without an erection

narrowing or shortening of the penis

painful erections

erectile dysfunction

inability to penetrate a sexual partner

Diagnosis Healthcare professionals can diagnose the cause of a curved penis by taking a detailed history and performing a physical exam of the penis. A clinician will likely refer the individual to a urologist. A urologist is a doctor who specializes in treating male reproductive conditions such as a curved penis. The doctor may also order an imaging scan of the penis, such as a penile ultrasound, to help determine the extent of injury or disease in some cases.

Treatment options A mildly curved penis that does not cause discomfort requires no treatment. When a curved penis causes pain, sexual dysfunction, or urinary problems, treatment is usually necessary. Doctors base treatment for a curved penis on the severity of the symptoms and underlying conditions. They may try a combination of treatment options, including : penile traction therapy

oral medications, including over-the-counter anti-inflammatories to relieve pain

penile injections

surgery According to current research , the greatest treatment benefits for a curved penis is with a combination of oral, topical, injection, and traction therapies.

If a person does not experience pain during an erection and the curvature does not prevent them from having intercourse, it is unlikely that they require any medical treatment. However, it is advisable for a person to contact their doctor if they develop any symptoms of Peyronie’s disease, penile pain, sudden worsening of their usual penis curvature, or their curvature leads to symptoms of anxiety or depression. If a person experiences penile trauma, it is essential that they receive immediate treatment . A penile fracture requires early surgical repair to avoid potential complications in sexual and urinating abilities.","However, a curved penis that occurs suddenly, worsens over time, or causes painful erections may require medical attention.

But one of the reasons we don’t yet have a cure for this disease is because of the complexity of the human brain – alongside the complexity of the disease itself.

One of the leading theories in the field suggests that Alzheimer’s disease is caused by the abnormal accumulation of two proteins called amyloid beta and tau in the brain, resulting in plaques and tangles. Amyloid plaques are clumps that form between neurons, which can damage surrounding cells, while tau tangles block communication between nerve cells.

Mitochondria help ensure our cells have the energy they need to function. ART-ur/ Shutterstock

For years now, scientists have been trying to understand how the accumulation of these proteins begins and how this affects brain health, leading to memory loss. Despite the huge amount of research that’s happened to date, there’s not been much success in treating and preventing Alzheimer’s disease.

This has led many experts in the field to wonder whether there’s something else we should also be looking at in the brain when it comes to understanding and curing Alzheimer’s disease.

A recent article in New Scientist describes an idea which could be important in the field of brain health. This article highlights an alternative theory: that damage to mitochondria (the energy-producing structures within cells) could actually be the cause of Alzheimer’s.

Energy deficit

Mitochondria are found in virtually all the body’s cells. They use both oxygen and breakdown products from food to make a high energy molecule known as adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP is like your cells’ energy currency – kind of like a rechargeable battery. Our cells use ATP for the energy needed to carry out everyday functions and maintain their own health. Once used up, mitochondria can reload it with energy.

Mitochondria also have a host of other functions important for cellular health, such as telling the cell’s nucleus (the cell’s hub of genetic information) to carry out important functions, and sending signals to other cells. They’re also packed full of antioxidants – molecules that protect cells from damage.

Mitochondria are particularly important for the brain. The human brain only accounts for around 2% of our total body weight, yet even at rest, the brain uses around 20% of the body’s total energy expenditure. As the control centre of the body, the brain needs this energy in order to carry out its many important functions which make virtually everything we do possible – whether that’s blinking, smiling or memorising a poem.

So, our brain cells – particularly our neurons, the brain cells that send and receive signals from our brain to the rest of the body – have high energy needs. This is why each neuron can contain thousands of mitochondria.

Our neurons need a lot of energy to make virtually everything we do possible. MattLphotography/ Shutterstock

It’s thought that neurons are formed at birth and do not get regenerated at any point in a person’s life. Instead, their mitochondria and cellular parts are constantly turning over and being renewed. This ensures that their mitochondria remain healthy – which in turns ensures the neuron can function properly. Essentially, this means that as long as the mitochondria are healthy, the neuron is too.

But what would happen if the mitochondria stopped being able to produce enough energy for our cells to carry out their functions and repair damage? This would mean the cells may start to accumulate damage. In neurons, this could result in damage – and even death.

This is the foundation of the mitochondrial cascade hypothesis.

ADVERTISEMENT CONTINUE READING BELOW

Mitochondrial loss

The mitochondrial cascade hypothesis was actually first published by scientist and clinician professor Russell Swerdlow in 2004. This landmark article reviewed numerous studies which had previously found evidence of mitochondrial damage in Alzheimer’s disease. In the paper, Swerdlow proposed a new theory suggesting that problems with mitochondria and their function could provide an alternative explanation for why Alzheimer’s disease develops.

However, despite increasing evidence showing mitochondrial loss in the neurons of patients with Alzheimer’s, the idea that mitochondrial dysfunction could be a cause has remained on the fringes of dementia research. There are many reasons why this is the case.

First, a large proportion of the limited funding given to dementia research in the past few decades has gone to scientists studying amyloid beta and tau. This was thanks to promising studies in the field which suggested that removing or reducing the amount of amyloid beta and tau in the brain could have an effect on cognitive function.

Second, until relatively recently the methods used to study mitochondria in humans have been limited – meaning that we’ve also been limited in our ability to detect, prevent or cure mitochondrial dysfunction. But developments in the field may soon make it possible to transfer healthy mitochondria into cells. This could therefore allow us to study what would happen if we replaced damaged mitochondria in the neurons of patients with Alzheimer’s disease.

But while it’s clear that problems with the brain’s mitochondria are linked to neurodegenerative diseases, there are still many questions we need to answer before we can start developing treatments. For example, we need to understand what damages the brain’s mitochondria, and how to prevent this damage.

Dementia is a complex disease. This may mean there isn’t a one-size-fits-all cure for it. It could be the case that we may need to target multiple different mechanisms in order to treat the disease.

Last month, the Food and Drug Administration announced it was investigating powdered formula linked to an Abbott facility in Sturgis, Michigan, following four reports that infants who had consumed it became seriously ill. Two of the infants have died. Abbott has issued a voluntary recall for some batches of its Similac, Alimentum and EleCare formulas.

Cronobacter is found naturally in the environment and can live in dry foods, including powdered formulas, powdered milk and starches, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It can affect people of all ages, but it is especially dangerous in infants.

Cronobacter is rare but serious

In addition to the four Cronobacter reports, the FDA also found one case of salmonella in an infant in connection with the Abbott facility. The agency has advised consumers to avoid Abbott powdered formula if the first two digits of the product code on the bottom of the package are 22 through 37; if the code includes K8, SH or Z2; or if the expiration date is April 1, 2022, or later.

Early signs of Cronobacter infection in babies under 1 year old are fever, crying, low energy and poor feeding habits. The bacterium can get into their bloodstreams and cause meningitis.

In older people, Cronobacter can enter the urinary tract or cause problems in cuts, scrapes or places where people have had surgery, according to the CDC.

The agency typically gets just two to four reports of Cronobacter in infants a year, although it notes that infection rates are not well understood because Minnesota is the only state that requires its Health Department to be notified of cases. In Minnesota, Cronobacter infections in infants under 1 year old must be reported within one working day. The four recent Cronobacter cases were reported in Minnesota, Ohio and Texas.

Bill Marler, a Seattle-based food safety lawyer, said thorough reporting of food-borne illnesses is important because it is a way to ""count people who are sick and to see what the common denominator is between them.""

""The more people who have their illness reported, the more likely it is you’ll figure out what the problem is sooner, so then you can get the product off the market so less people get sick,"" Marler said.

How to protect your baby

Abbott said in a statement that in its testing, no distributed product has tested positive for either Cronobacter or salmonella.

""Additionally, retained samples related to the three complaints for Cronobacter sakazakii tested negative for Cronobacter sakazakii,"" the company said. ""And the retained sample related to the complaint for Salmonella Newport tested negative for Salmonella Newport.""

Marler said concerned parents can protect their children from possible Cronobacter exposure by practicing good hygiene habits, like keeping bottles clean.

The CDC recommends that powdered formula containers be stored properly, with clean lids and scoops. For babies born prematurely or those who have weakened immune systems, parents should heat water that gets mixed with the powder to 158 degrees Fahrenheit, then let the mixture cool.

""This is a good reminder for parents to use good methods when feeding their kids infant formula,"" Marler said.","A recall of powdered baby formula from Abbott Laboratories is highlighting the danger of Cronobacter sakazakii, a bacterium that causes that causes rare but serious infections in infants.

Media type: Media release

Audience: General public

Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) has been detected in piggeries in New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria.

Australian Chief Veterinary Officer Dr Mark Schipp said JEV had been confirmed by laboratory diagnosis at one piggery in Victoria’s north, six piggeries in NSW, and in one piggery in Queensland.

“JEV is a mosquito-borne viral disease that mostly occurs in pigs and horses, but can cause disease in people and rarely other animals,” Dr Schipp said.

“Animals and people become infected through the bite of infected mosquitoes. It cannot be caught through eating pork or pig products. The disease is not transmitted from person to person.

“This is the first time the virus has been detected in southern Australia, and biosecurity authorities are working with their human health departments to understand the implications and risks of human exposure.

“The Department of Health and the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment are collaborating closely, together with state and territory counterparts.

“We are meeting regularly and working together to work through the next steps of this situation.

“We’re asking anyone who works with pigs or horses, even if they’re a pet in the backyard, to keep an eye out for and report any possible signs of this disease.

“The most common symptoms in pigs are mummified or stillborn piglets, or piglets who show neurological problems in the first six months of life. The disease tends to be asymptomatic in adult sows, but boars can experience infertility and testicle congestion.

“Horses can experience a range of symptoms. While most infected horses do not show signs of disease, some more severe signs of JEV in horses include fever, jaundice, lethargy, anorexia and neurological signs which can vary in severity.

“JEV is a nationally notifiable disease, which means if you suspect an animal is showing signs of the disease, you must report it (see contact details below). Measures should also be taken to protect animals from mosquitoes – for instance, applying a safe insect repellent and putting a summer rug on horses.”

Acting Chief Medical Officer Dr Sonya Bennett said JEV infections can be contracted by humans through the bite of a mosquito. There are no confirmed human cases in Australia at this stage, although this is under active investigation. “We are aware that several cases of encephalitis of unknown cause have been identified in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia within the past month.

“JE is also a notifiable disease in humans and health authorities across the country are on the alert for human cases and are in direct contact with people associated with the affected piggeries” Dr Bennett said.

“Pigs are the focus from a human health perspective as they can infect mosquitoes who then infect humans. This is not the case with horses.

“Severe illness arising from JEV infection in humans is rare and most people will have no symptoms at all if infected.

“However, a very small proportion of people infected may develop a serious illness such as encephalitis and experience symptoms including neck stiffness, severe headache and coma, and more rarely, permanent neurological complications or death.

“Encephalitis is the most serious clinical consequence of JEV infection. Illness usually begins with symptoms such as sudden onset of fever, headache and vomiting.

“Anyone experiencing these symptoms, particularly if they’ve visited regions in eastern Australia or South Australia where there has been high mosquito activity, should seek urgent medical attention.

“Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of infection caused by JEV in patients in affected areas with encephalitis and refer people for appropriate testing, after other common causes have been excluded.

“There is work underway to plan for targeted vaccinations. Two different vaccines are available for protection against JEV in Australia and are very safe and effective for both adults and children.

“However, prevention is always better than a cure and there are simple steps we can all take to avoid our exposure to infected mosquitos.

“People in areas of high mosquito activity in Eastern Australia should use mosquito repellent containing picaridin or DEET on all exposed skin.

“Wear long, loose fitting clothing when outside, and ensure accommodation, including tents, are properly fitted with mosquito nettings or screens.

“We will continue to meet with health authorities in the states and territories to progress the public health response to this disease.”

To report suspected JEV in pigs or other animals, contact your local veterinarian or call the national Emergency Animal Disease Watch Hotline on 1800 675 888.

A study has confirmed that government policies funding general practitioners (GPs) to provide structured chronic disease management improve long-term survival following stroke and stroke-like symptoms.

Published in The Lancet Regional Health - Western Pacific, The Monash University-led study was developed to determine the effectiveness of government-funded chronic disease management policies to improve long-term outcomes – survival, hospital presentations, and preventive medication adherence – following stroke/Transient Ischaemic Attack (temporary stroke-like symptoms).

Stroke is a lifelong condition, making it the third greatest cause of global Disability Adjusted Life Years and second for those aged 50 and over. Survivors of stroke have an elevated risk of recurrent stroke (approximately 11 per cent at 1 year, 26 per cent at 5 years), and most have additional comorbid conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes.

The 12,386 participants were identified through the Australian Stroke Clinical Registry (January 2012–December 2016) from 42 hospitals in Victoria and Queensland. Registry data was linked with state and national hospital, general practice, pharmaceutical, aged care, and death datasets. Registrants living in the community, not receiving palliative care, and who survived to 18 months following stroke/TIA were included.

Forty-five per cent of participants had a chronic disease management plan. Those with a plan had 26 per cent improved survival over the 12 months follow up and 16-23 per cent improved preventative medication adherence. Despite the health benefits, less than half of the cohort had received a chronic disease management plan.

The study, funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council, is the only national evaluation of a primary care policy aimed at incentivising GPs to provide structured and comprehensive chronic disease management.

Clive Kempson, from Clyde North in Victoria, participated in the study and had a chronic disease management plan. Clive, 59, survived a stroke just over seven years ago and felt abandoned by the system after a short stint in rehab.

Once given a management plan he felt supported and was able to receive essential medical care relevant to stroke survival and other conditions he lives with.

“With my management plan I felt empowered and involved in my health recovery. I asked lots of questions of my GP so I knew what was going on,” Clive said.

“Health Department decision makers don’t consider the long-term view. Having a management plan is essential to recovery and I feel very grateful to have one. I also advocate for other stroke survivors as a way of giving back.”

Project lead and author, Associate Professor Nadine E. Andrew, is from Monash University’s Central Clinical School and a Research Data Lead for the National Centre for Healthy Ageing.

“Our findings provide evidence of the population effectiveness of Australian Medicare-funded chronic disease management policies in primary care for improving the long-term survival of people living with stroke/TIA and adherence to secondary prevention medication,” she said.

“We provide evidence of survival benefits afforded by government policies that financially support primary care physicians to provide structured chronic disease management in the long-term management of stroke/TIA.

“We also provide a strong case for the ongoing provision of these plans within a universal healthcare system. Strategies to improve uptake at the GP level are needed and could include greater financial incentives and mandates, education for patients and healthcare professionals, and ongoing population monitoring involving audit and feedback.”

Co-investigator Associate Professor Monique Kilkenny, from the School of Clinical Sciences at Monash Health, strongly advocates for “efforts to ensure quality of care provided to patients with stroke for improvement of healthcare and patient outcomes.”

“The increase in overall hospital presentations represent an informed patient cohort more able to recognise the need for presentation to hospital,” she said.

People who are more optimistic or positive when they’re teens can lower their chances of being in the high-risk category for heart disease as adults.

Scientists have known for years that a person’s risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) can be lowered with lifestyle changes such as modifying diet, exercise, alcohol, and tobacco use. The new study shows a long-term association also exists between an adolescent’s psychological well-being and their risk of CVD as an adult.

“Here, we are recognizing the role of the environment and lifestyle in heart disease,” says Anand Chockalingam, a professor of clinical medicine at the University of Missouri, who is also a cardiologist with the University of Missouri Health Care.

“The biggest legacy that anyone can pass on for subsequent generations is optimism.”

“Some prior research has shown that more than 80% of all heart attacks can be prevented with a few simple lifestyle interventions at any point in the individual’s life. Although a heart attack may occur at the age of 55, the underlying buildup of plaque or atherosclerosis starts much earlier, often in teenage years. By exploring healthy habits and connecting with optimistic peers in the impressionable teenage years, it becomes intuitive to sustain a good lifestyle.”

This study emphasizes the value of optimism in an adolescent’s life, Chockalingam believes.

“Adolescents are simultaneously understanding the world as well as their own inner nature and mindset,” Chockalingam says. “Therefore, parents and other caregivers have a substantial role in the lifetime resilience and outlook of children. The biggest legacy that anyone can pass on for subsequent generations is optimism.”

20,000 adolescents

For the study in Benchmarking: An International Journal, researchers analyzed data from study participants involved with the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health). Chockalingam says the database served as a rich source of information for their study.

“The Add Health database meticulously collected data from over 20,000 adolescents when they were about 15 years of age, and followed up every few years afterwards with repeated surveys of several hundred health aspects for the same group of children,” Chockalingam says. “This gives us a unique window into the lifetime risk and correlation between various social, economic, psychological, and genetic health determinants.”

Chockalingam and colleague Sharan Srinivas, assistant professor of industrial and manufacturing systems engineering, have personal experience that reflects the results of their study. Srinivas credits his involvement in sports as a youth in India, including playing competitive tennis until age 18, for leading to a life and career advocating for a healthy lifestyle, both mentally and physically.

His passion, along with a continued interest in playing tennis, also led to a serendipitous research collaboration with Chockalingam. What began as a friendly game of tennis between two working professionals—Srinivas and Chockalingam—grew over time to include discussions of their mutual interests in health care-related research.

Eventually, the two began working together on research projects, and their expertise complements one another—Srinivas focuses on data analytics and industrial engineering tools to improve both the patient and health care provider experience; Chockalingam provides clinical insights and a health care provider perspective.

Optimistic outlook

Srinivas believes this study could help clinicians develop a personalized approach to lower someone’s CVD risk by integrating problem-solving techniques currently used by industrial engineers that place an emphasis on prevention and early detection.

“There are several step-by-step techniques established by industrial engineers that help with early detection of problems in the manufacturing and service industries,” says Srinivas, who has a joint appointment in the Trulaske College of Business.

“This is an opportunity to adapt some of these techniques to enable health care practitioners to monitor the well-being of an adolescent over time, because that’s the formative stage where your outlook on life is established, and it doesn’t change much after that.”

Srinivas acknowledges this study is only a first step toward establishing the association between adolescent well-being and CVD risk. He believes additional analysis of other data sets are needed to help overcome a limitation they had in this study, which was only taking a snapshot of someone’s life during adolescence and again during young adulthood. He says there needs to be additional insights into how people are doing in between these life stages.

In the future, Srinivas would like to explore the use of other industrial engineering and data analytics techniques, such as machine learning.

“We want to use these techniques to help predict the long-term risk for CVD among adolescents, and uncover the impact that underlying factors can have on a person’s chance to develop CVD, including the influence of a person’s well-being,” Srinivas says.

Kavin Anand, an undergraduate student at Stanford University, also contributed to the work.

An administration official said the U.S. is worried that the Russians are making the claim “to justify a false-flag operation or them using chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine themselves.”

“We do believe that we should be on the lookout for Russia to possibly use chemical or biological weapons,” the official said. The U.S. is also concerned that Russia could be making the claim to justify its continued invasion of Ukraine.

In a false-flag operation, one side of a conflict commits an act and tries to make it appear that the other side committed it, often to justify an attack on the other side.

Earlier Wednesday, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed Ukraine is preparing a provocation using poisonous substances. Igor Konashenkov, the spokesman for the ministry, said the point of the provocation was to blame Russia for the use of chemical weapons.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the U.S. has taken note of Russia's ""false claims"" and has also heard Chinese officials ""echo these conspiracy theories.""

""To be clear: this is preposterous,"" said Psaki in a statement, referring to Russia's claims.

Now that the claims have been made, ""we should all be on the lookout for Russia to possibly use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, or to create a false-flag operation using them. It’s a clear pattern, and no one should fall for it,"" she continued.

Security and disinformation experts continue to warn about Russia’s efforts to push a narrative about the conflict that seeks to provide seemingly legitimate reasons for its invasion. They have pointed to the war in Syria, where Russia backed the regime of Bashar Al-Assad, as an example of a government’s seeking to blame its own use of illegal weapons on the victims of the attack.

Russia's Defense Ministry said Wednesday that Ukrainians in the small city of Zolochiv brought in over 80 tons of ammonia and are teaching people in the area how to act correctly after a chemical attack.

His driving licence has also been suspended with immediate effect, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) and the police said in a joint statement on the same day.

A 28-year-old auxiliary police officer who was on duty suffered a severe head injury and was left unconscious after being hit by the vehicle.

The driver, a Singaporean, had cuts and both he and the officer were taken to the National University hospital.

ICA and the police did not give more details on the officer’s condition.

Initial investigations revealed that the driver was allegedly intoxicated and driving at high speed up the viaduct leading to Tuas Checkpoint.

He then purportedly lost control of his car and crashed into the observation point, causing the car to flip over and hit the officer.

“ICA’s first response team was dispatched to the scene to render assistance and cordon off the site. Officers from the Singapore Civil Defence Force and the Traffic Police were also activated,” the authority and police said.

The Singapore-registered car was seized and police investigations are ongoing.

ICA and Certis, which is the employer of the officer, are in contact with the officer’s family members to offer the necessary assistance and support.

ICA said: “(Our) officers stationed at the checkpoints, including auxiliary police officers, carry out their duties to safeguard Singapore’s borders.

“Motorists using the checkpoints need to drive safely and abide by traffic rules not just for their own safety but also the safety of our officers.

“We will not hesitate to take strict enforcement action against blatant breach of such rules.”

If found guilty of dangerous driving causing grievous hurt, the driver may face a jail term of one to five years. Repeat offenders could be jailed two to 10 years.

The penalty for the offence of driving while under the influence of drinks carries a fine of S$2,000 (RM6,645) to S$10,000 (RM33,224) and a jail term of up to 12 months, or both.

BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — The Russian tanks and missiles besieging Ukraine also are threatening the food supply and livelihoods of people in Europe, Africa and Asia who rely on the vast, fertile farmlands of the Black Sea region — known as the “breadbasket of the world.”

Ukrainian farmers have been forced to neglect their fields as millions flee, fight or try to stay alive. Ports are shut down that send wheat and other food staples worldwide to be made into bread, noodles and animal feed. And there are worries Russia, another agricultural powerhouse, could have its grain exports upended by Western sanctions .

While there have not yet been global disruptions to wheat supplies, prices have surged 55% since a week before the invasion amid concerns about what could happen next. If the war is prolonged, countries that rely on affordable wheat exports from Ukraine could face shortages starting in July, International Grains Council director Arnaud Petit told The Associated Press.

That could create food insecurity and throw more people into poverty in places like Egypt and Lebanon, where diets are dominated by government-subsidized bread. In Europe, officials are preparing for potential shortages of products from Ukraine and increased prices for livestock feed that could mean more expensive meat and dairy if farmers are forced to pass along costs to customers.

Russia and Ukraine combine for nearly a third of the world’s wheat and barley exports. Ukraine also is a major supplier of corn and the global leader in sunflower oil, used in food processing. The war could reduce food supplies just when prices are at their highest levels since 2011.

A prolonged conflict would have a big impact some 1,500 miles (2,400 kilometers) away in Egypt, the world’s largest wheat importer. Millions rely on subsidized bread made from Ukrainian grains to survive, with about a third of people living in poverty.

“Wars mean shortages, and shortages mean (price) hikes,” Ahmed Salah, a 47-year-old father of seven, said in Cairo. “Any hikes will be catastrophic not only for me, but for the majority of the people.”

Anna Nagurney, a professor of supply chains, logistics and economics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, said, “Wheat, corn, oils, barley, flour are extremely important to food security ... especially in the poorer parts of the globe.”

With Ukrainian men being called on to fight, she said, “Who’s going to be doing the harvesting? Who’d be doing the transportation?”

Egypt’s state procurer of wheat, which normally buys heavily from Russia and Ukraine, had to cancel two orders in less than a week: one for overpricing, the other because a lack of companies offered to sell their supplies. Sharp spikes in the cost of wheat globally could severely affect Egypt’s ability to keep bread prices at their current subsidized level.

“Bread is extremely heavily subsidized in Egypt, and successive governments have found that cuts to those subsidies are the one straw that should be kept off the camel’s back at all costs,” Mirette Mabrouk, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, wrote in a recent analysis.

War-ravaged Syria recently announced it would cut spending and ration staples. In nearby Lebanon, where a massive explosion at the Beirut port in 2020 destroyed the country’s main grain silos, authorities are scrambling to make up for a predicted wheat shortage , with Ukraine providing 60% of its supply. They are in talks with the U.S., India and Canada to find other sources for a country already in financial meltdown.

Even before the war threatened to affect wheat supplies in sub-Saharan Africa, people in Kenya were demanding #lowerfoodprices on social media as inflation eroded their spending power . Now, they’re bracing for worse.

African countries imported agricultural products worth $4 billion from Russia in 2020, and about 90% was wheat, said Wandile Sihlobo, chief economist for the Agricultural Business Chamber of South Africa.

In Nigeria, flour millers believe a shortage of wheat supplies from Russia would affect the price of products like bread, a common food in Africa’s most populous country.

“All of us need to look elsewhere” in the future, said Tope Ogun with Honeywell Flour Mills Plc, one of Nigeria’s biggest flour milling companies. “We might not get what we need to, and there is likely going to be an increase in the price.”

Nigeria has taken pains to reduce its reliance on Russian grains, with farmers moving to plant more wheat fields to try to meet 70% of the country’s demand in five years, said Gambo Sale, national secretary of the Wheat Farmers Association of Nigeria.

“We have the land, we have the people, we have the money, we have whatever we can need in Nigeria” to grow wheat, he said. “All we need now is time.”

The disruption can be felt as far away as Indonesia, where wheat is used to make instant noodles, bread, fried foods and snacks.

Ukraine was Indonesia’s second-largest wheat supplier last year, providing 26% of wheat consumed. Rising prices for noodles, in turn, would hurt lower-income people, said Kasan Muhri, who heads the trade ministry’s research division.

Ukraine and Russia also combine for 75% of global sunflower oil exports, accounting for 10% of all cooking oils, IHS Markit said.

Raad Hebsi, a wholesale retailer in Baghdad, said he and other Iraqis are bracing to pay more for their cooking oil.

“Once the items stored are sold, we will see an increase in prices of these items,” he said. “We will likely purchase alternatives from Turkey, and Turkey will no doubt take advantage of the situation in Ukraine and raise its prices.”

Farmers in the United States, the world’s leading corn exporter and a major wheat supplier, are watching to see if U.S. wheat exports spike. In the European Union, farmers are concerned about rising costs for livestock feed.

Ukraine supplies the EU with just under 60% of its corn and nearly half of a key component in the grains needed to feed livestock. Russia, which provides the EU with 40% of its natural gas needs , is similarly a major supplier of fertilizer, wheat and other staples.

Spain is feeling the pinch both in sunflower oil, which supermarkets are rationing, and grains for the all-important breeding industry. Those imported grains go to feed some 55 million pigs.

Jaume Bernis, a 58-year-old breeder with 1,200 swine on his farm in northeast Spain, fears the war will further increase the pain his business is facing because of climate change and drought .

Since October, Spanish pork products have been taking a loss from high costs, Bernis said. Those costs are driven by China stockpiling feed for its pigs as it claws its way out of a devastating outbreak of African swine fever.

In the first two days of Russia’s assault on Ukraine, the price of grain for animal feed jumped 10% on the open market in Spain.

“We are facing a moment of very elevated costs, and we don’t know what lies ahead,” Bernis said. “This is another cost of waging a war in the 21st century.”

693,693,https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/amazon-suppliers-linked-forced-labor-china-watchdog-group-says-rcna16452,"Amazon suppliers linked to forced labor in China, watchdog group says","Amazon has continued to work with companies in China accused of using forced labor despite public warnings about their work practices, according to a report published Monday by a nonprofit watchdog group.

The report from the Tech Transparency Project, a research group that is run by the nonprofit Campaign for Accountability and is often critical of large tech companies, found that Amazon’s public list of suppliers includes five companies previously linked by journalists and think tank researchers to “labor transfer” programs in China. The suppliers help produce Amazon-branded devices and products sold under house labels like Amazon Basics.

The report also warned that some of Amazon’s third-party sellers may be offering products made using labor from the western Chinese region of Xinjiang, such as cotton imports that are already the subject of U.S. sanctions.

“The findings raise questions about Amazon’s exposure to China’s repression of minority Uyghurs in Xinjiang — and the extent to which the e-commerce giant is adequately vetting its supplier relationships,” researchers from the Tech Transparency Project wrote in the report.

Amazon declined to comment on the specific allegations. In a general statement, Erika Reynoso, a spokesperson for the company, said: “Amazon complies with the laws and regulations in all jurisdictions in which it operates, and expects suppliers to adhere to our Supply Chain Standards. We take allegations of human rights abuses seriously, including those related to the use or export of forced labor. Whenever we find or receive proof of forced labor, we take action.”

The Australian Strategic Policy Institute, a think tank, estimates that from 2017 to 2019, at least 80,000 people from Xinjiang, a mostly Muslim region, were coerced to work in factories across the country as part of what the Chinese government calls “labor transfer” programs. The workers are often taken from their family homes and generally have few rights, according to researchers.

American companies are under increased pressure to ensure their supply chains don’t trace back to Xinjiang, where human rights groups estimate roughly 1 million Uyghurs, Kazakhs and other ethnic minorities have been detained in internment camps. Some of the facilities reportedly have factories built inside them. In December, President Joe Biden signed a law instructing officials to treat all imports from Xinjiang as tainted by forced labor unless proven otherwise.

Beijing has repeatedly rejected criticisms of its policies in Xinjiang. Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, said in a statement that “employment of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang is independent, voluntary and free.” He called reports suggesting otherwise “groundless.”

A number of Silicon Valley giants, including Apple, have been accused by journalists and researchers in recent years of working with companies that use forced Uyghur labor. Using public government documents and state media reports, the Tech Transparency Project, China Labor Watch and the tech news site The Information reported in May that Apple had worked with seven Chinese suppliers that allegedly participated in the labor transfer programs. Apple said it has “found no evidence of forced labor anywhere we operate.”

Amazon works with over 1,900 suppliers and says it conducts thousands of supply chain assessments every year, including on prospective manufacturers it may work with in the future.

In 2020, Amazon found that 8 percent of the firms it audited had labor issues related to “Freely Chosen Employment,” up from 3.2 percent the year before. It attributed the increase primarily to pre-production audits and said that “failure to meet our standards has been a factor in our decision to terminate hundreds of suppliers.”

Amazon’s business is closely entwined with China. But so far, the company has largely escaped the criticisms about forced labor that have been launched at its peers, said Katie Paul, director of the Tech Transparency Project.

“It doesn’t seem to get the same level of scrutiny,” she said.

The vast majority of suppliers responsible for producing Amazon-branded products, like its Kindle and Echo devices, are based in China, according to Amazon’s website. Many third-party sellers who offer products on its marketplace are also located in the country.

Relocated workers

The Tech Transparency Project identified three Amazon suppliers that have been linked to forced labor in China directly: Luxshare Precision Industry, AcBel Polytech and Lens Technology. It’s not clear what specific Amazon items they may be responsible for producing. The companies did not respond to requests for comment.

According to its public supplier list, Amazon works with two subsidiaries of Luxshare: Dongguan Luxshare Precision Industry and Shenzhen Luxshare Electro Acoustic Technology. Chinese government documents reported by The Information in May showed Luxshare Precision Industry, an electronics manufacturer, had allegedly accepted “as many as hundreds of Xinjiang laborers” between 2017 and 2020. NBC News has not independently verified those documents.

Lens Technology, a company known for producing glass screens for laptops and smartphones, has accepted thousands of Uyghur workers in recent years, according to Chinese government documents first reported by The Washington Post. After receiving negative attention about its labor practices, the company reportedly began phasing out Uyghur workers from its factories.

AcBel Polytech, another electronics maker, allegedly produced an official video several years ago in collaboration with local Xinjiang authorities describing how almost 200 workers from the region were sent to work for the company, according to The Information. Some of them were filmed chanting vows of loyalty in front of a poster of the Chinese Communist Party oath, and experts told The Information the video suggested they were coerced.

Experts say it’s difficult for Uyghurs to give informed consent to be transferred to factories because the chance of being punished if they refuse is high.

Darren Byler, an international studies professor at Simon Fraser University in Canada and the author of the book “Terror Capitalism: Uyghur Dispossession and Masculinity in a Chinese City,” said Uyghurs are typically sent in batches of around 50 people to factories in other Chinese cities, which may be hundreds or thousands of miles away from their families and homes.

The workers are usually segregated by gender and accompanied by a police officer and state employee. They live in on-site dormitories and are required to participate in Mandarin and ideological training. Byler said they typically have little control over their hours, place of employment and whether they can take time off.

“They’re not really able to make those choices. It’s all very state managed and controlled,” he explained. “Their free time is not really theirs because it’s within the control of the factory and also under observation of the state. So it’s a really coercive system.”

Complicated supply chains

The Tech Transparency Project identified two additional Amazon suppliers — GoerTek and Hefei BOE Optoelectronics — that were themselves accused of working with companies that have allegedly used forced labor. Neither supplier responded to requests for comment.

In its supply chain standards manual, Amazon states in bold text that it expects suppliers to “cascade our standards to your own suppliers and subcontractors.”

The findings highlight how it can be difficult for corporations to ensure they aren’t benefiting from coercive labor practices. Byler said suppliers facing scrutiny may try to add additional intermediaries into their systems, concealing where and how all of their labor is performed.

“Most likely what we’ll see is just a lot of this being hidden to a greater extent, which means that companies really need to demand that due diligence is essential to them doing business,” he said.

The Tech Transparency Project researchers also found that Amazon continued listing two subsidiaries of the textiles manufacturer Esquel on its supplier list over a year after another subsidiary was sanctioned by the Department of Commerce for allegedly using forced labor.

The U.S. government placed sanctions on Changji Esquel Textile in July 2020. But the other subsidiaries remained on Amazon’s website until as recently as December 2021, according to the Tech Transparency Project.

Amazon declined to comment about what might have accounted for the delay, and it’s not clear how long the Esquel subsidiaries may have continued to supply the company. On its website, Amazon says it last “comprehensively updated” its supplier list in July 2021, but that partial updates are “provided on a periodic basis.”

Esquel has denied that it uses forced labor and sued the U.S. government to get removed from its blacklist. “We continue to pursue litigation in order to fully remove Changji Esquel from the Entity List as soon as possible and clear our name,” a spokesperson for the company said in an email.

Xinjiang cotton for sale

The Tech Transparency Project also found evidence of Xinjiang labor on Amazon’s third-party marketplace.

The group identified one listing for “100% China Xinjiang towels,” which was still live on the U.K. version of Amazon’s website as of Monday. In another instance, an Amazon seller simply deleted references to Xinjiang from the description of its bedding, without making any discernible changes to the underlying products.

The Tech Transparency Project said the findings raise “questions about Amazon’s monitoring of such sellers.” Amazon declined to comment. The U.S. government banned cotton imports from Xinjiang in January 2021.

Byler said it will be difficult to eradicate forced Uyghur labor from global supply chains. But cutting off suppliers and sellers known to participate in transfer programs is a step in the right direction.

“It introduces more friction in the system and raises the economic and moral cost of what the Chinese state and these manufacturers are doing,” he said.","Amazon has continued to work with companies in China accused of using forced labor despite public warnings about their work practices, according to a report published Monday by a nonprofit watchdog group.

Here’s looking back at her fight with Lyme disease with which she was diagnosed in 2014.

Lyme disease is one of the most common vector-borne diseases in the US, caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, a kind of infected tick that transmits the germ to humans.

Lavigne narrates her debilitating experience with the disease on Good Morning America, where she reveals that it was the worst time of her life as she tried to convince medical practitioners that something was really wrong with her.

Lavigne states that during the first few months, she was awakened by night sweats and would feel so fatigued that she would be unable to get out of bed. “I saw my doctor right away, got blood tests, got swabbed, and they didn’t really know what was wrong with me.”

She visited several doctors, all of whom misdiagnosed her.

“They would pull out their little computer and say, ‘Uh, chronic fatigue syndrome,’ or ‘Why don’t you just play some piano, Avril?’ or, like, ‘Are you depressed?’ This is what they do to a lot of people that have Lyme disease. They don’t know what to tell you so they tell you you’re crazy,” she says, adding she suspected Lyme disease two months into experiencing the symptoms, following which, she visited a Lyme disease specialist.

Lavigne’s treatment included several rounds of antibiotics and close to five months of bed rest with her mother and her husband, Nickelback frontman Chad Kroege’s help.

In 2018, having recovered from the health-related hiatus, she wrote on her website, “Having gone through the battle of my lifetime, I’m stronger than ever and looking forward to sharing my renewed voice and energy for my life with my fans through this new music.”

The received wisdom is that eating more veggies protects against cardiovascular disease (CVD), which can lead to stroke heart attacks and death.

However, the new study, published in Frontiers in Nutrition, wanted to look at the independent effect of raw and cooked vegetables on CVD. Almost 400,000 participants, all without prior CVD, were included in the study.

Raw and cooked vegetable intake was measure during a questionnaire.

The average age was 56 and 55% of participants were women, During the 12 years of follow-up, 18,052 major CVD incidents were recorded and 4,406 CVD deaths occurred.

Interestingly, while raw vegetable intake was inversely linked to CVD, cooked vegetable intake was not.

Speaking about the findings, nutritionist Kim Pearson (kim-pearson.com) said: ‘ We can’t immediately dismiss these findings just because they don’t fit with our current understanding. Vegetable intake alone may not be the panacea when it comes to reducing cardiovascular disease risk, but eating vegetables is still important for many aspects of our health and diet does play a key role in reducing our risk of cardiovascular disease.

Studies on dietary habits and disease risk can be challenging to run. You tend to find that if someone has a higher vegetable intake, for example, they may also be more likely to implement other healthy habits like exercising regularly, eating less sugar, and so on. Therefore, it can be difficult to say for sure which of the habits is contributing to the reduced risk of disease.

Metabolic syndrome is the biggest predictor of cardiovascular disease. Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions that include high blood pressure, high blood sugar, weight gain around the middle and elevated blood lipids (cholesterol and/or triglycerides). My clinic specialises in weight loss and we see a lot of clients with metabolic syndrome. Eating a healthy, nutrient dense diet and minimising intake of highly processed foods is one of the best ways to prevent and reverse metabolic syndrome.

Vegetables provide essential vitamins, minerals and fibre and are still an integral part of our diet. We should not be discouraged from getting our (minimum) five a day. The more vegetables we will our plates with, the less room there is for refined, nutrient devoid carbohydrates and highly processed foods.’

Kim Pearson’s 5 tips for preventing cardiovascular disease

Consume a whole food diet. Ultra processed foods are detrimental to health in a wide variety of ways. Cook from scratch using whole foods as much as possible Take steps to reduce stress. Meditation and mindfulness practices, journaling, yoga, deep-breathing exercises and spending time in nature can all help. Get active. Sedentary lifestyles are not supportive to cardiovascular health. A daily walk is great but resistance exercise and elevating your heart rate regularly are also important. Limit alcohol and don’t smoke. Keep an eye on your units and aim to keep under the recommended 14 units per week. If you smoke, try to quit. Know your numbers. Blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar levels are all important numbers to be aware of. If these are elevated, take measures to reduce them naturally.","Does eating more vegetables reduce your risk of heart disease?

CAMBRIDGE, Mass., March 27, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cyclerion Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: CYCN), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company on a mission to develop treatments for serious diseases, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted orphan drug designation to zagociguat (previously CY6463) for the treatment of mitochondrial diseases.

Zagociguat is the first CNS-penetrant sGC stimulator to be developed as a symptomatic and potentially disease-modifying therapy for serious diseases that involve the CNS. In an open-label, 29-day study in patients with MELAS*, zagociguat treatment was associated with improvements in multiple disease-relevant biomarkers: mitochondrial function, inflammation, cerebral blood flow, functional brain connectivity, and visually evoked brain activation. These data coupled with data from preclinical studies in cells from mitochondrial disease patients and in zebrafish disease models support the potential of zagociguat as a treatment for MELAS/mitochondrial diseases.

“Orphan drug designation underscores the FDA’s recognition of zagociguat’s potential promise as a first-ever therapy for patients with MELAS, a rare, genetic mitochondrial disease,” said Peter Hecht, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Cyclerion. “Cyclerion is working expeditiously to advance this potential treatment to help address the immense unmet needs of patients with MELAS, a patient population in desperate need of therapies.”

The FDA's Orphan Drug Designation program provides orphan status to drugs defined as those intended for the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of rare diseases that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. Orphan drug designation qualifies the sponsor of the drug for certain development incentives, including tax credits for qualified clinical testing, prescription drug user fee exemptions, and seven-year marketing exclusivity upon FDA approval.

About MELAS

MELAS is a complex orphan disease affecting multiple organ systems, including the CNS, with different degrees of severity, and no approved therapies. MELAS, one of the most common primary mitochondrial diseases (PMDs), is caused by mitochondrial DNA mutations resulting in large clusters of familial cases. It is estimated that about 1 in 4,300 individuals has a mitochondrial disease, and ~80% of individuals with mitochondrial disease have CNS symptoms. The unmet need in MELAS is immense, symptoms can affect virtually any organ and cause intense fatigue, muscle weakness, and pain in addition to neurological manifestations, including stroke-like episodes, encephalomyopathy, seizures, and headaches. Life expectancy is estimated at ~17 years from onset of CNS symptoms. The disease impedes the individual’s ability to live independently and leads to social isolation and overall reduced quality of life.

About Zagociguat

Zagociguat is the first CNS-penetrant sGC stimulator to be developed as a symptomatic and potentially disease-modifying therapy for serious diseases that involve the CNS. The nitric oxide (NO)-soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC)-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) signaling pathway is a fundamental mechanism that precisely controls key aspects of physiology throughout the body. In the CNS, the NO-sGC-cGMP pathway regulates diverse and critical biological functions including mitochondrial function, neuronal function, inflammation, and vascular dynamics. Although it has been successfully targeted with several drugs in the periphery, this mechanism has yet to be fully leveraged therapeutically in the CNS, where impaired NO-sGC-cGMP signaling is believed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases. As an sGC stimulator, CY6463 acts as a positive allosteric modulator to sensitize the sGC enzyme to NO, increase the production of cGMP, and thereby amplify endogenous NO signaling. By compensating for deficient NO-sGC-cGMP signaling, CY6463 may have broad therapeutic potential as a treatment to improve cognition and function in people with serious diseases that involve the CNS, including mitochondrial diseases.

Stomper Anonymous was enjoying a screening of Japanese animated film 'Kaguya-sama: Love is War - The First Kiss Never Ends' at Golden Village (GV) in Plaza Singapura when he noticed something concerning.

A fellow cinemagoer was taking a video of the cinema screen on their mobile phone.

Anonymous said the incident occurred in Hall 6 on March 17, at 12.49pm. He was seated at J08 while the offender was seated directly in front at I08.

He told Stomp: ""The person was filming the movie. I believe it was because their partner was late, but it doesn't matter how much of the movie was filmed as it's illegal.

""Please do not commit such an irresponsible act. These films, especially the GV-exclusive anime films, were once at risk of being cancelled in local cinemas due to leaks.

""You love your favourite anime films? Then make sure not to compromise the integrity of these films.""

Stomp has contacted Golden Village for more info about the incident.

Recording of any kind is prohibited in GV theatres.

699,699,https://hub.jhu.edu/2022/02/22/vaccine-protects-against-severe-disease-six-months/,Study finds COVID-19 vaccine protection against severe disease remains strong at six months,"An analysis of research literature published last year before the omicron variant took hold found that while COVID-19 vaccines lose some effectiveness in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection, the vaccines retain nearly all of their ability to prevent severe disease up to six months after full vaccination. The study, which appears online February 21 in The Lancet, was led by researchers at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and the World Health Organization.

For their study, the researchers analyzed vaccination effectiveness data published last year from June 17 to December 2 in both peer-reviewed journals and on preprint servers, which post papers ahead of peer review. The data—detailed in 24 papers—covered dozens of individual vaccine evaluations preceding the emergence of the currently dominant omicron variant.

The researchers found that the level of protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection fell by about 21 percentage points, on average, in the interval from one to six months after full vaccination—whereas the level of protection against severe COVID-19 fell by only about 10 percentage points in the same interval. The authors defined ""full vaccination"" as one dose of Janssen vaccine or two doses of other vaccines. Booster doses were not evaluated.

""There is an indication here of waning vaccine effectiveness over time, though it is encouraging that protection from severe disease—the most worrisome outcome—seems to hold up well,"" says study co-first author Melissa Higdon, a research associate in the Department of International Health and a member of the International Vaccine Access Center (IVAC) at the Bloomberg School.

How long vaccines protect from infection and severe disease is one of the most urgent questions facing public health professionals and policymakers in the COVID-19 pandemic. To address the question, the researchers identified 24 studies, published in journals or posted on preprint servers June 17 to December 2 last year and covering the four major Western-developed vaccines—Pfizer, Moderna, J&J, and AstraZeneca. Many papers contained multiple vaccine evaluations. The researchers combined the data from the different studies using statistical tools to estimate an average change in vaccine effectiveness over time.

The finding that protection dropped against detected infection by an average of 21.0 percentage points over five months means that a vaccine providing 90 percent protection from infection at 1 month would provide only 69 percent protection at 6 months. The average drop was essentially no different among vaccinated persons older than 50 when analyses were restricted to just their data.

Similarly, protection against symptomatic illness from SARS-CoV-2 infection—which includes both mild and severe illness—dropped on average by 24.9 percentage points among persons of all ages, and 32.0 percentage points among older persons, from one month to six months post-vaccination.

Public health officials often emphasize vaccination for its protection against severe COVID-19. For this more serious outcome, vaccine protection apparently was more durable, with effectiveness dropping on average by just 10 percentage points during the one- to six-month interval. The slight drop was similar for older persons who are at increased risk for severe COVID-19 outcomes.

An analysis of post-vaccination infections with only the delta variant also found waning protection over time, suggesting that declining immunity—rather than changes in protection against the delta variant—was the principal reason for the waning vaccine effectiveness prior to the omicron wave.

The study is broadly consistent with others that have looked at vaccine effectiveness over time, and suggests that the four vaccines on average, during pre-omicron waves, have provided good protection against the severe outcomes that are most relevant to public health concerns.

""Omicron is still prevalent in many parts of the world, so it's going to be critical for COVID-19-related policymakers to pay attention to vaccine effectiveness studies in the context of omicron as well as any future variants—and to assess effectiveness over extended periods of time after vaccination, including vaccination with booster doses,"" Higdon says.","For their study, the researchers analyzed vaccination effectiveness data published last year from June 17 to December 2 in both peer-reviewed journals and on preprint servers, which post papers ahead of peer review.

700,700,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/web3-cryptocurrency-nft-tim-oreilly/,"Internet guru Tim O'Reilly on Web3: ""Get ready for the crash""","With Web3 touted as the next evolutionary stage of the internet, businesses and investors are eagerly hopping on the bandwagon. Tech giants including Alphabet, Facebook-owner Meta and Microsoft are staking their claim in the emerging blockchain-based economy, some non-fungible token companies are already valued in the billions, and cryptocurrency trading platforms are experiencing hockey stick-like growth.

To cut through the hype, CBS MoneyWatch spoke with tech luminary Tim O'Reilly, who among other things in his long career is known for publishing the world's first website and coining the term Web 2.0. Although he thinks the technology behind Web3 is promising, ""It's a long way from prime time,"" he said.

""It's very hard to convince somebody of a thing when financial gains depend on them believing in it,"" says tech luminary @TimOReilly, the publisher who coined the phrase Web 2.0, of web3 products like cryptocurrency and NFTs pic.twitter.com/i2pXR303hP — Dan Patterson (@DanPatterson) February 7, 2022

Indeed, the hubbub around cryptocurrency, NFTs and the metaverse, including sky-high valuations for startups, has a familiar ring to O'Reilly, who sees echoes of the dot-com boom and bust in the breathless boosterism around blockchain.

""Get ready for the crash,"" he said bluntly of the grandest claims made for Web3. The interview is is lightly edited for clarity and brevity.

Where do you put web3 on a development timeline, relative to historic computing breakthroughs?

Tim O'Reilly: As a metaphor, I personally put web three in about 1983. This has been my impression for some time. In a lot of ways, before the dot com bust back in the days when we had FTP and Telenet before the web actually was introduced, we we've had this incredible valuation bubble on a technology that's really not ready for prime time. With the dot com bust, the web arrived and it really exploded. Things really became possible that hadn't been possible before. By '95 you were, you were seeing really significant innovations in media and you're starting to see you innovations in e-commerce with Amazon. The capabilities that you could already see unfolding were quite large.

In the case of blockchain, it's so much obscured by the speculative value of cryptocurrencies, which are just basically a speculative asset.

Is all the money pouring into blockchain and Web3 a bubble?

Tim O'Reilly: I think there's a lot that's interesting about the blockchain, in theory. But when you really scratch, an awful lot of technical people have said, ""Hey, there's not a lot there.""

Now, that was also a response that many people had to the world wide web. To existing software developers of the day, it seemed trivial. So even though the technology is slow and very expensive, and it's hard to use distributed databases, there's a lot of investment pouring into the space, and people are trying to figure out actual things that might actually be useful. And I think that it is certainly possible.

Web3 is attributed to the idea that there's going to be a new decentralized web based on cryptography and the blockchain. I defined this term ""Web 2.0"" 17 years ago, and my whole point was that Web 2.0 was the second coming of the web after the dot-com bus — that's how I defined it.

When people ask me about Web3, I say the same thing: We won't know what Web3 is until after the current bubble pops — because we're in the middle of a bubble, just like the dot-com bubble, where there's all kinds of crazy startups getting outrageous valuations, with less to show for it.

What's the difference between blockchain tech, cryptocurrency and NFTs?

In the case of blockchain, it's so obscured by the speculative value of cryptocurrencies, which are just basically a speculative asset. They're not intrinsically valuable or useful. And then you kind of get this layer of NFTs, which are that — only more so. They don't even actually have a technical foundation They're not even fully part of the blockchain. You look at OpenSea

the largest NFT marketplace, and it has 600,000 users.

By the time the web got to these kinds of valuations, we were talking about hundreds of millions of users. So I believe that it really is a pretty serious speculative bubble on a very small foundation. That being said, once you get those bubble valuations, it does attract a lot of capital and talent — and people may start really building something on top of it.

With cryptocurrency you just have to think about that as gambling. You're at the race track and there's some horse that you think is gonna come in first. Sometimes you're right and maybe you'll make a bunch of money. But you don't actually think of that as an investment.

What's your advice to the most ardent champions of cryptocurrency and NFT — the true believers?

There are two categories of true believers, in my mind. There are those who, for example, are building a new decentralized user-empowering financial system. And to them, history teaches us that there will always be new avenues for power to become centralized. In fact, the entire history of the computer industry was radical openness, which led to a lot of innovation, which later led to closing it down.

For example, IBM released the PC specs. Everybody could build a PC. Michael Dell was a college student and started Dell from his dorm room, which was radical decentralization. And then Microsoft figured out how to recentralize around software. Later, we have the internet and open-source software. And guess what? Along come companies like Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Facebook. They figure out how to centralize on top of that foundation.

So even if you're a true believer in blockchain technology as a power for decentralization, you should look for the next vectors of recentralization.

Already we see them. Blockchain turned out to be the most rapid recentralization of a decentralized technology that I've seen in my lifetime. It took a decade to recentralize in the case of the PC. It took a decade in the case of the web. But it took only a couple years with bitcoin before the majority of the value was held by a very small group of people.

It's kind of like a pyramid scheme. So I believe that if you're a true believer in the technology, look for the ways that your belief will be undermined.

There's a second class of true believer, and that's really the crypto. You know, a believer in the crypto valuations. If they've diversified, maybe they've diversified Dogecoin into some other coin that they hope will pop up in the same way.

Whatever you do, don't borrow against the value of your crypto holdings. If you do, you will be seriously underwater. You will not just lose your imagined fortune, you will be bankrupt in the real world. The financial innovation of being able to borrow against your crypto, boy, that's a really bad, bad, bad, bad thing for a lot of people

How long until the metaverse — which as it's currently envisioned is basically a massive virtual reality social network — ready for prime time?

The metaverse itself is full of bubble hype. The Meta Quest2, yeah, they're selling a bunch of 'em, but the technology is a long way from prime time. If you were to compare this to where the web was before it became super useful, we're a long way from that. I think metaverse is probably a decade or more away from being really useful. And even then, how much time will people spend in this VR online space? I don't really know. Financial, cultural and political norms are changing.

I could be wrong about all of this. We're in a period of great fluidity around norms. We see this in politics, where things that were previous unthinkable are now being widely practiced. And I think we're seeing the same thing in investment. With cryptocurrency, what we would formerly have called stock manipulation is, in some sense, becoming part of a hype cycle. As a society, we're trying to figure out new norms.","With Web3 touted as the next evolutionary stage of the internet, businesses and investors are eagerly hopping on the bandwagon.

Vancouver billionaire, and Lululemon Athletica Inc. (Nasdaq:LULU) founder, Chip Wilson has committed $100 million to fight the degenerative disease known as facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), and create a new organization named Solve FSHD.

Wilson, now 67, was diagnosed with FSHD when he was 32 years old. He said his upper body is ""very wasted,"" and his legs have lost significant muscle tissue.

Wilson foresees a time in the not too distant future when he will need to use a wheelchair, he said.

“I can still walk, but I must be very intentional and present, or I will trip and fall,"" said Wilson. ""I do see a day when I will be unable to walk on my own.”

Solve FSHD's mission is to accelerate research into new therapies and find a cure for the disorder by 2027.

Wilson explained at a March 8 press conference that his whole life has been about athletics.

""From an athlete's point of view, a decrease in muscle ability is highly recognizable – even a drop of 2 per cent strength I can notice right off the bat, while maybe the normal person isn't [able to notice that,]""

""I'm not saying it's like Muhammad Ali with Parkinson's [Disease,] but boy, I feel sometimes like – being a high-level athlete and then being taken down with this – it's not what I saw for myself.""

FSHD is a type of muscular dystrophy in which there is progressive muscle degeneration, and weakness, leading to an inability to lift objects. People with FSHD can have trouble grooming themselves or walking on their own.

It gets its name from the parts of the body that it affects the most. The progressive loss of skeletal muscle, where weakness is most noticeable is across the face (facio), back (scapula) and upper arms (humeral.)

The rare disease is said to affect fewer than 5,000 people in Canada.

Forbes' daily updated estimate for Wilson's wealth is about US$4.8 billion, according to its website this morning.

He still owns a significant stake in Lululemon, despite not being active in management or on the board in years. He also has a significant holding in Amer Sports, which owns brands such as Arc'Teryx. His Low Tide Properties owns real estate in Vancouver and other cities.

The CDC reported that an estimated 37 million US adults have chronic kidney disease — and most are undiagnosed. In 2017, the CDC reported that nearly 10,000 children and adolescents are living with end-stage renal disease, or end-stage kidney disease.

Lindstrom continued, sharing that Exodus visits the doctor ""very often.""

""I make sure that his creatinine levels are at the levels he needs to be to keep him stable,"" Lindstrom said. ""He's an amazing child. He's so strong.""

On Friday, Lindstrom shared a video of Exodus to her Instagram account to commemorate National Kidney Day, which was observed on Thursday.

Parents or customers with impacted product should visit similacrecall.com or call +1-800-986-8540

ABBOTT PARK, Ill., Feb. 17, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Abbott (NYSE: ABT) is initiating a proactive, voluntary recall of powder formulas, including Similac, Alimentum and EleCare manufactured in Sturgis, Mich., one of the company's manufacturing facilities. The recall does not include any metabolic deficiency nutrition formulas.

Abbott is voluntarily recalling these products after four consumer complaints related to Cronobacter sakazakii or Salmonella Newport in infants who had consumed powder infant formula manufactured in this facility.

Additionally, as part of Abbott's quality processes, we conduct routine testing for Cronobacter sakazakii and other pathogens in our manufacturing facilities. During testing in our Sturgis, Mich., facility, we found evidence of Cronobacter sakazakii in the plant in non-product contact areas. We found no evidence of Salmonella Newport. This investigation is ongoing.

Importantly, no distributed product has tested positive for the presence of either of these bacteria, and we continue to test. Abbott conducts extensive quality checks on each completed batch of infant formula, including microbiological analysis prior to release. All finished products are tested for Cronobacter sakazakii, Salmonella Newport and other pathogens and they must test negative before any product is released. Additionally, retained samples related to the three complaints for Cronobacter sakazakii tested negative for Cronobacter sakazakii. And the retained sample related to the complaint for Salmonella Newport tested negative for Salmonella Newport.

While Abbott's testing of finished product detected no pathogens, we are taking action by recalling the powder formula manufactured in this facility with an expiration of April 1, 2022, or later. No Abbott liquid formulas, powder formulas, or nutrition products from other facilities are impacted by the recall.

Cronobacter sakazakii is commonly found in the environment and a variety of areas in the home. It can cause fever, poor feeding, excessive crying or low energy as well as other serious symptoms. It's important to follow the instructions for proper preparation, handling and storage of powder formulas.

""We know parents depend on us to provide them with the highest quality nutrition formulas,"" said Joe Manning, executive vice president, nutritional products, Abbott. ""We're taking this action so parents know they can trust us to meet our high standards, as well as theirs. We deeply regret the concern and inconvenience this situation will cause parents, caregivers and health care professionals.""

What Parents and Caregivers Should Do

The products under recall have a multidigit number on the bottom of the container starting with the first two digits 22 through 37, contains K8, SH, or Z2 and with an expiration date of April 1, 2022, or after.

To find out if the product you have is included in this recall, visit similacrecall.com and type in the code on the bottom of the package, or call +1-800-986-8540 (U.S.) and follow the instructions provided. No action is needed for previously consumed product. If you have questions about feeding your child, contact your healthcare professional.

University of Otago research shows chronic kidney disease is more prevalent among the Pacific population than previously thought.

Study co-author professor Rob Walker told Morning Report more intervention is needed because the disease is hurting a group already known to experience inequalities in health care.

""We looked at two health providers in South Auckland providing a large amount of care to Pacific people, when we looked at how many had been tested for chronic kidney disease we found an incident of 16 percent in the Samoan population.

""But if you look at those who actually had tested their kidney function, then the prevalence was as high as 33 percent so there are very alarming high figures in the Samoan community but also in other Pacific Island communities as well,"" Walker said.

He said the disease was also found in Māori communities at a rate of around 24 percent.

If not addressed the prevalence of kidney disease had the potential for long-term health impacts on both affected individuals and their communities, he said.

Poverty played a part, with difficulty accessing healthcare meaning many failed to be diagnosed at the right time.

Walker said the disease was presenting in Maori and Pacific people in an age range 10-15 years younger than non-Māori and non-Pacific communities.

He said this was particularly concerning as many in that age-range were the bread winners for their families.

""It's hitting those in their forties who are obviously the major income earners for families, the major care supporters for their families so the actual ramifications are much much higher than we expect.""

Raising awareness was key to addressing the prevalence of disease amongst these communities but screening for the disease during medical check-ups was the first line of defence, he said.

""Unfortunately, kidney disease is silent it doesn't have a flag saying you've got kidney disease so we need to be able to look for it each time.""

He said measuring blood pressure, and testing both urine and blood were the key steps to assessing the function of the kidneys.

Walker said with an early diagnosis there were effective interventions that could reduce the risk of the disease worsening.","A medical expert says more needs to be done about chronic kidney disease in New Zealand.

Public health doctors want a dangerous form of Strep A added to the list of diseases that have to be formally reported to health officials.

The Public Health Communication Centre said New Zealand was lagging behind other developed countries because invasive group A streptococcus was not a notifiable disease here.

Strep A is a common bacteria carried by many people but when it turns into its invasive form, it can become deadly, causing blood poisoning, pneumonia or nectrotising fasciitis.

Public health research fellow Julie Bennett said they suspected there were about 500 cases a year of invasive group A strep here but did not know for sure.

Making it a notifiable disease would mean they could keep better track of it, including genetic sequencing to identify the strains circulating.

It would also save lives, she said.

""We can identify people who are sick to make sure they get the treatment they need but we can also identify any close contacts so they can have the management that they require,"" she said.

That was because it would allow contact tracing measures to be put in place and close contacts could be treated if need be.

The disease was increasing around the world and many other developed countries made it compulsory to notify incidents of it, she said.","Photo: 123RFPublic health doctors want a dangerous form of Strep A added to the list of diseases that have to be formally reported to health officials.

709,709,https://www.defensenews.com/air/2022/03/01/heres-why-a-no-fly-zone-over-ukraine-is-off-the-table/,Here’s why a no-fly zone over Ukraine is off the table,"WASHINGTON — In response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the West has responded with devastating sanctions and a swift condemnation and isolation of Russia as well as by sending arms and other support to Ukraine.

But one option the Biden administration has definitively taken off the table: imposing a no-fly zone over Ukraine.

Experts told Defense News a no-fly zone would present multiple challenges — up to and including worries it could ignite a larger conflict between Russia and NATO.

“As much as we would love to say no-fly zones are super easy and it’s a clean way of doing business, this is simply not the case,” Heather Penney, a former F-16 pilot and senior resident fellow at the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies, said in an interview.

As Russian forces advanced on key Ukrainian cities, calls to impose a no-fly zone have increased. In a tweet Tuesday morning, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he had “emphasized the need to close the sky over” Ukraine in a telephone conversation with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.

That’s not happening, the press secretaries for the White House and Pentagon said Monday.

In a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said “that’s not a good idea,” adding that President Joe Biden does not want to risk putting the United States military in conflict with Russia.

“What that’d require is implementation by the U.S. military,” Psaki said. “It would essentially mean the U.S. military would be shooting down planes, Russian planes. That is definitely escalatory.”

For a no-fly zone to be credible, Penney said, the U.S. or NATO would have to shoot down any Russian aircraft or air defenses violating it — or the Russians would have to believe the U.S. would open fire so it would steer clear of Ukrainian airspace. If the U.S. or NATO declares a no-fly zone and doesn’t enforce it, it becomes a paper tiger.

“Do we want our credibility tested that way?” said Rachel Rizzo, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Europe Center.

Penney said the U.S. opening fire on Russian forces would upend the delicate network of international support for Ukraine the administration and Europe have created.

“To be credible, we would have to be willing to take that first shot,” Penney said. “Starting that kinetic war with Russia is something that the administration has been very careful to avoid. Every element of escalation has been initiated from Russia, and that has been key to a lot of the international support for Ukraine.”

John Venable, a defense policy expert from the Heritage Foundation and former F-16 pilot, agreed. “A no-fly zone would be a declaration of war in [Russian President Vladimir] Putin’s mind,” he said.

Penney said the debate over a no-fly zone is what happens when neither side in a conflict achieves air superiority in a conflict, or displays “credible combat airpower” — though she said she fears Russia will do just that in the coming days.

Ukraine did not have the fighters and air defenses it needed to drive Russian aircraft out of its airspace, she said. And Russia, for whatever reason, did not commit the air forces it would need to definitively seize air superiority in the first days of the conflict.

“What we expected is not how things have gone down,” Penney said.

That is likely to change as Russia shifts course and commits more forces to the invasion, Penney said.

“The Ukrainian air force has put up a valiant effort to defend their airspace and their territory,” she said. “But they’ve been unsuccessful because they did not have the capabilities or the capacity, both from a fighter perspective and from an air defense perspective [such as surface-to-air missiles].

Ukraine has used its Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2 combat drones very well, Penney said.

And Ukraine has lauded and mythologized its fighter pilots as heroes and emblems of national resistance, rallying around morale-boosting aerial victories over Russian aircraft.

But if Ukraine had definitively kept control of its skies, Penney said, its air force could do a lot more to destroy massed Russian forces. One potential target could have been the 40 mile-long Russian military convoy spotted outside of Kyiv in satellite images, she said, similar to the so-called “Highway of Death” attack on hundreds of Iraqi army vehicles retreating on six-lane Highway 80 from Kuwait to Basra in 1991.

Highways can allow militaries to rapidly and efficiently move large numbers of their vehicles and heavy equipment without risking them getting bogged down in mud or other unforgiving terrain. But they also can constrain forces and make them an easy target, Penney said — if their enemy has control of the skies.

A ‘night and day difference’

After the Gulf War, the U.S. and allies created no-fly zones over northern and southern Iraq dubbed operations Northern Watch and Southern Watch.

Operating from Incirlik Air Base in Turkey for the north, and bases in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Bahrain for the south, U.S. aircraft, alongside British and French allies, conducted aerial reconnaissance, airborne command and control using E-3 Airborne Warning and Control System, or AWACS, aircraft, and strikes against Iraqi air defenses.

Iraqi aircraft infrequently challenged the no-fly zone, but came under fire when they did. U.S. forces shot down two Iraqi MiG fighters that violated the no-fly zone in 1992 and 1993, as well as two Su-22 fighters in March 1991.

But maintaining those no-fly zones until the outbreak of the Iraq War in 2003 was a considerable effort.

And a no-fly zone over Ukraine would be a “night and day difference” from Iraq, Venable said.

Dave Deptula, a retired Air Force lieutenant general who commanded Operation Northern Watch in 1998 and 1999, said each Iraqi no-fly zone typically had about 50 U.S. and allied aircraft on hand, to fly patrols a couple hours each day. Flying around the clock would have taken much more, he said.

Flying around-the-clock air patrols over Ukraine — a nation that covers more than twice the area of the Iraqi no-fly zones — would easily take hundreds of fighters, said Deptula, now dean of the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies.

“This is not just something you flip a switch and, OK, we’re gonna put a no-fly zone up,” Deptula said. “It requires extensive preparation and definition [of the mission and objectives] to be effective.”

It would also mean thousands of airmen across multiple bases to fuel, arm and maintain these fighters — not to mention a significant aerial refueling infrastructure to keep them in the air, and ISR aircraft such as the AWACS.

The Iraqi no-fly zone came after that nation’s air force, defenses and command and control were all but wiped out — a situation that doesn’t exist in Ukraine. A no-fly zone there would require a significant suppression of enemy air defense, or SEAD, effort to take out Russian defenses such as the highly capable S-400 surface-to-air missile system, likely with F-22 Raptors and F-35 Lightning IIs.

But the U.S. or NATO would very likely lose aircraft in such a mission, Venable said — and trying to rescue downed pilots in such a volatile region would test the limits of the military’s combat search-and-rescue capability.

Penney said the U.S. needs to look closely at Russia’s difficulties in the skies over Ukraine and draw lessons for how to establish, and the importance of, air superiority. For the last two decades, the U.S. has maintained “de facto air dominance” anywhere it has operated, she said.

That won’t be the case in the future, if war breaks out with China — or Russia.

“We’ve really taken [air superiority] for granted,” Penney said. “Our Air Force is the oldest and smallest that it’s ever been, and we could find ourselves in similar situations [as Russia], because we too may lack the capability and capacity.”

The pair married in Singapore in 2020 and entered into an agreement that the man would pay his wife S$2,000 monthly and provide for her daughter from another marriage.

However, the lawyer stopped paying his wife maintenance from August 2021 and she resorted to borrowing money from her friends.

She took to court to get her husband to pay spousal maintenance, seeking a monthly sum of S$8,500, including S$3,500 for rental.

In a judgment published on Saturday (Mar 24), District Judge Kathryn Thong ordered the 53-year-old lawyer to pay his 37-year-old Russian wife S$2,592 as monthly maintenance from December 2021.

Once the wife gets a rental home, her husband is to pay an additional S$3,500 monthly for rent. In total, he will have to pay her S$6,092 monthly once she gets rental accommodation.

The man was also ordered to pay his wife's medical bills.

THE COUPLE'S STORY

The court heard that the couple met about five years ago. The woman wanted to live and study in Singapore, and for her daughter to study here as well.

She approached the lawyer, who was a partner at a law firm at the time and had been an advocate and solicitor for about 25 years.

She asked the man for legal advice on immigration matters and eventually obtained a student's pass and studied in Singapore.

The man began showering her with gifts and took her out. They began dating and the man sought the woman's hand in marriage in October 2019.

He splurged on her with expensive dinners and presents, boasting of his wealth and promising to provide for her if she married him.

He paid for all her expenses from October 2019 and gave her S$1,300 a month for rental. He also transferred a monthly sum of S$500 to her Russian bank account for her mother in Russia.

In June 2020, the couple got married. They entered into a signed agreement before an advocate and solicitor that stated its terms were to take effect upon the solemnisation.

In the agreement, the man said he would pay his wife S$2,000 monthly and also provide for her daughter.

The agreement also stated that all property acquired by the husband in marriage with the wife would be divided in half in the event of divorce.

The property of the wife, whether or not it was acquired during the course of the marriage, would not be subject to division under any circumstances, the agreement stated.

The agreement also stated that the man was ""obliged"" to transfer S$100,000 to the woman by a date in July 2020.

The woman later moved into a unit in Tanglin with her daughter, while the man stayed with his mother in Bukit Timah and visited his wife.

WIFE DISCOVERS SEX CALLS

Towards the end of March 2021, the woman discovered that her husband had been engaging in paid sexual video calls with Russian women both in and outside of Singapore.

She confronted him and forgave him, but later found that he had not stopped his ways and drove him out of the Tanglin unit.

The man stopped paying for his wife's expenses, including her daughter's school fees. He also withdrew his sponsorship of his wife's long-term visit pass and asked the woman to move out by end July 2021.

He began spending nights in the Tanglin unit.

In August 2021, he stopped giving his wife any money. The woman commenced a suit in the State Courts against her husband in November 2021 and filed a maintenance claim in the Family Justice Courts in December 2021.

At the time of the hearing, she was still staying in the Tanglin unit with her daughter but was looking for alternative accommodation.

THE WIFE'S CASE

During the trial, the woman said her husband had aggressively pursued her, painting a rosy picture of their future together in Singapore.

He said he had a business in Malaysia and would be obtaining about S$500,000 because of a case he was working on.

She said she believed he would provide for her and her daughter, but instead, she had to borrow money from her friends after he stopped paying maintenance.

She said she owed her friends S$11,000 as of mid-January 2022.

She said she could not work on a short-term visit pass, and that her husband should pay her expenses as he had been doing.

THE HUSBAND'S CASE

The man said that his wife had failed to fulfil her wifely duties towards him on many levels, including failing to welcome him into their home or bed and to be cordial and supportive to make theirs a successful marriage.

He also said she failed to share cooking and laundry duties and said she could be entitled to maintenance only if she ""behaved"" as a wife.

He said he was already paying for the Tanglin unit so his wife had accommodation.

He also said the ongoing suit in the State Courts means the wife is no longer entitled to any maintenance.

He claimed that his wife had properties in Russia, on top of the money he had already given her.

Asked about the agreement, he said he did not believe it was legally enforceable at the time he entered into it.

He also said he had fallen on hard times due to the COVID-19 pandemic and was drawing only S$4,000 a month and was self-employed.

Before that, he was a salaried partner at a law firm where a close relative of his was the managing director.

JUDGE'S FINDINGS

The judge said the woman could not continue to stay in the Tanglin unit for various reasons.

The couple had an acrimonious relationship, with the man calling his wife a ""prostitute"" and expecting her to have sex with him in exchange for maintenance.

Judge Thong said she saw no reason for the man to insist on living at the Tanglin unit, ""given that he was comfortably living at his mother’s house in Bukit Timah before their marital woes started, and he had his laundry and cooking done by the domestic helpers there with nary a complaint"".

Judge Thong said that the husband's ""rather nebulous concept"" of wifely duties ""not only had a whiff of chauvinism"" but was also ""measured by his yardstick"".

""If he is unhappy with his wife's behaviour and believes he has grounds to file for divorce, he is at liberty to do so; I make no comment on whether he would succeed,"" said the judge. ""But he cannot deny her maintenance on the sole basis that she has not acted in a manner that pleased him.""

Judge Thong added that it was ""rather rich"" of the husband to say his wife had failed to honour her covenant, as he had admitted to paying Russian women to perform for him in video calls.

""Under cross-examination, he replied in an indignant tone that these calls were not sexual in nature as one cannot have sex virtually – they were simply 'sexy' video calls. On another occasion, he insouciantly shrugged off as 'friendly' a text message that he sent to a former lover about wanting to get naked with someone,"" said the judge.

The wife had asked for monthly maintenance of S$8,500, but the judge found that S$6,092 was a reasonable figure instead.

She declined to order the man to pay allowance to his wife's parents.

Judge Thong found that the man had the means to support his wife, pointing to credit card bills that suggested he earned more than the S$4,000 he claimed.

The man has filed an appeal against the decision.","However, the lawyer stopped paying his wife maintenance from August 2021 and she resorted to borrowing money from her friends.

You might have seen International Women's Day mentioned in the media or heard friends talking about it.

But what is this day for? When is it? Is it a celebration or a protest? Is there an equivalent International Men's Day? And what events will take place this year?

For more than a century people around the world have been marking 8 March as a special day for women.

Read on to find out why.

1. How did it start?

Image source, Corbis / Hulton Deutsch Image caption, Clara Zetkin founded International Women's Day in 1910

International Women's Day, also known as IWD for short, grew out of the labour movement to become an annual event recognised by the United Nations.

The seeds were planted in 1908, when 15,000 women marched through New York demanding shorter working hours, better pay and the right to vote. A year later, the Socialist Party of America declared the first National Woman's Day.

It was Clara Zetkin, a communist activist and advocate for women's rights, who suggested the creation of an international day. She put her idea to an International Conference of Working Women in Copenhagen in 1910 - and the 100 women there, from 17 countries, agreed to it unanimously.

International Women's Day was first celebrated in 1911, in Austria, Denmark, Germany and Switzerland. The centenary was celebrated in 2011, so this year we're technically celebrating the 111th.

Things were made official in 1975 when the United Nations started celebrating the day. The first theme adopted (in 1996) was ""Celebrating the Past, Planning for the Future"".

International Women's Day has become a date to celebrate how far women have come in society, politics and in economics, while the political roots of the day mean strikes and protests are organised to raise awareness of continued inequality.

2. Why 8 March?

Clara's idea for an International Women's Day had no fixed date.

It wasn't formalised until a wartime strike in 1917, when Russian women demanded ""bread and peace""; four days into the strike the tsar was forced to abdicate and the provisional government granted women the right to vote.

The strike began on 8 March and this became the date that International Women's Day is celebrated.

3. Why do people wear the colour purple?

Purple, green and white are the colours of IWD, according to the International Women's Day website.

""Purple signifies justice and dignity. Green symbolises hope. White represents purity, albeit a controversial concept. The colours originated from the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) in the UK in 1908,"" they say.

4. Is there an International Men's Day?

There is indeed, on 19 November.

But it has only been marked since the 1990s and isn't recognised by the UN. People celebrate it in more than 80 countries worldwide, including the UK.

The day celebrates ""the positive value men bring to the world, their families and communities"", according to the organisers, and aims to highlight positive role models, raise awareness of men's well-being, and improve gender relations. The theme for 2021 was Better relations between men and women.

5. How is Women's Day celebrated, and will there be virtual events this year?

International Women's Day is a national holiday in many countries, including Russia, where flower sales double during the three or four days around 8 March.

In China, many women are given a half-day off work on 8 March, as advised by the State Council.

In Italy, International Women's Day, or la Festa della Donna, is celebrated by the giving of mimosa blossoms. The origin of this tradition is unclear but it is believed to have started in Rome after World War Two.

In the US, the month of March is Women's History Month. A presidential proclamation issued every year honours the achievements of American women.

This year, celebrations will continue to look a little different because of coronavirus and virtual events are expected to take place around the world, including this one organised by the UN.

6. What is the IWD 2022 theme?

The UN announced their theme for 2022 as ""Gender equality today for a sustainable tomorrow"". Their events will recognise how women around the world are responding to climate change.

But there are also other themes around. The International Women's Day website - which says it's designed to ""provide a platform to help forge positive change for women"" - has chosen the theme #BreakTheBias and is asking people to imagine ""a world free of bias, stereotypes, and discrimination"".

7. Why do we need it?

Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Women's groups in Mexico turned metal fencing into an impromptu memorial for victims of femicide

We have seen a significant step back in the global fight for women's rights over the past year. The resurgence of the Taliban in August changed the lives of millions of Afghan women - girls were banned from receiving secondary education, the ministry for women's affairs in the country was disbanded, and many women were told not to return to work.

In the UK, the murder of Sarah Everard by a serving police officer reignited debates around women's safety.

The coronavirus pandemic also continues to have an impact on women's rights. According to the World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap Report 2021, the time needed to close the global gender gap has increased by a generation from 99.5 years to 135.6 years.

Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Women take to the streets to celebrate - and protest

A 2021 study by UN Women based on 13 countries showed that almost one in two women (45%) reported that they or a woman they know experienced a form of violence during the Covid-19 pandemic. This includes non-physical abuse, with verbal abuse and the denial of basic resources being the most commonly reported.

Despite concerns over coronavirus, marches took place around the world for IWD 2021.

In Mexico, women's groups turned metal fencing, erected to protect the National Palace, into an impromptu memorial for the victims of femicides.

Meanwhile, women in Poland held protests across the country following the introduction of a near-total ban on abortion in January 2021.

In the past few years though, there has been progress - especially in female leadership.

Kamala Harris became the first female, first black and first Asian-American US vice-president in 2021.

In the same year, Tanzania swore in its first female president, Samia Suluhu Hassan, while Estonia, Sweden, Samoa and Tunisia got female prime ministers for the first time in history. In January 2022, Xiomara Castro was sworn in as Honduras' first female president.

In 2021, New Zealand approved paid bereavement leave for women (and their partners) who have a miscarriage or stillbirth. While in 2020, Sudan criminalised female genital mutilation.

And who can forget the impact of the #MeToo conversation, speaking out against experiences of harassment and sexual assault? It began back in 2017 but is now a global phenomenon. In January 2022, a university lecturer in Morocco was sentenced to two years in prison for indecent behaviour, sexual harassment and violence after university students broke their silence about demands he had made for sexual favours in return for good grades - a string of such scandals have tarnished the reputation of Moroccan universities in recent years.

The last year has seen developments regarding abortion in several countries. In February 2022, Colombia decriminalised abortions within the first 24 weeks of pregnancy. In the US, meanwhile, abortion rights have been restricted in some states, with Texas banning procedures from as early as six weeks into a pregnancy.

712,712,https://abcnews.go.com/US/ivermectin-condemned-experts-covid-19-treatment-continues-easily/story?id=83178790,"Ivermectin, condemned by experts as COVID-19 treatment, continues to be easily accessible through telemedicine","In the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, as hospitals became overrun, a group of doctors began touting an anti-parasitic medicine called ivermectin as a viable treatment for COVID-19, one going as far as calling it a ""miracle cure"" for the coronavirus, despite experts in the medical community urging caution and warning that science so far did not support its use in the treatment of COVID-19 outside of a clinical trial.

""There is a drug that is proving to be a miraculous impact, and when I say miracle, I do not use that term lightly,"" Dr. Pierre Kory, a critical care physician, said at a congressional hearing in December 2020. ""And I don't want to be sensationalized.""

Major health institutions like the FDA and CDC issued warnings urging against the use of ivermectin as a COVID-19 treatment, even as a group called the Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance, co-founded by Kory, and another group called America's Frontline Doctors, continued to promote the drug on their websites, on social media and at speaking engagements -- making ivermectin one of the most controversial topics related to the pandemic.

The drug, commonly used for livestock and pets in an animal-grade formula, is also FDA-approved in a human formula to treat parasitic infections and skin conditions such as scabies. In 2020, as the medical community was furiously looking for ways to treat coronavirus patients, and vaccines still seemed like a distant dream, a study in Australia suggested that ivermectin could ""stop the SARS-CoV-2 virus growing in cell culture"" in a laboratory.

Dr. Pierre Kory testifies before the Senate Homeland Security Committee in Washington, Dec. 2020. ABC News

But what happened in that test tube didn't prove that the drug could heal a person sick with COVID-19 or prevent COVID-19 in people, and the university website where the study is posted warns that ""whilst shown to be effective in the lab environment, ivermectin cannot be used in humans for COVID-19 until further testing and clinical trials have been completed to establish effectiveness of the drug.""

Ivermectin advocates often cite ""dozens"" of studies that show benefits of ivermectin in combating COVID-19, but a closer look at the studies shows that some of them have been retracted for flawed or fabricated data and analysis, while many randomized trials have shown no benefits. There have been some small studies that did suggest positive effects of ivermectin on treating COVID-19 patients, but no large, rigorous, randomized controlled trial has shown that ivermectin is effective at treating or preventing COVID-19, medical experts say.

The general consensus in the medical community now is that there's not enough data to recommend ivermectin for routine use as a COVID-19 treatment, said Dr. Adrian Hernandez, professor of medicine and vice dean and executive director of Duke Clinical Research Institute, who is leading a nationwide clinical trial on potential treatments for COVID-19. And doctors point out that there are side effect risks with any pharmaceuticals, so using the medication for unintended purposes may be dangerous.

And even with the arrival of highly effective treatments and vaccines, support for ivermectin has continued among some vaccine skeptics, including Kory, who have championed the drug as a COVID-19 cure and a key part of early treatment, and have urged Americans to stock up on it.

In August, prescriptions for ivermectin jumped to nearly 25 times the normal rate, to 88,000 per week, up from just 3,600 per week before the pandemic, according to the CDC.

""Let me just say very clearly that ivermectin is not a recommended treatment for COVID-19,"" U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said in August. ""It is not a recommended drug to prevent COVID-19.""

At your doorstep within days

Despite the warnings from health agencies about unproven COVID-19 treatments, several physicians groups have partnered with telemedicine platforms and pharmacies to offer easy access to drugs like ivermectin. But the easy access comes at a cost, with a telemedicine visit and the cost of the prescription typically ranging from $90-$300.

ABC News was able to obtain 28 pills of ivermectin for a total of $339, including a $90 telemedicine consultation fee and a charge of $249 from an online pharmacy -- which included a $25 shipping fee for overnight delivery -- after filling out an application and providing a medical history through a telemedicine platform, and having a brief conversation with someone who claimed to have no knowledge about the drug or COVID-19.

It was an unusual process for obtaining a medicine: Georgia-based ABC News Senior National Correspondent Steve Osunsami first spoke with a woman who said she was calling from Alabama and described herself as a technical nurse, while a Florida-based nurse practitioner -- who didn't speak with Osunsami but had a license to practice in Georgia -- sent the prescription for the pills to a New York pharmacy that then shipped the pills to Georgia.

Osunsami began the process by registering online, after which he was contacted by the woman in Alabama. ""Which one of the medications are you interested in?"" she asked Osunsami, who told her he was interested in ivermectin. The woman then asked him if he had high blood pressure or allergies, and took some additional information.

""All right, that's all the information I need,"" the woman said. ""So let's send this to the pharmacy.""

Asked if there was anything else to know about the drug, the woman directed Osunsami to the pharmacy that would fill his prescription.

""I don't have any medical knowledge as far as medicine or even about COVID,"" said the woman. ""I don't have any medical knowledge at all. I'm so sorry, but I really don't.""

But no matter, because the prescription was already on its way.

Osunsami was not asked if he wanted a consultation with a doctor or a pharmacist. He did receive some guidance including how to use the medicine and what side effects to look out for with the drug.

'Millions of dollars being made'

One year after his congressional testimony, Kory doubled down on the anti-parasitic drug, calling ivermectin the ""single greatest solution to the pandemic"" in a blog post earlier this month -- even though top health agencies have said ivermectin is not yet proven to be effective against the coronavirus.

And just days ago, Kory launched his own telemedicine platform that offers ivermectin as part of its treatment protocols. For $250, his website offers a 15-minute ""'Meds on Hand' Treatment Kit"" consultation with a nurse practitioner through text or telephone --- and for a premium of $950, you can even arrange a personalized visit with Kory himself. The website doesn't say whether the platform sends the drugs to a pharmacy or it sells them directly. It says ivermectin is part of their treatment protocol.

The website offers ivermectin and a few other drugs like hydroxychloroquine, a once-promising COVID-19 treatment that had its FDA emergency authorization revoked after it failed to show a benefit in large studies, as part of its COVID-19 treatment protocols.

Neither Kory, representatives for his new telemedicine platform, or members of the Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance responded to ABC News' multiple requests for comment regarding promoting the use of drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 that have not been proven to be effective treatments for the disease.

Critics say that at least one other group is capitalizing on the interest in ivermectin -- apparently by leveraging a network of doctors available to write the prescriptions.

ABC News obtained an email sent by Encore Telemedicine, an entity that was connecting patients to telemedicine services for people seeking consultation through the physicians group America's Frontline Doctors. In the email, Encore Telemedicine sought to entice physicians to ""become part of an ivermectin 'COVID-19 project'"" with the potential to receive ""tens of thousands of dollars per month"" from prescribing ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine.

""We can send you as many patients per day at $30 per patient per encounter as you would like,"" the email stated. ""We have physicians making tens of thousands of dollars per month.""

Neither Encore Telemedicine nor America's Frontline Doctors responded to ABC News' requests for comment. Encore Telemedicine's website has been down for several months.

The booming online industry of telemedicine offering unproven COVID-19 treatments like ivermectin has caught the attention of lawmakers, who have launched an investigation into America's Frontline Doctors and SpeakWithAnMD.com, a telemedicine platform.

In a letter sent by the House Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis to America's Frontline Doctors, House investigators refer to Encore Telemedicine, the company that ABC News obtained the email from, as the parent company of SpeakWithAnMD.com.

The House probe, launched in October, is investigating the entities for allegedly ""spreading misinformation and facilitating access to disproven and potentially hazardous coronavirus treatments, such as hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin.""

""Attempts to monetize coronavirus misinformation have eroded public confidence in proven treatments and prevention measures and hindered efforts to control the pandemic,"" Rep. James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.), chairman of the House Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, wrote in a letter to Dr. Simone Gold, the leader of America's Frontline Doctors, over the fall.

""We think there are millions of dollars being made by various groups selling misinformation,"" Clyburn told ABC News. ""[We're] doing what we think is necessary to try to get to the bottom of this.""","There have been some small studies that did suggest positive effects of ivermectin on treating COVID-19 patients, but no large, rigorous, randomized controlled trial has shown that ivermectin is effective at treating or preventing COVID-19, medical experts say.

The studies that have been done in fire stations, fire station dust and fire station air sampling have shown that we’ve taken all these products of combustion, all these heavy metals, all these know carcinogens, and brought them back to our place of employment. Trying to eliminate those unnecessary exposures are things we need to be cognizant of,” says McMillan.

And the science has changed over time with the development of firefighter PPE. Prior to the age of self-contained breathing apparatus, a lot of the exposures firefighters received from smoke were assumed to be inhalation exposures. As such, initial legislation presumptions reflected that with lung cancer and mesothelioma. However, McMillan says that what they find through modern research is that the dermal absorption of smoke and particulate aerosolized products and gases are a real risk.

In addition, recent studies from California show female firefighters are exposed to higher levels of certain PFAS chemicals, as compared to other workers, which are found within the foam that firefighters use, and the Bunker gear meant to protect them. There are a host of risks associated with PFAS exposure, not only are they carcinogens but they are endocrine-disrupting chemicals which are very bio persistent. Indeed, some PFAS chemicals can sometimes have a half life of nine years.","Trying to eliminate those unnecessary exposures are things we need to be cognizant of,” says McMillan.

In September, the Securities and Exchange Board of India authorised plans for India’s two largest stock exchanges, the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), to shorten their settlement cycle for listed equities to T+1 on a phased approach beginning on 25 February 2022.



The initiative would see India become the first market to accelerate its equities settlement cycle from T+2 to T+1.



In support of the anticipated accelerated market timelines, The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), who have been integral to moving the US equities markets to T+1, is working with India’s T+1 Industry Working Group (IWG) to promote broader adoption of its institutional trade processing's settlements management notifications functionality.



DTCC’s platform accelerates the process of communicating the matched economic details of a trade to local custodians throughout the trading day without having to wait till the close of trading.



In December 2021, DTCC released a report predicting that US securities are likely to move to next-day settlement during the first half of 2024.



In the report, DTCC, the Investment Company Institute and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association predicted that a transition from T+2 to T+1 settlement for the US in H1 2024 will give impacted firms sufficient time to assess the changes required, to conduct testing and for financial supervisors to implement the necessary regulatory amendments.



This will deliver T+1 settlement for US securities slightly less than a quarter of a century after moves to deliver this reduced settlement cycle, led by the Securities Industry Association, were “postponed” in July 2002.

715,715,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/great-resignation-60-minutes-2022-01-10/,The Great Resignation: Why more Americans are quitting their jobs than ever before,"Why are Americans choosing to quit their jobs in record numbers?

Why are so many Americans quitting their jobs?

Why are so many Americans quitting their jobs?

We've all seen signs in front of shops, restaurants, and factories: ""we're hiring!"" ""Help wanted!"" And now, the Omicron variant is taking a toll on the already depleted workforce. We've wondered how there can be so many open jobs when nearly every employer seems to be offering better pay, benefits and even signing bonuses.

The government's jobs report released this past week tells us what has happened: well over 20 million people quit their jobs in the second half of 2021. Some are calling it the ""big quit,"" others the ""great resignation.""

But who can explain why this is happening? We found the best place to look for real-time answers is the huge online job site LinkedIn, which calls itself the world's largest professional network.

Karin Kimbrough: People have been living to work for a very long time. And I think the pandemic brought that moment of reflection for everyone. ""What do I wanna do? What makes my heart sing?"" And people are thinking, ""If not now, then when?""

Karin Kimbrough is LinkedIn's chief economist. She has degrees from Stanford and Harvard and a Ph.D. from Oxford, used to work for the Federal Reserve, and now has a birds-eye view of the U.S. labor market.

Karin Kimbrough

Karin Kimbrough: We have this unique view of the data. We can see across millions of members and what they share with us, and we can see from employers, millions of them that are posting jobs on our platform. There is one person hired every 15 seconds right now on LinkedIn.

But LinkedIn's data on who is leaving jobs is most compelling: millions of baby boomers retiring early, but also millions of ""Gen Z"" workers - people in their teens and early 20s. Many more women than men. In all, the highest ""quit rate"" since the government started keeping track two decades ago.

Karin Kimbrough: At the nationwide level the number of Americans quitting their job is higher than ever.

Bill Whitaker: Higher than ever?

Karin Kimbrough: Higher than ever.

Bill Whitaker: Do the data tell you why?

Karin Kimbrough: We can see what sectors people are quitting. Retail sectors and hospitality sectors. It may not just be worth it for some folks. And so in some cases people are quitting and they're not yet returning. They're taking a break. Americans are burnt out. I like to think of it as-- it's a, ""Take this job and shove it,"" measure. It's just a sign of people saying, ""You know, I don't need this.""

Bill Whitaker: ""I'm out.""

Karin Kimbrough: ""I'm out.""

The most recent data show people quitting jobs across the board: 4.4% of all positions in education are open, over 6% in retail, and more than 8% in health care. Open jobs in hotels and restaurants are nearly 9%. That's almost a million-and-a-half vacant positions.

Carl Sobocinski: We do have openings, and we do need more employees.

Carl Sobocinski

Carl Sobocinski owns several restaurants in Greenville, South Carolina. He needs workers both in the kitchen and out front waiting tables.

Bill Whitaker: What's the biggest challenge in-- in attracting them and-- keeping the employees?

Carl Sobocinski: It's a problem that they're just not out there. Where we are, we just don't have the workers out there looking for the jobs.

Construction is another sector without enough workers; at last count there were nearly 350,000 open construction jobs nationwide.

Bill Whitaker: You're finding it more difficult to find people right now--

James Jordon: Absolutely.

Bill Whitaker: --across the board?

James Jordon: Across the board.

James Jordon owns a fast-growing construction company in Greenville.

James Jordon: We doubled our revenue year over year. We don't have a work problem at all, now it's just a matter of finding-- the individuals to be able to do-- perform the work.

Bill Whitaker: So it's not a work problem, it's a worker problem?

James Jordon: It's a worker problem.

James Jordon

We came to Greenville, South Carolina, after seeing it on a LinkedIn data map showing trends of geographic migration. Lots of workers leaving big cities like San Francisco and Chicago and lots of workers moving to places like Austin and Miami… and Greenville.

Bill Whitaker: That's another big sign of this job market. People are moving.

Karin Kimbrough: A lot of people are just opting because of affordable housing costs to choose more affordable places, smaller cities that give you more space, will feel safer. And people are willing to try something new.

For what you'd pay to rent an apartment in San Francisco, you can buy a nice house in Greenville. It has attracted big employers like BMW and Michelin, but also tries to nurture small businesses and start-ups.

Still, you see all the same ""help wanted"" signs on Greenville's main street as you would in any big city. Many people believe that generous government stimulus and unemployment benefits are really what's keeping so many workers on the sidelines, no matter where they live.

Carl Sobocinski: The quick answer people say is we're still providing too many benefits, and too many people can sit at home and-- and get a check. I personally disagree with that. Our associates that didn't come back, They're not sitting at home. They found other careers, other opportunities, that fit their lifestyle better.

Karin Kimbrough: What we saw was that when these benefits were turned off, when workers were no longer getting the benefits, they did not rush back to work.

Bill Whitaker: What does that tell you?

Karin Kimbrough: That tells me that it's not just a function of the benefits. That's not the only thing that's going on in the heads of workers when they make that calculus about, ""Should I go back? Will I go back, and f-- for what job?""

Bill Whitaker: So is all of this producing-- a fundamental shift in the balance of power between employers and employees?

Karin Kimbrough: It's as if that social contract of work is being rewritten, and right now the worker's holding the pen. There are just thousands upon thousands of available jobs in America right now. And companies are eager to hire. But workers are being very choosy.

Bill Whitaker: So employees are kind of in the driver's seat?

Karin Kimbrough: Employees are in the driver's seat right now.

Workers want better pay and benefits, of course, but they're also demanding autonomy and flexibility, particularly in their work schedules. And employers – large and small - simply have to respond.

Carl Sobocinski: I think flexibility's critical.

Bill Whitaker: This is the employees' demand.

Carl Sobocinski: The employees, they want flexibility. And if you're an employer that won't-- that won't work with your employees to-- to be flexible with them, then you're gonna be-- you're missing out. I mean, you have to.

Bill Whitaker: So is it the case that gone are the days where an employer would say, ""You're just lucky to have this job""?

James Jordon: I-- I think so. I think so, and I think it's for the better.

James Jordon's construction company will pay an employee's tuition if they want to continue their education and their moving expenses if they relocate. And like so many employers, he's offering signing bonuses and flexible hours to new hires.

Bill Whitaker: I understand there was one young man, one young recruit that you called every day for two months?

James Jordon: I did (LAUGH).

Bill Whitaker: (LAUGH) You really wanted this young man--

James Jordon: I did. I did.

Bill Whitaker: Did you finally get him?

James Jordon: I finally got him. He started last week, Monday.

What a stunning turnaround from the spring of 2020, when the pandemic essentially shut the economy down.

Karin Kimbrough: We had never seen anything like it. When you lose 22 million jobs in just two months -- and it's unthinkable.

Kimbrough remembers that working mothers were, and still are, among those hardest hit, as the pandemic robbed them of many of their child-care options.

Karin Kimbrough: What we're seeing now is actually a really great story of resilience. Because we're seeing more and more women come back into the workforce. We're still missing a few million women, by the way, in the workforce. We're not fully there.

Bill Whitaker: Still?

Karin Kimbrough: Still missing a few million women. But we're seeing them come back. And predominantly the women that were missing are parents of young children. They were hit the hardest.

Melissa Williams

Melissa Williams: I just decided to leave. I had nowhere to go. I had no hopes for employment. Luckily, my husband was gainfully employed and I was able to do that. But I just walked away.

Melissa Williams walked away from a marketing job in Greenville in early 2021. When the pandemic hit, she was balancing marriage, motherhood, and her career.

Bill Whitaker: You know, you're part of-- a trend.

Melissa Williams: Yes.

Bill Whitaker: There's, like, a fundamental shift--

Melissa Williams: The great resignation. (LAUGH)

Bill Whitaker: People who are saying and doing what you did. ""I-- I-- I can do better than this. This isn't-- this isn't fun. This isn't me.""

Melissa Williams: Like you said, I hit a wall and I was done.

Bill Whitaker: Was that difficult? I mean…

Melissa Williams: It was. It was very scary. 'Cause I had-- I've been employed since I was 17 years old. I remember going home after I put in my resignation and-- and I just sat there on the couch and I was like, ""What did I just do? I just quit my job. I have no job to go to. We have bills. We have a child. We have responsibilities."" And my husband's like, ""You wanna go for a walk?"" It's like, ""Well, I don't have anything else to do."" (LAUGH) So we went for a walk. (LAUGH)

Kenzie Biggins: It is challenging to go say ""I'm gonna go out on my own,"" in general. It really does take some work. But people wanna have control.

Kenzie Biggins

Kenzie Biggins moved to Greenville in 2017, a few years after she founded ""Worxbee,"" which pairs remote assistants with executives and companies that need administrative help.

Bill Whitaker: You find executive assistants all over the country and you team them up with executives and companies also all over the country?

Kenzie Biggins: Yes.

Bill Whitaker: So one can be in Greenville and an executive can be in Chicago.

Kenzie Biggins: Yeah. It's all about the best pairing for you.

Kenzie had the idea for Worxbee years before the pandemic made such arrangements common.

Bill Whitaker: You were ahead of the curve, and then the curve caught up. (LAUGH)

Kenzie Biggins: Let me just say this, I got a lotta crazy looks for a very long time, you know, walking into places and saying, ""You should have a virtual executive assistant."" People looked at me like I had five heads. They were, like, ""What?""

Bill Whitaker: Pandemic hits and all of a sudden, you're a genius.

Kenzie Biggins: We went from closing three to four people a month, to closing ten to 18 people per month, which is quite the jump, (LAUGH) in trying to get people paired, and bring in new EAs.

Karin Kimbrough: Americans have really taken a liking to remote work. They're two and a half times as likely to apply to a job that's remote versus a job that's not remote.

Bill Whitaker: How's that different from pre-pandemic?

Karin Kimbrough: So pre-pandemic I think one in every 67 jobs was a remote job.

Bill Whitaker: And now?

Karin Kimbrough: And now it's one in seven.

Bill Whitaker: One in seven?

Karin Kimbrough: One in seven jobs is remote now. It's huge--

Bill Whitaker: That's a huge shift

Karin Kimbrough: Huge rise in m-- and I think what it is, is that companies have realized that if they want to attract candidates they kinda need to meet them where they are now.

Melissa Williams: Worxbee found me at the most opportune time.

Two months after quitting her office job, Melissa started with Worxbee. She's now an executive assistant for three organizations.

Bill Whitaker: You're working for three different bosses--

Melissa Williams: Yes. Uh-huh (AFFIRM).

Bill Whitaker: From home.

Melissa Williams: Uh-huh (AFFIRM).

Bill Whitaker: All virtually.

Melissa Williams: Yes.

Bill Whitaker: It sounds like you could be just as busy as you were before.

Melissa Williams: I am. I am just as busy. The difference is, it's my choice.

Bill Whitaker: Now you have a fourth job?

Melissa Williams: I do. (LAUGH) I do. I am also an English instructor at Greenville Technical College.

Bill Whitaker: Worxbee and the ability to design your work life, does that make it possible for you to now enjoy what seems to be your passion?

Melissa Williams: Absolutely.

Bill Whitaker: To teach English.

Melissa Williams: Absolutely. If it had not been for Worxbee, I would have never been able to even give this a shot.

The pendulum of power may soon swing back toward employers, especially as workers who've quit their jobs deplete their savings. But Karin Kimbrough expects employees to cling to the flexibility they've fought for.

Karin Kimbrough: I think actually that this trend towards having more flexibility could be permanent.

Melissa Williams: I honestly can say I don't see myself going back to an office ever. And that--

Bill Whitaker: Ever--

Melissa Williams: Ever. Honestly, there is no office that could offer me what I have in my house. It's just not possible.

The officials declined to elaborate on whether China agreed to the request, or whether the U.S. even knows the answer to that question. They declined say what kind of equipment was requested, and whether it was lethal.

News of the request was first reported by the Financial Times.

U.S. concerns about Russia’s request were expected to be a key issue when President Joe Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, meets Monday in Rome with China’s senior diplomat, Yang Jiechi. The White House announced that meeting earlier Sunday.

Russia’s Embassy in Washington didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Liu Pengyu, spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, said he had not heard about the request.

""China is deeply concerned and grieved on the Ukraine situation,"" he added. ""We sincerely hope that the situation will ease and peace will return at an early date.”

The White House had no comment.

Earlier Sunday on NBC News' ""Meet the Press,"" Sullivan warned non-allies against aiding Russia's war effort, and he singled out China.

“We have made it clear to not just Beijing, but every country in the world, that if they think that they can basically bail Russia out, they can give Russia a workaround to the sanctions that we’ve imposed, they should have another thing coming,"" he said. He added:

""We will ensure that neither China, nor anyone else, can compensate Russia for these losses.""

The news came as at least 35 people were killed and 134 others were injured when a Russian airstrike hit a military base in western Ukraine about 20 miles from the Polish border, Ukrainian officials said Sunday.

“The airstrike was carried out from the Black and Azov seas,” Lviv regional administration head Maksym Kozytskiy said in a Telegram post, which confirmed the number of dead and injured. He added that around 30 missiles had hit the International Center for Peacekeeping and Security in Yavoriv.

NBC News has not independently verified the number of those killed or injured or the missile strikes.

Kozytskiy added an appeal to NATO to create a no-fly zone over Ukraine and to provide military planes. NATO countries, including the United States, have not done so because of concerns that the moves could seriously escalate the conflict with Russia.

“Now that the shelling is approaching the borders of NATO countries, this is the crucial moment,” Kozytskiy said.

The attack came after Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, suggested Saturday that Russian forces could try to destroy foreign shipments of weapons to Ukraine, calling them “legitimate targets.”

The International Center for Peacekeeping and Security regularly hosts American, Canadian and other international instructors who help train the Ukrainian military.

The base is west of the city of Lviv, where thousands have fled amid heavy attacks in the eastern part of the country. Military supply groups told NBC News last week that the six-hour drive from Kyiv to Lviv now takes about a day’s time.

Both Lviv and other cities along the Polish border have been crucial in allowing for the influx of supplies that allow the Ukrainian military to keep up its fight against Russia.

Russia has continued to expand its military offensive west, with airstrikes Friday on the cities of Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk.

While the country has said it was not targeting civilians, the U.N. Human Rights office said at least 579 civilians had been killed, including 42 children, as of Friday. Another 1,002 civilians were injured, the agency reported.

Analysis shows that the force includes landing ships.

Russian Navy ships can be seen in satellite imagery approaching the Ukrainian Coast. The Sentinel 2 satellite image, taken at 11:47 local time, shows at least 14 vessels.



The vessels were found by Naval News with the help of Damien Symon, an independent defense analyst. Preliminary analysis of the vessels suggests 3 groups. Two are made up of combatants, and one has several landing ships. The landing ships appear to have sailed directly from their staging position off the Crimean coast. Analysts are searching the imagery for more vessels.



Provisional identification of the ships

The northern group, in a line-astern formation, appears to be led by a tug boat or minesweeper. This vessel appears to be towing a mine clearing device. Behind it are two Ropucha class landing ships, another tug boat and a trailing Ropucha.

The second group, labelled Group 2 on the graphic, are in a square formation. These appear to be smaller warships such as missile corvettes.

The southern group, labelled Group 1, is led by the Slava Class cruiser Moskva. This appears to have two Alligator class landing ships, and the Ivan Gren class landing ship Pyotr Morgunov. There is also a smaller warship, possibly a Buyan-M class missile corvette.

Opposed Landing

While Russian warships have sailed close to Odessa during the conflict so far, this appears to be a landing force. A landing had long been speculated on, and there is credible evidence that it was planned. Previously the Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko has shown plans for an amphibious landing near Odessa. That was an apparent intelligence blunder as no landings occurred in the following days. However the threat was always present.



On March 14 a Russian convoy landed at Berdyansk on the opposite side of the Ukrainian coast. That action, on the Sea of Azov, followed Russian success on the land there and was unopposed. This is different however.

Any landing is likely to opposed. At the time of writing it is unclear whether the landing has taken place yet, or exactly where the vessels will target.","Russian Navy Landing Ships Seen Approaching Ukrainian Coast Near Odessa The Russian Navy is advancing on the Odessa region of Ukraine.

722,722,https://www.healthline.com/health/butterfly-skin,Butterfly Skin Disease (Epidermolysis Bullosa): A Rare Disorder,"What is butterfly skin disease? Epidermolysis bullosa is a rare skin condition that’s usually inherited. It makes the skin incredibly thin and brittle. People born with this condition are often called “butterfly children” because their skin is as delicate as a butterfly’s wings. Living with epidermolysis bullosa can be difficult, and it begins at birth for most. There’s no cure for this condition, but there are a lot of treatment options. How successful treatment is depends a lot on the severity of the condition, and how many areas of the body are affected.

What are the symptoms of epidermolysis bullosa Fragile skin that blisters and tears is common in all types of epidermolysis bullosa. Pain and itching commonly come with the blisters and tears. There are some subgroups of the condition and variations from person to person that can cause additional symptoms, too. These include: thick skin on the palms of your hands or soles of your feet

rough or thick fingernails or toenails

changes in skin color or tone

scarring and tightening of the skin

blisters inside your mouth

scarring or tightening of other tissues inside your body

Types of butterfly skin disease There are many types of epidermolysis bullosa. They are classified by what caused it and what parts of your body are affected. Most forms of this condition are caused by a genetic mutation inherited from one or both parents that affects how proteins in your skin are made. Forms of epidermolysis bullosa that have a genetic cause are divided into four subgroups. These are: epidermolysis bullosa simplex

junctional epidermolysis bullosa

dystrophicv epidermolysis bullosa

Kindler syndrome There’s another category of epidermolysis bullosa that isn’t caused by a genetic mutation. Instead, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita develops as an autoimmune disorder. Epidermolysis bullosa simplex This is the most common form of epidermolysis, but it’s still very rare, affecting between 1 in 30,000 to 1 in 50,000 people. It usually begins at birth or in early childhood, but can develop in the adult years, too. Blistering may improve with age in some people with this subgroup of the condition. In mild cases, blistering is usually limited to the hands and feet. With more severe forms, more parts of the body can be affected. Discolored or mottled skin is also common to this form of epidermolysis bullosa. Junctional epidermolysis bullosa This is one of the more severe forms of the condition. It affects about 3 per million people and can begin at birth or in early childhood. Junctional epidermolysis bullosa causes blistering over large areas of the body and can affect mucous membranes, like the lining of the mouth and even internal organs. When it impacts organs like the intestines, it can cause digestion and nutrition problems. As these blisters heal and scar repeatedly, they form a layer of skin called granulation tissue. This red, bumpy layer of skin bleeds heavily and easily. This can lead to infection and dehydration or even cause breathing problems if it develops in the mouth or airways. Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa Dystrophic epidermolysis develops in about 3.3 per 1 million people, usually in response to an injury or friction from rubbing or scratching. The hands, feet, and elbows are most often affected, but blisters can also appear across the entire body. When these blisters form in the mouth or digestive tract, scars form as they heal. This scarring can cause chewing and swallowing problems that lead to malnutrition and slowed growth. Scarring can happen in other parts of the body, too, and ongoing scarring in areas across the body can cause: skin to fuse between the fingers and toes

loss of fingernails or toenails

joint deformities

restricted movement

eye inflammation

vision loss

increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma When this type is present at birth, babies can be born with widespread blisters and even areas of missing skin from the birthing process. Kindler syndrome Kindler syndrome is a type of epidermolysis bullosa that usually begins at birth or in infancy but lessens with time. Blisters usually form on the backs of the hands and the tops of the feet. Over time, scarring in these areas can fuse fingers and toes together or give the skin a thin, papery texture. With this form, you may also have symptoms like: patchy skin discoloration

clusters of blood vessels that appear under the skin

a combination of both of the above symptoms (poikiloderma)

thickened skin on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet

sensitivity to sunlight and ultraviolet rays Kindler syndrome is a very rare form of this disease, with only about 250 cases reported worldwide. Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita Unlike other types of epidermolysis bullosa that are caused by genetic mutations, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita is an autoimmune condition that usually develops in adulthood, typically in the 30s or 40s. In the typical form of this disease, only “traumatized” skin that’s injured is affected with symptoms like: tight blood- or pus-filled blisters on the hands, knees, knuckles, elbows, and ankles

blisters on the mucous membranes that burst easily

scarring the formation of white spots called milia as blisters heal There’s also a generalized inflammatory type of this group of epidermolysis, and it can cause: widespread blisters that don’t focus on injured areas of skin

generalized redness and itching of the skin

minimal scarring as the blisters heal The type of presentation you have with this condition can vary over time.

What causes EB disease? Gene mutations are the cause of most forms of butterfly skin disease, but there are different gene mutations that are common to each subgroup. Epidermolysis bullosa simplex This is commonly caused by mutations in genes that make keratin proteins. These proteins give strength and resiliency to the outer layer of your skin, and a lack of it makes you vulnerable to friction and minor irritations. There’s another gene mutation that causes a more rare form of epidermolysis bullosa simplex called Ogna type. This subgroup is caused by a mutation in the gene that creates a protein called plectin. Plectin helps attach the top layer of your skin — the epidermis — to the layers beneath it. Junctional epidermolysis bullosa The genes that are mutated in this form of the disease typically are the ones that make a protein called Iaminin and certain collagens. Laminin helps strengthen skin and attach it to the top layers. Problems with the development of this protein can cause the layers of the skin to separate. When the mutation affects genes that produce collagens, it can impair the strength of the tissues that connect your body, like tendons and ligaments. Skin that lacks collagen can also lack strength and flexibility. Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa One gene, in particular, causes this type of epidermolysis bullosa, and that’s the gene that makes type VII collagen. This collagen strengthens and supports connective tissues, which are like the glue that holds your body together. Without these collagens, skin, ligaments, and other tissues become weakened. Kindler syndrome With Kindler syndrome, the gene mutation affects a protein that’s found in epithelial cells. These cells line the surfaces and inner cavities of the body and are crucial to cell movement and function. Who inherits what? To understand your chances of inheriting different types of this condition, you have to understand how genes are passed from parent to child. If only one set of a mutated gene is needed to cause a condition, it’s called autosomal dominant and each child has a 50-percent chance of inheriting this gene from their parents. If two sets of a gene mutation — one from each parent — is needed to cause a problem, these conditions are called autosomal recessive. This type of mutation is usually passed on by parents who have no symptoms of the disease themselves. Two carriers have a 25 percent chance of passing a symptomatic form of a condition on to their child, and a 50 percent chance of having a child who’s also a carrier. Autosomal dominant forms of epidermolysis bullosa include the simplex and dystrophic types. Dystrophic, junctional, and Kindler syndrome types are usually autosomal recessive. Was this helpful? Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita The underlying cause of this type of the disease is not genetic, but remains unknown. It’s believed that immune cells target certain types of collagens in this form of epidermolysis.

How is the condition diagnosed? Since many forms of this disease are genetic, diagnosis usually beings with a family history. A visual inspection of the skin may also be enough to make a diagnosis. But in most cases, a skin biopsy might be done so that your doctor can examine a sample of your skin closely under a microscope. In the case of epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, blood testing to check inflammation levels and antibodies may be helpful in making a diagnosis.

Caring for yourself or someone with butterfly skin disease at home Many caregivers of people with this condition are parents caring for their children. Wound care can be the most difficult aspect of care to learn, but it gets easier with time and practice. You may also be qualified to use an at-home wound care nurse or visit a specialty wound care center. Proper wound care is critical to promote good healing and prevent scar tissue, as well as to head off complications like infection. You can also increase comfort in someone with epidermolysis bullosa by: using dressings and padding to protect the skin from injury

applying aluminum chloride 20 percent to palms and soles to prevent the formation of blisters

using creams to soften skin and prevent thickening

nutritional support when there’s digestive involvement

keeping skin moist and covered

draining blisters

watching for early signs of infection

Prognosis For many people with epidermolysis, the disease begins in infancy but can become less severe over time. Pain and inflammation can be difficult to bear, but the prognosis isn’t always as bad as the symptoms. In mild cases, you can find therapies and medications that keep the disease under control. In more severe cases where internal organs are involved, the prognosis can become worse. Mucous membranes and body tissues that become stiff with scars or airways that are blocked by scar tissue can lead to serious or fatal complications. Early diagnosis and aggressive management of these chronic conditions are key.","Epidermolysis bullosa is a rare skin condition that’s usually inherited.

725,725,https://www.eco-business.com/news/incomes-dip-for-south-asias-women-home-workers-as-heat-rises/,Incomes dip for South Asia's women home workers as heat rises,"Rising heat and heavier rains across South Asia, as the planet warms, are forcing home-based women workers to cut down on hours as their houses get hotter or are flooded often, resulting in a loss of income they cannot afford, researchers said on Thursday.

In a survey of 202 women in cities across India, Nepal and Bangladesh, more than 40 per cent said they were spending less time on their informal jobs and earning less, found HomeNet South Asia, a regional network of groups representing home-based workers.

Across South Asia, women home workers make up nearly a quarter of total female employment, as against only 6 per cent for men, HomeNet said in a report, adding “home (based) work is one of the most vulnerable and lowest-paid types of work”.

Higher summer temperatures have directly impacted afternoon productivity, with some women reporting a 30 per cent drop in what they make, from food to clothing, according to the report.

“Living in a semi-pucca house (hut) with a tin roof, it becomes so hot inside that working in the afternoon is very difficult in summer,” said Goma Darji, a garment worker from Nepal who was cited in the report.

“If I use the fan, the electricity bill goes up, which I can’t afford,” she added.

Mamtaben, an Indian street-food vendor, has also seen her income shrink as heat and unseasonal rains reduce the length of time she can hawk her wares.

“Because the weather is so hot, all the food prepared gets spoilt and wasted if we don’t sell it the same day,” Mamtaben was quoted as saying in the report, which examined the impact of climate change on home-based workers.

“In addition, nowadays, there is rainfall at any time of the year and any time of the day. When it rains, people don’t come out to have street food … when we don’t meet our expected sales, we have to bear the loss,” she said.

The women — who largely live in urban slums — can ill afford this dip in production and income, with daily earnings for most already below the international poverty threshold of $1.90 per person per day, the report noted.

It also flagged growing hours of unpaid care-work that have led to a dip in paid work, with increasing cases of heat-stroke and water-borne diseases affecting families.

In the past decade, South Asia has seen more frequent and extreme weather — from droughts and floods to heatwaves and hailstorms — with two-thirds of HomeNet survey respondents believing these were “acts of God”.

Amid a lack of awareness and measures to help them deal with climate change impacts, most of these “invisible” women workers are using negative coping strategies, including moving home or giving up their livelihoods, the report noted.

Lead researcher Dharmistha Chauhan told the Thomson Reuters Foundation such women are part of global supply chains and there is an urgent need for companies to start investing in them.

“They need support for re-skilling and help to become climate-resilient,” she said.

“Most assume there is nothing they can do to combat climate change, which they identify by the increase in the number of heavy rain days or prolonged high temperatures.”

The report proposes using heat-resistant building materials and energy-efficient household appliances, and improving access to drinking water, as well as offering social security and financial assistance to upgrade homes.

726,726,https://www.evaluate.com/vantage/articles/interviews/novo-makes-rare-disease-push,Novo makes a rare disease push,"The pipelines of some of these therapy areas, such as lysosomal storage diseases, are crowded with gene therapy projects, but Mr Helfgott plays down Novo’s interest in such technology. “We believe gene editing is more attractive for patients than gene therapy, because it’s more durable.”

To this end, Novo signed a deal in 2019 with Bluebird Bio over an in vivo gene editing asset in haemophilia A; this is now being developed in partnership with the Bluebird spinout 2seventy bio and is “progressing well”, according to Mr Helfgott. However, 2seventy is otherwise focused on oncology, so it seems strange that this project did not stay with Bluebird.

Another “huge area of interest” for Novo is sickle cell disease, where it has an under-the-radar asset, known as Eclipse, about to go into phase 2. Mr Helfgott says the project, licensed from Epidestiny in 2018, it is an oral, fixed-dose formulation of decitabine and tetrahydrouridine, which is designed to deplete DNA methyltransferase 1 and thereby increase levels of foetal haemoglobin – various other sickle cell hopefuls are also working on boosting HbF (A big year for sickle cell, February 28, 2022).

He adds that Novo is investigating “several paths” in sickle cell, as he believes that “not one single drug will be the magic bullet”.

Growth hormone deficiency

For now, though, the main focus for Novo’s rare disease unit – formerly known as “biopharm” – is growth hormone deficiency and haemophilia. The Danish group sells several products here, including the daily growth hormone injection Norditropin and the recombinant FVII NovoSeven.

Several more could reach the market in the next couple of years. At the front of the pack is the once-weekly growth hormone Sogroya, which is already approved in adults and could soon have a shot at the more lucrative paediatrics market.

At the capital markets day last week Novo reported data from the phase 3 Real 4 trial in children, with Sogroya showing noninferiority to Norditropin on the primary endpoint, height velocity at one year. Regulatory filings are planned for the second quarter, but will noninferiority be enough, given that Ascendis’s Skytrofa has shown superiority to daily injections?

“In growth hormone deficiency, regulators are extremely sensitive to the trade-off of efficacy versus safety,” Mr Helfgott replies. “What we aimed at, from the beginning, was noninferiority to the daily drug. And that’s what we got.”

He adds that, if Sogroya does get the nod in children, other factors – such as the ease of use of the injector – could come into play; Novo’s existing presence in the field might also help. Skytrofa’s launch has disappointed so far, and Pfizer/Opko’s rival weekly project somatrogon was recently knocked back by the FDA, so there is still all to play for here.

Haemophilia

In haemophilia Novo’s next big hope is concizumab. The group reckons the project could be a universal therapy, encompassing patients with the A and B form of the disease and those with and without inhibitors – echoing Sanofi’s aim with fitusiran.

Last week Novo presented efficacy data from the phase 3 Explorer 7 trial in patients with inhibitors: the estimated mean annualised bleeding rate with concizumab prophylaxis was 1.7, versus 11.8 with on-demand therapy, and 64% of patients on concizumab had no bleeds. This puts concizumab about on par with fitusiran, according to data on the latter presented at last year’s Ash meeting, with the usual caveats about cross-trial comparisons.

However, the problem with fitusiran is not efficacy, but toxicity: Sanofi’s antithrombin inhibitor has been linked with blood clots and is now being tested at a lower dose.

Concizumab has a different mechanism of action, being a tissue factor pathway inhibitor, which should help it avoid this issue, Mr Helfgott says. Novo is not saying much about concizumab’s safety profile in Explorer 7, but more details will emerge later this year. The project is also in Explorer 8, a phase 3 study in patients without inhibitors that completes in May.

Dicerna deal

Novo’s late-stage rare disease pipeline is rounded out by the RNAi asset nedosiran, which the group gained through the recent $3.3bn purchase of Dicerna. Novo plans a regulatory filing by mid-year in primary hyperoxaluria 1 – nedosiran showed no effect in patients with the PH2 subtype – seemingly making the acquisition an exception to Novo’s early-stage pledge.

But Mr Helfgott says: “The main purpose of the deal was not so much the asset; it was really the platform and knowledge.” Novo has plans for RNAi, including delivering it outside the liver, and last week cited fat cells as an area of interest.

Mr Helfgott is adamant that Novo’s renewed push into rare diseases is not down to pessimism around its core diabetes and obesity franchises. He believes that the group’s primary care business can sit happily alongside an expanded rare disease offering. Now Novo just needs to prove that it can effectively target rare and common disorders alike.

One of the hallmarks of Parkinson’s disease is a buildup of degraded proteins in brain synapses that may eventually create areas of dead neurons.

The study in Drosophila, fruit flies, found that a surge of calcium in healthy brain synapses initiates the cleaning process by triggering a protein responsible for cells that discard the debris.

However, when a gene mutation already associated with Parkinson’s is present, the protein does not respond properly to calcium’s signal, and synaptic cleanup fails to occur. A gene mutation associated with Parkinson’s disease interrupts brain cells’ normal process for disposing of degraded proteins, according to a recent study. The result is a buildup of debris in synapses that may cause Parkinson’s symptoms. In a study of Drosophila, fruit flies, researchers demonstrated that the release of calcium in neurons triggers autophagy — cell house-cleaning — and that the gene mutation inhibits this release. Abnormal clumps of proteins called Lewy bodies, consisting primarily of clumps of the protein alpha-synuclein , are found in the synapses of people with Parkinson’s disease. Alpha-synuclein is normally involved in the cross-talk between brain cells. However, as misfolded alpha-synuclein proteins clump together, they kill neurons, leaving dead brain cells in their wake. According to Biogen’s Dr. Warren D. Hirst, the hypothesis that a failure in autophagy results in Parkinson’s is not new. However, the new study documents, step-by-step, the possible players and mechanics behind autophagy’s failure. (Dr. Hirst was not involved in the study.) The research is published in Neuron .

Parkinson’s disease: Things to know Parkinson’s disease is the second-most frequently diagnosed neurodegenerative disease, following Alzheimer’s disease. There are nearly one million people in the United States living with Parkinson’s, and the number is expected to rise to 1.2 million by 2030. About 10 million people have Parkinson’s worldwide. Almost 90,000 new cases are diagnosed each year in the U.S. In its advanced stages, critical dopamine-producing neurons in the brain’s basal ganglia die. This brain region controls movement. The main symptoms of Parkinson’s are: a tremor in the hands, head, arms, jaw, or legs

slow movement

stiff muscles that remain contracted for an extended period of time

impaired coordination and balance, with a potential for falling Parkinson’s may also cause depression and other emotional changes, skin problems, urinary issues, constipation, and difficulty swallowing, chewing, and talking. Most people diagnosed with Parkinson’s are over age 60, though about 5% may develop the disease earlier. It is not entirely clear the degree to which the disease may be inherited. It’s important to note that the condition affects people differently — some may experience more severe symptoms such as losing all mobility, while others may continue to experience mild symptoms. There is no cure for Parkinson’s disease, but treatment options such as medications, deep brain stimulation (DBS), and therapies, can help ease the symptoms. Increasing evidence from existing research also suggests that a nutritious diet and regular exercise can help prevent and manage the condition and other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s. A recent study found that just 6 minutes of high intensity exercise may help delay the onset of Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases by increasing the amount of neuroprotective brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the body.

Calcium, autophagy, and Parkinson’s risk Neurologist Dr. Santosh Kesari, who was also not involved in the study, described it as “a basic mechanistic paper taking a mutation that’s known to increase the risk of Parkinson’s, and testing what that mutation does in a fruit-fly model of Drosophila.” The researchers found that in Drosophila, an influx of calcium at brain synapses was the initial indirect, initiator of autophagy. They also determined that such synaptic calcium surges can be triggered by neuronal activity, or by starving cells of amino acids. “The authors provide substantial evidence supporting a role for calcium in the initiation of autophagy within Drosophila synapses,” said Associate Professor of Neurology Ian Martin, also not involved in the study. In particular, Asst. Prof. Martin noted, “The idea that synaptic autophagy could be coupled to neuronal activity, and that this autophagy is required for neuronal survival is generally well-supported in the study by an array of approaches, including biochemistry, genetics, synaptic physiology, and microscopy.” Dr. Kesari described autophagy: “It’s the trash disposal for the cell.”

Parkinson’s disease and EndoA The study next demonstrated that the link between calcium and autophagy is a Parkinson’s-associated mutation in the protein Endophilin-A, abbreviated as “EndoA.” EndoA is part of the endolysosomal system that other studies implicate as a potential early pathomechanism leading to alpha-synuclein clumps and Parkinson’s. The calcium influx normally makes EndoA more flexible, making it available for the formation of the autophagosomes that drive autophagy. The study found, however, that with the Parkinson’s-related mutation, the influx of calcium causes EndoA to stiffen, and this rigidity blocks the formation of autophagosomes, and therefore autophagy. The new study is thus unique in two ways: its focus on autophagy specifically at synaptic terminals, and its demonstration that the Parkinson’s-related gene mutation blocks its initiation. Together, these insights advance the understanding of how the disease works.","Share on Pinterest LuisPortugal/Getty Images According to a recent study, Parkinson’s disease may result from a failure of neuronal cells’ normal house-cleaning function.

Adults aged ≥70 living in high income countries and regions with better healthcare access and quality were found to experience the highest life expectancy and healthy life expectancy. Disability burden, however, remained constant, suggesting the need to enhance public health and intervention programmes to improve wellbeing among older adults.

Results Globally the population of older adults has increased since 1990 and all cause death rates have decreased for men and women. However, mortality rates due to falls increased between 1990 and 2019. The probability of death among people aged 70-90 decreased, mainly because of reductions in non-communicable diseases. Globally disability burden was largely driven by functional decline, vision and hearing loss, and symptoms of pain. LE-70 and HALE-70 showed continuous increases since 1990 globally, with certain regional disparities. Globally higher LE-70 resulted in higher HALE-70 and slightly increased PYIH-70. Sociodemographic and healthcare access and quality indices were positively correlated with HALE-70 and LE-70. For high exposure risk factors, data coverage was moderate, while limited data were available for various dietary, environmental or occupational, and metabolic risks.

Introduction

For the first time in history, most newborns might live into their 70s and beyond.1 With the global population experiencing extra years of life, the health and wellbeing of older adults is paramount so that they can continue to be actively engaged in society.2 However, if added years are spent in poor health, health systems will face increased healthcare expenses due to increased demand.3 To conceptualise years of life spent in good health, a variety of ageing indicators have been developed. Healthy and successful ageing, and frailty, project high or low wellbeing in older people, respectively.456 Ageing research suggests that functional decline and health loss are more reflective of healthy ageing than chronological age.7 Consequently, surveillance of the older population’s health is essential to capture its ageing status. Variations in the definition of old age exist that account for chronological age or for remaining life expectancy.8 Epidemiological data indicate that population ageing patterns are changing, with people aged ≥70 and ≥90 being the fastest growing segment in Europe, Asia, and the United States.91011 In 1950, older adults represented 5% of the global population; this estimate is projected to rise to 16% by 2050.12 Consequently, the health and wellbeing of ageing populations have become important public health issues with wide reaching economic implications that affect medical care, in-home care and assistance, and healthcare staff.13

The projected ageing demographics are linked to increased burden and duration of non-communicable diseases.7 An analysis of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2010 data established that the major causes of disability for adults aged ≥60 were musculoskeletal disorders, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and neurological disorders.14 In 2015, the World Health Organization declared that the rise in chronic conditions among older adults was a worldwide epidemic.7 The management of accumulated chronic conditions is likely to weigh upon healthcare financing over the next few decades in high income and in low to middle income regions.151617 Low to middle income regions face an ongoing agenda of communicable diseases and will have to manage the added burden with limited resources and infrastructure. Understanding and reducing the burden of disease among older people is critical to mitigate the economic burden of ageing and build sustainability within the global health system for the next generations.13

While ageing draws increasing attention from policy makers and stakeholders, global epidemiological data on the burden of disease in older adults are limited. Studies from high life expectancy populations do exist,41819 but most are based on localised sample populations without detailed analyses of adults older than 70.202122 Epidemiological studies from WHO,23 including the recently published world report on ageing and health, have highlighted an increasingly ageing global population and the need for urgent public health changes.7 The GBD 2019 study provides annually updated global, regional, and national population data on mortality, 369 diseases and injuries, and 87 risk factors among 204 countries.242526 Therefore, it provides an excellent opportunity for global and regional systematic analysis of causes of fatal and non-fatal health loss and risk factors in older adults.

The overall aim of the present study was to describe levels and trends in death and disability burden in the population aged ≥70 using GBD 2019 data. We approached this with several new metrics and assessments that leverage the GBD 2019 results. These assessments included life expectancy at age 70 (LE-70), the probability of death between ages 70 and 90 (20q70), assessment of diseases and injuries leading to changes in 20q70 through causal decomposition, calculating healthy life expectancy at age 70 (HALE-70), and the proportion of remaining years in ill health at age 70 (PYIH-70). To provide context to these analyses, we further evaluated the historical relation between LE-70, HALE-70, and PYIH-70 with two societal proxies for development: the sociodemographic index (SDI) and the healthcare access and quality (HAQ) index. Data coverage underpinning the GBD estimates was also assessed. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive and detailed assessment of the health of older adults.","Conclusions Life expectancy at age 70 has continued to rise globally, mostly because of decreases in chronic diseases.

731,731,https://www.healthline.com/health/spinal-and-bulbar-muscular-atrophy,Understanding Spinal and Bulbar Muscular Atrophy (Kennedy Disease),"Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), also known as Kennedy’s disease, is a rare genetic disorder. It affects certain nerve cells in the spinal cord and the brainstem. “Bulbar” refers to a bulb-shaped region in the lower part of the brain that controls voluntary muscle movement. Over time, SBMA makes it hard for you to control voluntary movements, affecting mobility, speech, and swallowing. The areas most affected by SBMA are the arms and legs, as well as facial and throat muscles. SBMA occurs as the result of a defect on the X chromosome . The onset is usually after age 30. The disease progresses slowly, and there’s currently no cure. Medications can help with pain and muscle spasms. Various types of physical therapy can help you manage your symptoms. People with SBMA can have an average lifespan, but usually require mobility aids and long-term care. Read on to find out more about why this disease occurs, what symptoms look like, and what we know so far about treating it.

Symptoms Most people who develop SBMA are assigned male at birth, or have XY chromosomes. Usually they experience onset of the disease between the ages of 30 and 50. However, SBMA can also show up in the teen years and later in life. Early symptoms usually include falling down, and struggling to walk or control muscles. Other hallmark symptoms include: muscle weakness in the arms and legs

muscle weakness in the face

difficulty swallowing (dysphagia)

slurred speech (dysarthria)

muscle twitching

enlarged breasts (gynecomastia)

testicular atrophy

erectile dysfunction As SBMA progresses, muscles in the hands and face (including the tongue) may twitch. Eventually, the nerves that control certain muscles start to die, leaving the muscles unable to contract. This causes numbness and weakness. In some cases, one side of the body is more affected than the other. Sex vs. gender in research articles A lot of research into SBMA refers to participants as “female” or “male” instead of as women or men. This is because most of these studies focus on chromosomes, one component of birth sex, and a key factor in understanding SBMA. “Female” and “male” refer to biological sex categories. Each is associated with specific genitalia, chromosomes, primary and secondary sex characteristics. Intersex people have characteristics of more than one sex. “Women” and “men” refer to society’s dominant gender categories, although there are many others. It is traditionally assumed people assigned female at birth are women, and people assigned male at birth are men. This is true most of the time, but not always. Biological sex is not the same as gender, nor does it determine someone’s gender. We use the phrase “assigned male/female at birth” to make space for this reality, while also acknowledging that certain biological characteristics can inform hereditary conditions. Was this helpful?

Causes SBMA is an inherited condition, caused by an X chromosome defect. The mutation in a section of DNA is called a CAG trinucleotide repeat. Our DNA is made up of building blocks called “nucleotides.” The CAG trinucleotide repeat happens when too many cytosine, adenine, and guanine nucleotides occur in a row. The affected DNA gene codes for the androgen receptor (AR), a protein involved in the processing of male hormones. When the gene has extra nucleotides in the form of a CAG trinucleotide repeat, the androgen receptors it codes for are defective. They can’t efficiently transport androgens. This results in some motor neurons being unable to work. The role of sex in SBMA The reason SBMA almost exclusively affects people assigned male at birth (often those with XY chromosomes) is that androgen function is involved in the disease. The androgen testosterone is the dominant male hormone. In rare cases of people assigned female at birth (often those with XX chromosomes) who have SBMA, symptoms are usually mild. Many don’t have high enough testosterone levels to activate SBMA’s androgen receptor mutation. People assigned female at birth can be asymptomatic carriers of the disease, and have a 50 percent chance of passing it to their offspring. If a male child (XY chromosomes) gets the gene, they would develop active SBMA. If a female child (XX chromosomes) gets the gene, they would be a carrier. SBMA research limitations There isn’t much SBMA research incorporating people with trans, nonbinary, or other gender identities as participants. However, some interesting findings include: One 2016 study of SBMA in a trans woman found that longterm estrogen therapy (which lowers testosterone and other androgen levels) wasn’t successful in preventing the disease.

of SBMA in a trans woman found that longterm estrogen therapy (which lowers testosterone and other androgen levels) wasn’t successful in preventing the disease. A 2018 study explains that people assigned female at birth, or those with XX chromosomes, may manifest the disease if carrying the gene and exposed to high testosterone levels.

Diagnosis When diagnosing SBMA, doctors will usually start by doing the following: consider your symptoms

conduct a physical examination

ask about your medical history

ask about your family’s medical history Doctors may also order various lab tests. This includes a blood test checking for levels of the enzyme creatine kinase, which is released by atrophied muscles into the bloodstream. The primary tool to diagnose the neuromuscular disorder is molecular genetic testing. This is a special blood test that looks for CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the AR gene. According to the National Organization for Rare Disorders, SBMA is diagnosed in people with more than 36 CAG trinucleotide repeats in the AR gene.

Similar health conditions SBMA shares some of the same major symptoms as other neuromuscular disorders. These include: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or Lou Gehrig’s disease

adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD)

myasthenia gravis While early symptoms make look alike for these conditions, there are key differences between them. Difference with ALS One of the main differences between SBMA and ALS is the speed of progression: SBMA progresses gradually, and people with the disorder often have an average lifespan.

ALS tends to progress quickly and result in death due to respiratory failure. According to the National Institute of of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) , most people with ALS die within 3 to 5 years. Unlike SBMA, which is always genetic, only a minority of people with ALS get the disease through inheritance. The majority of cases are sporadic. ALS can affect people no matter their sex or gender. In diagnostic testing for SBMA and ALS, a muscle biopsy or electromyography (EMG) is used to distinguish between the conditions. Difference with ALD ALD progresses slowly, like SBMA, but it tends to develop at a younger age than SBMA. Additionally, ALD often leads to cognitive decline. SBMA rarely causes any impaired thinking or memory loss. Difference with myasthenia gravis Myasthenia gravis also affects the voluntary muscles of the face and limbs, but it’s an autoimmune disease in addition to a neuromuscular one. The body’s immune system mistakenly attacks healthy neurons, disrupting communication between nerves and muscles. Myasthenia gravis tends to affect the eye muscles in particular. Symptoms can fluctuate in severity within a single day. It most commonly affects people assigned female at birth under age 40, and those assigned male at birth older than 60.

Management There’s currently no cure for spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, and no medications have been proven to slow or reverse disease progression. However, treatments exist to manage symptoms and reduce their severity. It’s important to understand that SBMA is a progressive disease. That is, it will continue to worsen over time. Most people with SBMA will eventually need live-in caregivers. Medications and ongoing research Here’s some important findings on SBMA management: Studies of anti-androgen drugs to block the impact of the AR gene have produced mixed results . There’s not enough research yet to support using these drugs to treat the disease.

. There’s not enough research yet to support using these drugs to treat the disease. According to the Muscular Dystrophy Association, a new class of drugs, called selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs), is being explored. Experts hope these drugs may one day be able to prevent or lessen the severity of SBMA.

Testosterone treatment, commonly used to treat gynecomastia and erectile dysfunction (two SBMA symptoms), can actually worsen disease. For those with SBMA experiencing gynecomastia, breast reduction surgery is another option.

A small 2013 study of the drug clenbuterol appeared to improve stamina levels in people with SBMA. Clenbuterol has steroid-like properties and is used primarily to help people with breathing difficulties, such as asthma. Medications to treat tremors and muscle cramps are often prescribed to treat symptoms. These may lessen pain and discomfort, but don’t affect the course of SBMA. Physical therapy and lifestyle adjustments In many cases, certain adjustments in your daily life can make managing SBMA a little easier. Because swallowing can become more difficult, cutting food into smaller pieces can help prevent choking. Consulting with a dysphagia specialist or speech-language pathologist (SLP) can help you practice safe and effective ways to swallow. Swallowing problems are often factors in early mortality among people with SBMA, due to complications such as pneumonia or asphyxiation. If breathing becomes difficult, respiratory therapy may be helpful. In addition, ventilation aids, such as a bi-level positive air pressure device, can make breathing a little easier. Because the leg muscles can become weak over time, a cane or walker may be necessary to walk safely and avoid fall-related injuries. Eventually a mobility aid (such as a scooter or wheelchair) may be essential. Physical therapy may help prolong the time before a person with SBMA is required to use a walker or wheelchair.","Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), also known as Kennedy’s disease, is a rare genetic disorder.

732,732,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/babies-born-pandemic-slight-developmental-lag-study-finds-rcna10872,Study finds slight developmental lag in babies born during pandemic,"Babies born during the early months of the pandemic scored slightly lower on a screening of their developmental skills than those born prior to the pandemic, regardless of whether their mothers had Covid-19 during pregnancy, a study published Tuesday revealed.

The study, in JAMA Pediatrics, followed 255 babies born in March to December 2020 in New York City, which was the U.S. epicenter in the pandemic’s early days.

The infants were screened for social, communication and motor skills at 6 months of age using a standard questionnaire about their ability to roll from their back to their stomach, how often they babble and other milestones.

In most areas, the babies born during the pandemic displayed lower scores compared to those born earlier. That held true whether they were born to mothers who had been infected with Covid during pregnancy or not, the researchers found.

The results may not be indicative of long-term lags in development, they added.

The differences were small discrepancies in average scores between babies born before and after the pandemic began, not higher incidences of developmental delays.

And while scores in social skills and fine and gross motor skills were lower among the babies born during the pandemic, scores in communication skills were a bit higher.

“It does, of course, give pause. Why the heck are these kiddos scoring less well on what I would consider very foundational skills, like motor skills, particularly?” said Sean Deoni, an associate professor of pediatrics research at Brown University, who has conducted research on the cognitive skills of children born during the pandemic but was not involved in the JAMA Pediatrics study.

He said he would have expected to see an effect on babies’ communication because adults’ masks hide their mouths when they talk and infants have had limited social interaction due to lockdowns.

“My initial impression would be things like language would be affected and motor wouldn’t be, and we’re seeing the opposite,” Deoni said.

All of the participants were born at the NewYork-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children’s Hospital or the NewYork-Presbyterian Allen Pavilion Hospital, and their scores were compared to those of 62 infants born at the same hospitals before the pandemic began who were also tested at 6 months old.

The researchers speculated that stress pregnant women experienced due to the pandemic could explain the drop in babies’ motor and social skills.

But lead study investigator Dr. Dani Dumitriu, an assistant professor of pediatrics and psychiatry at Columbia University and a newborn hospitalist at the Morgan Stanley Children’s Hospital, said it was likely due to several factors. The effects of being born into an environment of lockdowns and other pandemic-related stressors on families that interrupted childhood, such as job loss or unstable housing, probably contributed, too, she said.

She called the findings a “huge surprise,” particularly because researchers did not find lower scores among infants whose mothers had Covid while they were pregnant, compared to babies born during the pandemic to mothers who didn’t get infected.

“We expected there to be a difference based on what’s known from other viruses,” she said.

Mollie Wood, an assistant professor of epidemiology at the University of North Carolina Gillings School of Global Public Health and the lead author of an editorial published alongside the JAMA Pediatrics study, cautioned that pregnant women should not see these findings as reason to opt out of getting vaccinated and the booster shot or to stop wearing masks. She also said the study had limitations.

“It’s a very small sample, taken from a very specific health system in New York City, taken during a very limited time period,” she said. “Not that we can’t learn from things that way, but it does speak to a very small slice of the pandemic among pregnant people.”

While studies on how Covid might affect unborn babies’ development are still emerging, there is ample evidence of other risks that the illness poses to them. Pregnant women with Covid are more likely to deliver prematurely, which can lead to lifelong disabilities for their children, such as cerebral palsy. The virus also raises the risk of stillbirths among pregnant women, although the overall rate is still low.

What this could mean for the future

It’s not clear what the implications are of the results from the six-month screening.

“Six months is a very early developmental time point. It is not a good predictor of long-term outcomes,” Dumitriu said. “It’s a good predictor of what’s happening in the moment.”

But gathering this data early is crucial because it provides a “tremendous opportunity to intervene” should it become apparent that there are long-term deleterious effects on some children as a result of the pandemic, she said.

“Six months is a very early developmental time point. It is not a good predictor of long-term outcomes.”

“Six-month-old brains are extremely malleable and plastic, so we can already start talking at a public health level about what to do and potentially mitigate any long-term impact,” Dumitriu said.

Deoni, whose research in August 2021 found that reduced interactions due to lockdowns led to lower cognitive skills in children born during the pandemic, said the study was “super important.”

“If things continue as they are, there will be a set of children entering into day cares, preschool and school that may have greater need than we are used to,” he said.

But he emphasized that families are not powerless. Infants’ brains, he said, are resilient, and the most important action parents can take is to be involved in their children’s day-to-day lives. Reading to children nightly is a great way to connect with them and help them grow, he said.

“If your parents are being very interactive with you, if they’re talking to you, playing with you, engaging with you, getting on the floor,” he said, “it’s going to pay dividends.”","Babies born during the early months of the pandemic scored slightly lower on a screening of their developmental skills than those born prior to the pandemic, regardless of whether their mothers had Covid-19 during pregnancy, a study published Tuesday revealed.
The study, in JAMA Pediatrics, followed 255 babies born in March to December 2020 in New York City, which was the U.S. epicenter in the pandemic’s early days.
In most areas, the babies born during the pandemic displayed lower scores compared to those born earlier.
The differences were small discrepancies in average scores between babies born before and after the pandemic began, not higher incidences of developmental delays.
And while scores in social skills and fine and gross motor skills were lower among the babies born during the pandemic, scores in communication skills were a bit higher.",,[],[],['PANDEMIC'],[],,

Researchers at the US National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute have discovered new insights about lymphangioleiomyomatosis, a rare lung disease that affects about one in 200,000 Americans.

Scientists at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), US have uncovered new insights about lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), a rare disease that commonly features the growth of abnormal cells in different tissues and organs, including the lungs.

In their research of LAM cells, which was recently published in the American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology, the scientists discovered differences in the physical expression in the lymphatic endothelial cells. These cells appeared to resemble cells in lymphatics as well as blood endothelial cells. The characteristics were also noted in a small percentage of lung cells provided by people living with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), another rare lung disease. However, the researchers did not observe this phenotypical crossover when studying cells from healthy volunteers or from people living with Kaposi’s sarcoma, a blood-related cancer.

When LAM cells accumulate in the lungs, cysts can form and impede airflow, making it hard to breathe. To help people living with LAM and other rare lung conditions, researchers have been studying physical characteristics of the disease. LAM cells in the lung reside in nodules, which are small clusters of LAM and other cells that line the cysts and may be disseminated. These lung nodules also contain lymphatics, part of the lymphatic system, which supports circulation and immune function. Lymphatic endothelial cells line the nodules and provided new insight about LAM.

Researchers are hopeful that ongoing research and future studies will lead to personalised therapies for people living with LAM and other rare lung conditions. They also recommend studying and will continue to follow the role lymphatics may have in disease progression, which could support the development of new and improved therapies.","Scientists discover new features of rare lung disease0 SHARESPosted: 28 February 2022 | Ria Kakkad (Drug Target Review) |Researchers at the US National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute have discovered new insights about lymphangioleiomyomatosis, a rare lung disease that affects about one in 200,000 Americans.

DSTA and Saab will co-develop and design the Republic of Singapore Navy’s new Multi-Role Combat Vessel (MRCV)

DSTA press release

The partnership will see the two organisations jointly implement initiatives in the three domains of long-term supportability, people development and smart technologies. Under the MOU, DSTA and Saab will co-develop and design the Republic of Singapore Navy’s new Multi-Role Combat Vessel (MRCV), harnessing technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and data analytics to realise the MRCV’s concept as a highly digital ship.

Through this collaborative agreement, DSTA also aims to nurture local talent in surface ships design, naval and digital technology. Through work attachment and internships with Saab, DSTA engineers and scholars will get opportunities to deepen their technical competencies and better facilitate the build-up of in-country capabilities in the industry to undertake repair of composite structures for ships and radar overhaul in the future.

“This marks the beginning of an exciting partnership with Saab. Besides setting the stage to jointly deliver an advanced, digitalised and data-driven Multi-Role Combat Vessel, the partnership will help accelerate the growth of knowledge not only in ship design but also in technologies of strategic significance such as AI and data analytics. To this end, it will lead to a more robust in-country talent pipeline of defence engineers and technologists with real-world experience.”

Mr Mervyn Tan, DSTA’s Chief Executive,

Mr Mats Wicksell, Senior Vice President and Head of Saab’s Business Area Kockums, said, “This agreement is the result of many years of cooperation between Saab and DSTA and a recognition of our competitive edge in technology areas that are crucial for the future. We look forward to a deeper collaboration that will surely benefit both parties.”

Naval News comments: About MRCV

The new Multi-Role Combat Vessels will replace the ageing Victory-class Missile Corvettes, which have served with distinction since 1989. Delivery was initially expected to begin from 2025, with full delivery expected around 2030.

Besides improving capabilities, the new MRCVs will be custom-built for lean manning and incorporate technologies to automate certain functions. This results in the MRCV using less manpower – about half the size found in modern frigates. In addition, this will result in operational cost savings of up to 10 per cent, compared to similar-sized frigates.

Naval News understands the MRCV will be a surface combatant but it will also act as a mothership for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and unmanned surface vehicles (USV) to extend its reach and flexibility against threats.

The new MRCVs will be custom-built for lean manning and incorporate technologies to automate certain functions.

Naval News received preliminary information from various sources (who all wished to remain unnamed) that Saab is acting as prime contractor for the program. The design will be based off Denmark’s Odense Maritime Technology (OMT) Iver Huitfeldt / Absalon designs and displace approximately 10,000 tons at full load. It will feature an advanced electric propulsion system. The MRCVs will be assembled in Singapore by ST Engineering. The ships are set to feature Sea Fire radar by Thales and both ASTER and VL Mica surface to air missiles by MBDA. The design will also be able to accommodate mission containerized modules.

Naval News will try to confirm the above details during IMDEX Asia 2023, the naval defense exhibition held in Singapore in May.

The woman, a retired teacher who lived alone, was friendly and had a good relationship with her neighbours, residents told Chinese-language newspaper Shin Min Daily News.

A spokesman for the police said they were alerted to a case of unnatural death at Block 11 Holland Drive at 1.55pm on Sunday, and the elderly woman was found lying motionless in the unit.

A resident who declined to be named said she returned home to find several police officers outside the woman’s unit. A locksmith opened the door at around 3pm.

“I hadn’t seen her for a week. I thought she was away and didn’t turn on the lights at night,” the resident told Shin Min.

“Everyone called her ‘teacher’, as she used to teach at a nearby primary school. Every evening when she went for dinner, she would stop and chat with us.”

The resident said the woman’s next-door neighbour called the police due to the putrid smell.

The body was removed from the unit at around 5pm.

The resident added that the woman, who was unmarried, once said she was born in 1943.

A 70-year-old resident who wanted to be known only as Mr Hong said the woman had lived there for 40 years and everyone knew her well.

Other residents told Shin Min that the woman used to live with her elder sister until the latter died. According to them, the sister’s children never visited her.

Summary Companies Russian law threatens jail for 'fake news' spreaders

BBC chief says law appears to criminalise journalism

Moscow says Western media show anti-Russian bias

West has banned Russia's RT over Ukraine coverage















LONDON/LOS ANGELES, March 4 (Reuters) - Global news media said they were suspending reporting in Russia to protect their journalists after a new law that threatened jail terms of up to 15 years for spreading ""fake news"".

Britain's BBC said Friday it had temporarily halted reporting in Russia, and by the end of the day, the Canadian Broadcasting Company and Bloomberg News said their journalists were also stopping work. CNN and CBS News said they would stop broadcasting in Russia, and other outlets removed Russian-based journalists' bylines as they assessed the situation.

With Russia's attack on Ukraine drawing almost universal condemnation, Moscow has sought to hit back in the information war. Its communications regulator, Roskomnadzor, blocked Meta Platform Inc's (FB.O) Facebook, citing 26 cases of discrimination against Russian media. TASS news agency reported that Russia also restricted access to Twitter. (TWTR.N)

Russian officials have said that false information has been spread by Russia's enemies such as the United States and its Western European allies in an attempt to sow discord among the Russian people.

Lawmakers passed amendments to the criminal code making the spread of ""fake"" information an offence punishable with fines or jail terms. They also imposed fines for anyone calling for sanctions against Russia following the invasion of Ukraine.

The Kremlin did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the media companies' moves to suspend reporting.

News executives said the new law would hamper independent reporting and imperil journalists, and that their organizations must balance the obligation to audiences to report the news with protecting journalists against retaliation.

""The change to the criminal code, which seems designed to turn any independent reporter into a criminal purely by association, makes it impossible to continue any semblance of normal journalism inside the country,"" Bloomberg Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait wrote in a message to his staff. ""We will not do that to our reporters.""

BBC Director General Tim Davie said the new legislation appeared to criminalise the process of independent journalism.

""It leaves us no other option than to temporarily suspend the work of all BBC News journalists and their support staff within the Russian Federation while we assess the full implications of this unwelcome development,"" he said in a statement.

He added that the BBC News Service in Russian would continue to operate from outside Russia. Jonathan Munro, an interim director of BBC News, said the corporation was not ""pulling out"" journalists from Moscow but assessing the impact of the new law.

The Canadian Broadcasting Corp., the country's public broadcaster, said it had temporarily suspended reporting from the ground in Russia so it could seek clarity on the new law.

U.S. television newscaster ABC News said it would pause broadcasting from Russia as it assessed the situation. The Washington Post, Dow Jones and Reuters said they were evaluating the new media law and the situation.

""Our top priorities are the safety of our employees and covering this important story fairly and fully,"" said Dow Jones spokesperson Steve Severinghaus. ""Being in Moscow, freely able to talk to officials and capture the mood, is key to that mission.""

By ordering his forces into Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin has sparked the worst crisis between Russia and the West since the end of the Cold War, battering financial and commodity markets, sending the rouble into a tailspin and triggering an economic isolation never before visited on such a large economy.

Western governments and tech platforms have also banned the Russian news network RT, with the European Union accusing it of systematic disinformation over Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

MEDIA FREEDOM

Russia's Foreign Ministry says that the Western media offer a partial - and often anti-Russian - view of the world while failing to hold their own leaders to account for corruption or devastating foreign wars like Iraq.

Western leaders including British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and former U.S. President Barack Obama have long raised concerns about the dominance of state media in Russia and say the freedoms won when the Soviet Union collapsed have been rolled back by Putin.

The new legislation was drafted by Russia's upper house of parliament and signed into law by Putin, TASS reported. It appeared to give the Russian state much stronger powers to crack down, by making it a criminal offence to spread fake information, with a jail term. read more

""If the fakes lead to serious consequences, then imprisonment of up to 15 years threatens,"" the lower house of parliament, known as the Duma in Russian, said in a statement.

Russia had earlier cut access to several foreign news organisations' websites, including the BBC, Voice of America and Deutsche Welle, for spreading what it said was false information about its war in Ukraine. read more

The BBC said it would start broadcasting four hours of news a day in English on shortwave radio in Ukraine and parts of Russia, reviving an antiquated technology used in the Cold War to circumvent state censorship.

(PHOTO: Yahoo News Singapore/Nick Tan)

SINGAPORE — Japanese restauranteur Teppei Yamashita was jailed for four weeks on Friday (18 January) after he admitted to driving while under the influence of alcohol, and crashing into a zebra crossing light pole in 2020.

Yamashita, a chef and founder of Teppei Group, which is behind Teppei Japanese Restaurant, Hana-Hana Japanese Restaurant and Man Man Japanese Unagi Restaurant and Teppei Syokudo, was also banned from driving for four years.

The 41-year-old Singapore permanent resident's alcohol content level was nearly thrice the legal limit for driving. He pleaded guilty to one count of drink driving and one count of driving without due care and attention.

On 24 August 2020, Yamashita was at a restaurant near Tanjong Pagar MRT where he drank beer. He had his last drink at 10.20pm before leaving for his multi-purpose vehicle, which was parked at the multi-storey carpark of International Plaza. He drove to Tampines to send a friend home around midnight.

After dropping off his friend, Yamashita drove home alone. Traffic was light and visibility was clear, while the road surface was dry that night.

Lost control of MPV

While driving at the signalised cross junction of Tampines Avenue 10 and Tampines Avenue 5, he lost control of his vehicle and veered right. His car mounted a pedestrian island and hit the zebra crossing light pole, uprooting it. The damage caused was $501.25, which Yamashita fully restituted.

A driver who was following about two car lengths behind witnessed the incident. He saw Yamashita fail to follow a left bend of the slip road. Instead, Yamashita travelled straight, mounted the kerb of the pedestrian island and collided into the light pole.

The driver alighted and assisted Yamashita, noting that he reeked of alcohol. A police officer was dispatched to the scene and also noted this. Yamashita failed a breathalyser test and was brought to the Traffic Police for a further test.

The test, administered to Yamashita at about 2.06am on 25 August, showed that his alcohol content level was 102 micrograms per 100 millilitres of breath. The prescribed legal limit for driving is 35 micrograms of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath.

Story continues

The car's front portion was damaged, with its right wheel punctured and its left wheel twisted.

Three aggravating factors

The prosecution noted that drunk drivers are one of the biggest contributors to serious accidents on the roads. He cited three aggravating factors.

Yamashita had driven a long distance of about 20km from International Plaza to Tampines, putting both himself and his passenger in danger.

The car which Yamashita had driven was a large one, increasing potential harm to road users, especially those at the pedestrian crossing area. Property damage had also been caused, added the prosecution, which sought five to six weeks’ jail and four years’ disqualification for Yamashita.

Yamashita’s lawyer Josephine Chee argued for two weeks’ jail, stating that while the alcohol level was high, Yamashita had not driven in a manner which was particularly dangerous, and that no damage was caused apart from the light pole.

Chee said her client had completed chemotherapy for a brain tumour and submitted two doctor's letters detailing his extensive treatment. These letters highlighted the risk of Yamashita catching an infection if he was placed in a “communal setting”.

However, the prosecution replied that the chief medical officer of prisons will ensure that Yamashita receives the necessary care for his condition.

For driving without due care or attention, he could have been jailed up to six months, and/or fined up to $1,500. Where a person is a serious offender, he can additionally be jailed up to a year, and/or fined between $2,000 and $10,000.

For drink driving, he could have been jailed up to a year, and/or fined between $2,000 and $10,000.

The contraction followed a 4.0 per cent fall in industrial profits for the whole of 2022, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed, pointing to a downbeat start to the year for factories at large.

Industrial profit numbers cover firms with annual revenues of at least 20 million yuan (US$2.91 million) from their main operations.

The Monday data follows a flurry of economic indicators that show an uneven road to recovery from a bruising three-year battle against the pandemic.

Factory output growth accelerated to 2.4 per cent in January-February, data showed earlier this month.

While retail sales swung back to growth, property investment continued to decline despite robust government support aimed at reviving the ailing housing market.

Beijing is seeking to get the economy back on a recovery track and set a modest growth target of around 5 per cent for this year at this month's annual parliamentary gathering.

742,742,https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/temperature-infectious-diseases/129986/,How do temperature variations affect infectious diseases?,"Climate change is set to rise temperatures globally through greenhouse gas emissions, amidst this change, rates of infectious diseases are to become increasingly difficult to predict

Pathogens and their hosts are affected differently depending on the temperatures to which they are exposed to.

Former studies have shown that some parasites will fare better to climate change, and that temperature stress may increase host susceptibility, potentially increasing transmission.

In their distinct variations, these organisms are influenced by the type of variation and the average background temperature it is applied to.

Looking at temperature fluctuations – such as heatwaves – it is highlighted that temperature has varying effects on infection rates and disease outcomes.

The study suggests it will be increasingly difficult to predict the consequences of climate change on host-pathogen interactions as global temperatures rise, as well as the increased frequency of extreme weather conditions.

Sensitivity to weather variation

Infectious diseases have ecological effects on humans, as well as agricultural and wildlife populations – as seen with any viral infections, such as COVID-19. While pathogens and their hosts are sensitive to changes in temperature, researchers analysed the effects this may have on disease transmission.

The researchers began examining the effects of different temperatures on various traits in a host organism, using a small crustacean called Daphnia magna, and its known gut parasite, Odospora colligata.

They used this specific creature as transmission of the parasite is similar to classic environmental transmission, such as those seen with diseases such as SARS-CoV-2 and cholera.

Looking at how the organisms responded to three distinct temperature regimes, they saught information at a constant temperature, and two variable regimes, with daily fluctuations of +/- 3°C and three-day heatwaves of 6°C above ambient temperature.

From this, they then measured the crustacean’s lifespan, fertility, infection status and the number of parasite spores within their gut, processing the data into a statistical model to compare the impact of the three different temperature regimes.

Their results determined that daily fluctuations of temperature reduced the infectivity and spore burden of the parasite compared to those kept at the constant average temperature. Comparatively, however, the infectivity of parasites after a heatwave was almost the same as the infectivity of those maintained at the constant temperature.

Co-first author Pepijn Luijckx, William C. Campbell Lecturer in Parasite Biology, Trinity College Dublin, said: “Climate change is predicted to increase not only average temperatures but also temperature fluctuations and the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events.

“Yet although studies have quantified the effects of rising average temperatures on host and pathogen traits, the influence of variable temperature regimes such as heatwaves remains largely unknown.”

Some parasites can withstand sudden heat better than their hosts

Overall, the amount of spores in the crustacean host had increased after the three-day ‘heatwave’ when the background constant temperature was 16°C, however, this was reduced at higher temperatures.

This implies that the effects of temperature variation will result differently depending on the average background temperature and whether this is close to the optimum temperature for the parasite.

A negative side effect was that the fitness and reproductive success of the host crustacean were generally reduced when exposed to either the parasite spores or when experiencing variable temperatures.

This suggested that under some circumstances the parasites were able to withstand the sudden change in heat better than their hosts could. Other variables to consider would be the host’s ecosystem and whether that too, had already been affected by climate change already.

Luijckx said: “Our findings show that temperature variation alters the outcome of host-pathogen interactions in complex ways. Not only does temperature variation affect different host and pathogen traits in a distinct way, but the type of variation and the average temperature to which it is applied also matter.”

“This means that changing patterns of climate variation, superimposed on shifts in mean temperatures due to global warming, may have profound and unanticipated effects on disease dynamics.”","In their distinct variations, these organisms are influenced by the type of variation and the average background temperature it is applied to.

""At the end of December, I walked in and made the purchase with cash,"" recounted the Stomper.

""I chose to buy from the shop as it is recommended as one of the top 10 best pineapple tarts in Singapore. I decided to give my support to the local brand.

""I bought six tins of pineapple tarts and some love letters. Four tins were given away as CNY gifts for my siblings and I kept two tins for own consumption.

Those who lied will be punished - Duma chairman

BBC: access to accurate information is human right

Russia says it is fighing an information war















MOSCOW, March 4 (Reuters) - Russia's parliament on Friday passed a law imposing a jail term of up to 15 years for spreading intentionally ""fake"" news about the military, stepping up the information war over the conflict in Ukraine.

Russian officials have repeatedly said that false information has been spread by Russia's enemies such as the United States and its Western European allies in an attempt to sow discord among the Russian people.

Lawmakers passed amendments to the criminal code making the spread of ""fake"" information an offence punishable with fines or jail terms. They also imposed fines for public calls for sanctions against Russia.

""If the fakes lead to serious consequences then imprisonment of up to 15 years threatens,"" the lower house of parliament, known as the Duma in Russian, said in a statement.

The Duma outlined a scale of punishments for anyone deemed to have discredited the armed forces, with stiffer penalties for those who intentionally spread fake information or called for unsanctioned public action.

The amendments, which could not be viewed by Reuters on the Duma website, appear to give the Russian state much stronger powers to crack down.

""Literally by tomorrow, this law will force punishment - and very tough punishment - on those who lied and made statements which discredited our armed forces,"" Duma chairman Vyacheslav Volodin said.

President Vladimir Putin said the ""special military operation"" was essential to ensure Russian security after the United States enlarged the NATO military alliance to Russia's borders and supported pro-Western leaders in Kyiv.

Russian officials do not use the word ""invasion"" and say Western media have failed to report on what they cast as the ""genocide"" of Russian-speaking people in Ukraine.

The amendments have to be approved by the upper house of parliament before going to Putin to be signed into law.

'TOUGH PUNISHMENT'

Russian opposition leaders have warned that the Kremlin could crack down on dissent after Putin ordered the operation.

Russia's communications watchdog also cut access to several foreign news organisations' websites, including the BBC and Deutsche Welle, for spreading what it alleged was false information about its war in Ukraine.

""Access has been restricted to a host of information resources owned by foreigners,"" the watchdog, known as Roskomnadzor, said in a statement. read more

Russia has repeatedly complained that Western media organisations offer a partial - and often anti-Russian - view of the world while failing to hold their own leaders to account for foreign wars such as Iraq and corruption.

Britain's BBC said access to accurate information was a fundamental human right and it would continue its efforts to make its news available in Russia.

Clinically, the disease can present in many different ways, including polyarthralgias, endocarditis, and neuropsychiatric changes.

Whipple’s endocarditis is a rare disease in the literature, and is on the differential for BCNEThe presentation of Whipple’s endocarditis ranges from arthralgia to heart failure. A 2012 publication by Geissdorfer et al. found T. whipplei infection in 6% of all bacterial endocarditis cases, confirmed by specific PCR and culture [9]. In one large case series from 2001 encompassing 35 patients with Whipple’s endocarditis, 89% were male with the majority of patients being afebrile and not meeting Duke criteria for endocarditis [5, 6, 10]. Commonly, aortic and/or mitral valves are involved [6, 7].

Our patient presented with an acute peripheral arterial occlusion likely from a migrated cardiac vegetation due to Whipple’s endocarditis. Septic embolization is a common complication of infectious endocarditis (IE), and systemic embolization most commonly occurs in left-sided IE, potentially causing stroke, blindness, or splenic infarction [11,12,13]. The complication of acute limb ischemia from endocarditis remains uncommon. In a cohort of patients with IE, Uglov et al. report only 4.5% (12 out of 265 patients) presenting with thromboembolism of the arteries of the limbs. The majority of these patients required surgical interventions [14, 15]. Given the rarity of Whipple’s endocarditis, the occurrence of systemic embolization in this infection in the literature is extremely rare. Table 2 details four such documented cases.

Table 2 A list of four documented case reports of Whipple’s endocarditis causing embolism, all with valvular replacement and valve tissue NAAT diagnosis Full size table

Blood cultures obtained before the administration of antimicrobial therapy remain the mainstay of organism identification in the pre-operative diagnosis of infective endocarditis. In the absence of blood culture growth, optimal routine evaluation of excised cardiac valvular tissue includes both bacterial culture and histologic examination. Due to T. whipplei’s extremely slow-growing and fastidious nature which prevents growth in routine cultures, the diagnosis of Whipple’s endocarditis is challenging and often delayed. While a positive PAS stain of valvular tissue is considered the gold standard in the diagnosis of Whipple’s endocarditis, it has long been thought that this methodology leads to underdiagnosis. This is supported by the increased detection of T. whipplei in tissue by NAAT, compared to tissue PAS stain [3, 4]. The review of the literature by McGee et al. encompassing 156 cases of Whipple’s endocarditis diagnosed by direct examination of valvular tissue reports 51% case positivity by immunohistochemical staining and 72% by NAAT, compared with only 39% by PAS stain [10]. Our patient’s diagnosis was made with broad-range bacterial NAAT of FFPE valvular tissue.

Although no relevant FDA-cleared diagnostic assays exist, molecular detection of T. whipplei can be accomplished through laboratory-developed testing in larger laboratories or referral laboratories. Multiple diagnostic approaches can be found, including T. whipplei-specific NAAT, broad-range bacterial NAAT, or unbiased metagenomic NAAT assays. Depending on the laboratory and assay, testing can be performed on either a peripheral blood specimen or on excised valvular tissue, the latter using either fresh/refrigerated/frozen tissue or FFPE tissue. The sensitivity of T. whipplei-specific NAAT performed on peripheral blood specimens is lower than that of direct testing of valvular tissue [4, 20]. Broad-range bacterial NAAT of either fresh or FFPE valvular tissue should be considered in culture-negative cases if histopathology of resected valvular tissue demonstrates inflammatory changes and/or visible microorganisms. However, it is important to note the yield of targeted T. whipplei-specific NAAT tends to demonstrate greater sensitivity than broad-range bacterial NAAT for the diagnosis of Whipple’s endocarditis [4].

Whipple’s disease has a high mortality and a high relapse rate, with one case series reporting 24% mortality among 169 patients [10]. The fatality rate is difficult to determine due to the rarity of the disease and the difficulty in diagnosis. Treatment for Whipple’s disease is generally prolonged, with up to 12 months of antibiotics. The treatment includes an initial course of ceftriaxone 2 g IV for 2 weeks followed by trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole orally for up to one year, with doxycycline and hydroxychloroquine as second-line treatments instead of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [21]. Our patient completed a treatment course of IV therapy and continues on oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. He is tolerating the oral antibiotics well, without recurrence of symptoms at a 12-month follow up.

In summary, we report a case of Whipple’s endocarditis presenting with acute limb ischemia necessitating an emergent vascular intervention. The patient eventually underwent valvular replacement, and T. whipplei was detected by broad-range bacterial NAAT from valvular tissue, confirming the diagnosis of Whipple’s endocarditis without serology testing. This case emphasizes one of the myriad possible clinical presentations of Whipple’s endocarditis and the importance of tissue NAAT in the diagnostic workup of BCNE.","Whipple’s endocarditis is a rare disease in the literature, and is on the differential for BCNEThe presentation of Whipple’s endocarditis ranges from arthralgia to heart failure.

747,747,https://batonrougeclinic.com/are-more-people-getting-these-diseases/,Are More People Getting These Diseases?,"The prevalence of autoimmune diseases—conditions in which the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks its own cells—has been on the rise in recent years in the United States. What used to seem relatively rare has become more common. It is unclear if this is due to factors making people more susceptible to these diseases or if the rise is due to doctors being better able to recognize and diagnose these conditions.

Autoimmune diseases are twice as likely to occur in women as in men, according to research. Examples of these diseases include systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus), multiple sclerosis (MS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), celiac disease, type 1 diabetes, psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis, Guillian-Barre syndrome, Grave’s disease, Addison’s disease, Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, Sjogren’s sydrome and myasthenia gravis, among others. Some autoimmune diseases target a specific organ, but others may affect the whole body.

It is not uncommon for people to see multiple doctors before being diagnosed with an autoimmune disease. This may be due to the fact that many symptoms are vague, may appear unrelated or can be attributed to other common illnesses. In some cases, symptoms may not be taken seriously or are not considered as a symptom related to an autoimmune disease.

So what should you do if you suspect you have an autoimmune disease?","Autoimmune diseases are twice as likely to occur in women as in men, according to research.

748,748,https://www.neurologylive.com/view/disease-modifying-therapies-dmt-and-the-immune-system,Disease-Modifying Therapies (DMT) and the Immune System,"Klaus Schmierer, MB BS, PhD, FRCP: Talking about disease-modifying treatments, there are fundamentally 3 groups we can separate. First, the so-called immunomodulators. This is the type of drug that was first licensed and that includes interferons, beta interferons, and Glatiramer acetate. These can be separated from the cell traffic agent or anti-cell traffic agents, which there are mainly 2. So there’s on the 1 hand, natalizumab, an antibody that is a monoclonal antibody that is being infused every 4 to 6 weeks preventing immune cells of the adaptive immunity [from] entering the brain. With a different mechanism of action, there are the S1P [sphingosine-1-phosphate] modulators that prevent trafficking into the brain essentially by removing the cell type, or relatively removing the cell type from the bloodstream and restricting them to lymph nodes. Then there’s a third class of drugs, which are cell-depleting therapies, that includes the drugs like rituximab, ocrelizumab, cladribine, or alemtuzumab. These compounds are targeting mainly B-cell subsets and I think it is important to note, for these drug types, that they can be separated from those that are being [used] regularly. So these are B-cell indicator, ocrelizumab, ofatumumab, and maybe in the future drugs like obinutuzumab, [INAUDIBLE]. Then, on the other hand, the immune reconstitution therapies. First, alemtuzumab which has been around for quite a number of years now, 2014 first licensed, and cladribine or oral cladribine—Mavenclad. These are generally the types of drugs that we have available at the moment.

When we’re looking at the current understanding of how disease-modifying drugs work and can look at the risk that is associated with that, we should first look at the fact that the drugs that we are using are mainly focusing on the adaptive immunity. So these are B cells and T cells as opposed to macrophages and dendritic cells—cells that belong to the innate immunity. Through particularly the human experiments, or clinical trials, we have pretty good evidence that those cells that are driving the immune activity, targeting the tissues in the brain, that are essentially leading to symptoms associated with MS [multiple sclerosis], are in the B-cell pool. Now, when we are relatively selective depleting B cells, such as with ocrelizumab, ofatumumab, but also mainly with cladribine, then we’re obviously removing or we’re leaving out other cell types or depletion of other cell types that may be associated with safety aspects of these drugs.

What is important is that for some of compounds, although the main target is the adaptive immunity, these compounds do not only act on adaptive immunity. An example is alemtuzumab, which is an immune reconstitution therapy which very strongly depletes T and B cells. It also has an impact on the nonadaptive, innate, immunity and that obviously contributes to particularly the early phases after it has been given to the risk of bacterial infections that is associated with the drug. That then subsides because in immune reconstitution therapies you give a brief spell of drug and then you get the depletion and that recovers over time.

We know that with most compounds that are acting on the immune system in MS, perhaps other than the immune modulators that I mentioned earlier, that there is an increased risk of opportunistic infections. Opportunistic infections, we know, for example, in natalizumab is a prime example. A drug that prevents access of T and B cells to the brain that also affects the normal immune cell trafficking. Although it is a low level of trafficking, but it is important in order to keep opportunistic infections at bay. But if that fails [this system] we can expose patients to the risk of PML [progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy] so JC [John Cunningham] virus of which about 50% to 60% of the population harbor in their bodies. They are at risk for this.

749,749,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/rising-oil-prices-affect-thousands-products-rcna18985,Rising oil prices could affect thousands of products,"American drivers were in for another unwelcome surprise at the pump Monday. The national average for a gallon of gas rose about 5 cents overnight to $4.065, an astonishing 46 cents higher than it was only a week ago, according to AAA, and only a nickel shy of the record set in 2008.

With the war in Ukraine escalating and talk of the U.S. imposing sanctions on Russian oil, the price of West Texas Intermediate crude — the U.S. benchmark — topped $120 a barrel Monday afternoon. Andrew Lipow, the president of Lipow Oil Associates, said traders were steering clear of Russian oil ahead of a possible embargo. “What you see is that the oil industry is imposing a de facto ban on oil from Russia, so, in essence, that takes oil off the market,” he said.

Climbing prices at the pump are the most visible reminder of the rising cost of oil. But what people can’t see is also costing them. Petroleum derivatives hide in thousands of everyday goods and household products, from microfiber to moisturizer to medicine. Their prices are rising, too.

“Petroleum is at the root of so many different products, from makeup to plastic bags to fertilizer,” said Patrick DeHaan, the head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy.com. “You can’t escape the use of oil.”

About 60 percent of global oil consumption is in the form of fuel. Much of what remains goes into a staggering array of products and household goods, many of which don’t have obvious connections to oil.

Shoes and handbags made from vegan leather, for instance, are petroleum-based. So are nylon stockings, microfiber fleece and all sorts of other clothing made from synthetic materials. “If you wear eyeglasses, the cost of polycarbonate lenses just went up,” Lipow said, adding that he believes prices will go up on almost all goods with oil connections.

Everything made out of — or packaged in — plastic will be more expensive. “A lot of plastics are made with polypropylene or polyethylene, and the basic building blocks of those are propane and ethane,” said Stewart Glickman, an energy equity analyst at CFRA Research. “Those typically are a percentage of the price of a barrel of oil.”

Glickman said consumers can expect to pay more for smartphones, computers and TVs — all of which have plastic parts. And car prices are likely to stay in the stratosphere for longer. They don’t just run on gas — petroleum is a building block in tires to plastic body panels to foam seat cushions.

Rising oil prices will also show up at the grocery store. “The agricultural industry is in the higher-impact segment,” said Faisal Hersi, an energy analyst at Edward Jones. Industrial fertilizer contains fossil fuels, so more expensive fertilizer means higher prices on grains. That has its own impact; plus it also gets passed on to customers when they put meat, eggs or dairy products in their carts.”

Also affected: the health care industry. Nearly all pharmaceutical raw materials and reagents are petrochemical-based. Consider the average medicine cabinet: Burn ointment, cold and allergy pills, gummy vitamins, adhesive bandages — even some condoms — are made with oil.

If it’s made of particleboard, the medicine cabinet itself may be on the list. Oil is part of many building materials and furnishings, including asphalt roof shingles, plywood and shag carpet. “If you are buying furniture or insulation, the polyurethane that it is made from is going up in price. So are epoxies and adhesives,” Lipow said.

Tom Kloza, the global head of energy analysis for Oil Price Information Service, said, “Another thing you don’t think about is there’s a building boom right now.” That means even higher inflation on materials and machinery used in construction and infrastructure projects.

Lipow said asphalt, for instance, tends to make up 15 percent to 25 percent of the cost of a paving project.

Kloza said that as filling potholes and fixing roads gets more expensive, “it’s going to cost more to move from Point A to Point B for everything.”.

But it may be a little less painful to watch. Unlike gas prices, which are rarely out of view, analysts say, prices on many of those other products will creep up over weeks or months. And until you’re in the market for another pair of vegan leather shoes, you might not notice.","Andrew Lipow, the president of Lipow Oil Associates, said traders were steering clear of Russian oil ahead of a possible embargo.

Some at the factory say the job has left them injured.,"When Ines De La Luz showed up for work at the Amy’s Kitchen factory in Santa Rosa, California, wearing an arm brace, prescribed after she couldn’t move her hand at the end of a fast-paced shift making frozen burritos in July 2020, she says a supervisor ordered her to remove the brace and return to the production line.

It was the start of a 1½-year ordeal that would send her back and forth to a doctor who she says hesitated to give her tougher work restrictions, and eventually to a new job in the factory disinfecting the cafeteria, alongside other injured workers.

De La Luz and another injured worker who cleans the cafeteria say it was called “the corral,” like on a farm. Though they aren’t sure where the name originated, they say it highlighted the feeling that they were no longer important to the company, a family business that is one of the country’s top makers of vegetarian frozen and canned food. De La Luz says that in the fall of 2021, when she learned she was a candidate for surgery to treat her arm injury, Amy’s Kitchen told her it was eliminating her position in the cafeteria and laid her off.

“There are a lot of days that I think that I’m good for nothing, that my life will never be the same and that I’ll never live without pain again,” she said.

Amy’s Kitchen declined to comment on the specific accounts given by De La Luz and four other workers interviewed by NBC News, citing company privacy policy. “It saddens us to hear that a few of our employees may be having a poor experience with us,” Chief People Officer Mike Resch, who spoke on behalf of the company, said as part of a statement.

With about $600 million in sales in 2020, Amy’s Kitchen is among a select group of brands with a reputation for being socially responsible. It relies on organic ingredients and is still run by its founders Andy and Rachel Berliner, who named it after their then-newborn daughter, Amy, in 1987. In advertising, Amy’s Kitchen says that they “always cook our food with love.”

“At Amy’s, our heroes are our employees on the front lines who are coming to work every day so that we can continue to make food for people to eat,” the company said in one popular Facebook post at the start of the pandemic.

But one former and four current workers say that image is at odds with the painful reality on the factory floor. They say that the growth of Amy’s Kitchen has been made possible by increasing the speed of production lines and that workers are becoming injured in an effort to maintain the speed. They say that the conditions leave them especially vulnerable to repetitive stress injuries that gradually get worse over time.

Amy’s Kitchen employs 2,700 people across the country and cooks and packages its meals at production facilities in Idaho, Oregon and two factories in Northern California. The company also has four fast-food restaurants on the West Coast with plans to open more in 2022. The workers who spoke to NBC News all work out of the Santa Rosa factory, which is its oldest factory and functions as a command center for manufacturing operations.

The workers there say that the production lines have steadily increased in speed over the years without corresponding increases in pay or better resources to prevent injuries. After the pandemic started, Amy’s Kitchen executives said in several interviews that it increased production to meet “unprecedented” consumer demand for prepared foods.

“First, we were doing 21,000 plates in eight hours. Then they saw that they could do more,” said Cecilia Luna Ojeda, who has worked in the Santa Rosa factory for 17 years. She says that each production line now makes 25,716 plates of food during an 8 1/2-hour shift.

Resch declined to detail the specifics of how many plates workers prepare per shift. “We routinely lower or increase line speeds depending on a variety of reasons, including the number of positions being staffed, use of different equipment, and upstream/downstream constraints,” he said.

Amy’s Kitchen disputes that it mistreats injured workers. “If an occupational or personal injury does occur, we are committed to finding safe, reasonable accommodation for everyone and do all that we can to make employees feel supported from the onset of injury or illness to and through recovery,” Resch said. “We ensure they get the medical attention they need as soon as it is requested and when an employee does return to work, our Integrated Disabilities team works with them and their manager to make any necessary accommodations.”

But the workers say they are expected to prove any injuries they report to human resources with a doctor’s note, typically from physicians working at a nearby Concentra, a for-profit urgent care chain. The Concentra doctors seemed to look at them superficially or downplay their injuries, the workers say. De La Luz, who shared her medical records with NBC News, says when she complained to her first doctor at Concentra that his restrictions weren’t protecting her — because he wrote them as “suggested guidelines” that only applied to her “upper right extremity” rather than her entire arm, with an additional note that the “patient may work their entire shift” — he told her that he didn’t want to revise his prescription because “he was scared of Amy’s and Amy’s didn’t want us to stop working,” De La Luz said.

Select Medical, the parent company of Concentra, says it cannot comment on patient matters due to privacy laws. “With safety at the forefront of our care, our patients are individually assessed and treated by a clinician experienced in workplace injuries,” Select Medical spokesperson Shelly Eckenroth said.

Specialists that the workers see for follow-up treatment are more helpful, De La Luz and others say. But Amy’s Kitchen workers’ compensation doesn’t always approve the specialists’ recommendations.

Maria del Carmen Gonzalez has been unable to work with her right arm after she tore a tendon in her shoulder on the production line last April. After months of physical therapy, and working with just her left arm, her doctor recommended surgery, according to medical records reviewed by NBC News. But the firm overseeing workers’ compensation claims on behalf of Amy’s Kitchen rejected the doctor’s recommendation for surgery in October, writing that even though she wasn’t progressing, surgery was “not deemed medically necessary.”

A spokesperson for the insurance company that handles Amy’s Kitchen workers’ compensation claims declined to comment.

“I’m the one suffering with pain and who’s having troubles with my work. They say that they’re going to send me to someone else or that they’ll call me later but they never do,” Gonzalez said.

Her last job was in “the corral,” cleaning tables with her left hand. She wishes she could return to her old job but needs use of both of her arms to do so. “I feel like I’m in a cage because they’re always checking us and there are cameras,” she said. At the end of last year, she went on leave, and was waiting to see if the decision for surgery would be reversed and if she would receive workers’ compensation payments.

The push for unions and the pushback

Amy’s Kitchen ownership appears to be aware that at least some of its workforce is looking for a change. In recent months, a contractor has been holding meetings at the factory in which it divides workers into small groups to talk to them about unions. Workers say that the instructors who lead the meetings take a negative view of unions. In recordings of one the meetings obtained by NBC News, an instructor says that unions can charge membership dues without keeping promises they make. In a recording of another, a person that a source identified as the plant manager says that Amy’s leadership wants to stay free from unions so it can have a direct relationship with workers.

Resch and the plant manager confirmed that the company does not want its workforce to unionize. “We would much rather continue working and communicating with our employees directly than through a labor union or any third party,” the plant manager said in an emailed statement.

Ojeda says she first felt pain in her hand in 2006, but a manager told her it was probably her pregnancy hormones. By the time she finally underwent surgery in 2008, the tendon in her right wrist was hanging on by a thread, she said. “A lot of the workers don’t even call it human resources. They call inhumane resources because they really don’t care,” she said.

Ojeda noticed pain in her arm again in 2019, but says that she was required to show a doctor’s note before she was assigned a new job weighing plates of tamales only with her left arm. Then that side started to hurt, too. But when she complained, Ojeda says that she was again told that she needed a doctor’s note to prove she was injured. Ojeda says she was finally given paid time-off when she showed up to work with another doctor’s note and braces on both arms.

After working in the factory for 28 years, and surviving cancer in 2004, Janet Barcenas has chronic pain in her shoulder and her leg, and her doctor told her she will never recover completely. Her doctor wrote a note in 2020 requesting that she be allowed to use a chair while on the line. A supervisor initially rejected the request, she says, telling her “we’re not just going to do what the doctor says. We’re going to do what we think is best.” Barcenas says she complained again, telling a supervisor “that I was speaking not just for me, but for everybody.”

Janet Barcenas. Marissa Leshnov for NBC News

Human resources finally agreed to add chairs, she says, but they didn’t bring enough for everyone. On some days, there is no chair ready for her. “They act like we don’t need these things,” she said.

The workers interviewed make between $18 to $22 an hour. They received a $2 hourly raise in the fall of 2021, which the workers say was the result of a work stoppage protest that employees on the morning shift had organized. But after the pay increase, they learned that their health insurance costs would also increase.

Maricruz Meza, who had paid $320 a month to insure herself and her two children, now earns $22 an hour thanks to the $2 raise but says her premium will be $500 a month in 2022. Barcenas, who now earns $20 per hour, says her premium will be $814.

“This 2 dollars isn’t really going to do anything because the insurance just went up a lot,” Barcenas said.

Amy’s Kitchen responds that “due to a significant escalation in our medical coverage costs, we had to make some difficult choices this year,” though the company disputes that the increase will be significant.
