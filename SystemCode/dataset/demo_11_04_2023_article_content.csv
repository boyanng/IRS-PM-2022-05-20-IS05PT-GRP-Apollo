""TSMC making Taiwan its global R&D hub and manufacturing hub has not changed,"" Wang told reporters on the sidelines of parliament. ""TSMC investing in Taiwan, investing in Kaohsiung, also has not changed.""

Wang's comments come after Taiwan's DigiTimes publication reported, citing sources, that TSMC is slowing down its expansion plans in Kaohsiung and other Taiwanese cities.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC), a major Apple supplier, declined to comment, citing its quiet period ahead of quarterly earnings due next week.

The chipmaker broke ground last year on its Kaohsiung plant, which will produce mature 28-nanometer semiconductors.

In 2021, TSMC said the Kaohsiung expansion would also include advanced 7-nanometer chips, but the company later postponed plans to build the advanced chips there.

TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, said in January it expects softer demand due to a slowing global economy and would decrease its capital expenditure this year to $32-$36 billion, from $36.3 billion last year.

The company has in recent years ramped up investments abroad, announcing new chip factories in the United States and Japan.

TSMC's shares were down about 1 per cent on Wednesday morning, lagging the broader market.","TAIPEI : Taiwan's TSMC has not changed the investment plan for its new chip factory in the island's southern city of Kaohsiung, Economy Minister Wang Mei-hua said on Wednesday, responding to a media report of the chipmaker slowing down expansion at home.

https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/us-philippines-agree-to-complete-security-assistance-road-map-in-5-10-years,"US, Philippines agree to complete security assistance road map in 5-10 years","WASHINGTON – The top defence and diplomatic officials from the US and Philippines agreed on Tuesday to complete a road map on US security assistance to the Philippines in the next five to 10 years, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said on Tuesday.

Mr Austin said the long-time allies discussed the delivery of “priority defence platforms”, including radars, drones, military transport aircraft and coastal and air defence systems at a so-called “2+2 meeting” in Washington, which also involved US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and the Philippine counterparts of Mr Austin and Mr Blinken.

Philippine Foreign Minister Enrique Manalo said the two sides “redoubled” their commitment to modernising the Philippine-US alliance in recognition that “our partnership will need to play a stronger role in preserving an international law-based international order”.

Experts, including former US defence officials, say the United States sees the Philippines as a potential location for rockets, missiles and artillery systems to counter a Chinese amphibious invasion of Taiwan, which China claims as its own.

Mr Austin said that it was “too early” to discuss what assets the US would like to station at military bases in the Philippines under a recently expanded Enhanced Defence Cooperation Agreement (EDCA).

Mr Manalo said the EDCA sites were mainly aimed at improving military interoperability and addressing potential humanitarian disasters, “and perhaps respond to other types of security challenges”, but did not elaborate.

The Pentagon has not specifically said what the additional sites will be used for, except that work would include airport expansion and training involving naval assets.

Mr Manalo said on Monday that Washington and Manila will need to discuss what the US may do with its access to the EDCA sites.

The agreement allows US access to Philippine bases for joint training, pre-positioning of equipment and building of facilities such as runways, fuel storage and military housing, but not a permanent presence.

Relations between the two countries have warmed considerably under Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr, and the 2+2 meeting underlined that as the first of its kind in seven years. But Manila treads a delicate path with China, the region’s economic powerhouse.

Mr Marcos assured China on Monday that military bases accessible to the US would not be used in offensive action, stressing that the arrangement with Washington was designed to boost his country’s defences.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/inters-second-half-double-benfica-puts-them-course-semis-3411421,Inter's second-half double at Benfica puts them on course for semis,"LISBON: Inter Milan struck in the second half through Nicolo Barella and Romelu Lukaku for a 2-0 win at Benfica in their Champions League quarter-final, first leg on Tuesday (Apr 11) which put them on course for a first last-four appearance since they won the trophy in 2010.

Barella headed home firmly at the back post in the 51st minute, rising unchallenged to get on the end of a superb cross from centre back Alessandro Bastoni, who was storming up the left side and delivered a pin-point ball.

Substitute Lukaku then converted an 82nd minute penalty after VAR referred a handball by Benfica skipper Joao Mario for review by English referee Michael Oliver, who gave the spot kick after looking at the video monitor.

The two goals hand Inter a major advantage for the return leg at San Siro next Wednesday, where they will be heavily fancied to progress to an all-Italian semi-final against either neighbours AC Milan or Napoli who meet this Wednesday.

Barella’s goal exposed Benfica’s nervy defence but the penalty was unfortunate as a Denzel Dumfries cross hit Joao Mario on his head and then his upright arm inside the box.

But Inter deserved their victory, conjuring up the better chances with Benfica’s Odysseas Vlachodimos making important second-half saves to deny Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Dumfries and avert an even heavier defeat.

“One of the best matches of this season. We deserved to win, we played very well. We have taken the first step, we hope to do everything to advance,” Mkhitaryan told reporters.

Inter, who beat Benfica’s domestic rivals Porto in the previous round with a stoic defensive performance away in the second leg, were surprisingly adventurous at the start on their return to Portugal and dominated the early skirmishes.

But it was Benfica’s dangerous playmaker Rafa Silva who conjured up the first effort on target, firing straight at Inter goalkeeper Andre Onana after picking up a botched clearance by Federico Dimarco in the 16th minute.

Soon after, Joao Mario’s tempting cross flashed across the face of goal before Inter had their first effort - a powerful long-range shot by Francesco Acerbi that swerved dangerously close to the Benfica goal.

The hosts might have equalised five minutes after Barella scored but Dumfries got in the way during a goalmouth melee as Benfica’s strikers looked to sweep home a cross from Joao Mario that caused chaos.

Lukaku's precise penalty put Inter firmly in the driving seat before Onana made a vital stop on the final whistle to deny Goncalo Ramos a goal that would have given Benfica hope.

Benfica midfielder Chiquinho said: ""We knew it was going to be a difficult game, against a quality team. But nothing is lost.

https://www.straitstimes.com/business/cards-are-king-when-it-comes-to-making-payment-in-singapore-report,Cards are king when it comes to making payment in Singapore: Report,"In the Asia-Pacific region, digital wallet usage is expected to account for the most e-commerce (73 per cent) and POS (59 per cent) transaction value by 2026. In 2022, it was 69 per cent and 47 per cent respectively.

The report found the adoption of digital wallets by Singapore consumers lagging behind that in other South-east Asian markets, particularly for POS transactions, where e-wallets came in at 18 per cent in 2022.

Ms Yvonne Szeto, vice-president for commercial Asia-Pacific at Worldpay (FIS), believes this is “just a function of consumer habit”, given that credit cards are an established payment method in Singapore. Habits could change over time, especially with many retailers in Singapore now offering digital payment methods of various sorts at the point of sale.

Vantage Markets’ global payment manager, Mr Edward Ong, noted that shopping behaviour is ingrained, adding: “Everyone uses credit cards. (They know) which card to use when shopping for groceries and which one gives you the best cashback... so it’s very hard to change this behaviour.”

Singapore is a “very mature market” where the availability of credit cards and cards of all types is well established, observed Mr Nagesh Devata, senior vice-president for the Asia-Pacific at Payoneer. It also has more alternative payment providers meeting different consumer segments, including wallets provided specially for cross-border use or gaming.

He added: “Consumers are spoilt for choice... You start to think about how to compartmentalise your spending as a consumer. Do I use my card for certain types of transactions? You know, maybe I only use it for travel, but maybe for my daily use, I’m going to use my e-wallet.”

It would also be helpful for merchants to understand their customer demographics and payment preferences, suggested Ms Szeto. A recent survey by Visa showed that more than 40 per cent of Singaporeans chose not to make a purchase when they encountered a shop that lacked digital payment options.

Ms Szeto added: “For example, the younger generation, such as millennials and Gen Z, prefer that one-click checkout experience using the mobile phone, and perhaps the older generation do prefer (using) credit cards, debit cards and even cash. It’s just about offering various options to your customers and speaking to the payment service provider to understand the market you operate in.”","The report found the adoption of digital wallets by Singapore consumers lagging behind that in other South-east Asian markets, particularly for POS transactions, where e-wallets came in at 18 per cent in 2022.

Meanwhile, Musk has slashed staff at Twitter as part of dramatic cost cutting since his US$44 billion takeover of the San Francisco firm late last year.

The Insider report came less than two weeks after Musk joined experts in signing a letter calling for a hiatus in the development of AI.

The billionaire Tesla boss and other luminaries wrote that ""AI systems with human-competitive intelligence can pose profound risks to society and humanity"".

Those hopes were fanned by an analysis in the International Monetary Fund's latest World Economic Outlook that suggested the current high interest rates ""are likely to be temporary"" and predicted that, once inflation was brought under control, rates in advanced economies would eventually return to pre-pandemic levels.

Trading was largely sluggish as many markets reopened after a long holiday weekend. European stock markets opened broadly firmer, US stock futures pointed to a positive open for Wall Street shares and Japan's blue-chip Nikkei rallied over 1 per cent.

Supporting the case for global inflation easing further this year, data showed China's consumer inflation hit an 18-month low and factory-gate price declines sped up in March as demand remained weak.

South Korea's central bank held rates steady for a second consecutive meeting today, while the Bank of Canada is expected to leave rates unchanged when it meets tomorrow.

Friday's non-farm payrolls suggested labour markets remain resilient, boosting expectations for a 25 basis point (bps) US rate increase in May. Markets price in a roughly 70 per cent chance of a May hike, having last week priced such a move as a coin toss.

Traders still price in rate cuts by year-end as the economic growth outlook weakens, exacerbated by banking turmoil.

""It seems that we are currently in an environment that the world is looking at a soft landing and the need not to over tighten policy,"" said Nordea chief analyst Jan von Gerich.

""The payrolls number was strong enough to suggest that the economy could avoid a deeper recession but not too strong to suggest the Fed needs to tighten by much more.""

US March inflation data tomorrow could provide the next steer for markets on the rate outlook.

The dollar was broadly softer, giving up some its post-payrolls gains.

The dollar eased 0.3 per cent to 133.18 yen, after jumping 1.1 per cent yesterday. The euro was 0.3 per cent firmer at US$1.089 (RM4.8), while sterling rallied 0.35 per cent.

Bitcoin touched a fresh 10-month high at US$30,438 before pulling back to US$30,148, after breaking free of recent ranges on Monday. The digital token had been stuck between about US$26,500 and US$29,400 for the previous three weeks.

In Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.57 per cent, while MSCI's world stock index was up 0.3 per cent.

Japanese government bond yields mostly fell, after new Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda vowed to maintain the bank's ultra-loose monetary policy.

In his first speech after assuming office, Ueda on Monday said it was appropriate to maintain the bank's monetary policy for now as inflation has yet to hit 2 per cent as a trend.

The 10-year JGB yield fell to as low as 0.445 per cent, its lowest since April 4, after hovering at 0.465 per cent in the previous session.

""His remarks gave investors a relief,"" said Keisuke Tsuruta, fixed income strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.

News of the request by the AEPD came as France's privacy watchdog CNIL said it was investigating several complaints about ChatGPT and Italy's data regulator was reviewing measures proposed by Microsoft Corp-backed OpenAI in response to concerns that led the regulator on March 31 to ban the chatbot temporarily. The Italian regulator's board was meeting on Tuesday.

The Biden administration also said it was seeking public comments on potential accountability measures for AI systems as questions loom about its impact on national security and education.

Fine dust particles from the Gobi Desert have been increasing in South Korea and could reach “very unhealthy” levels in Seoul as soon as Tuesday afternoon, according to AirKorea, which is managed by the nation’s Environment Ministry.

The sandstorms are forecast to reach Japan on Wednesday, affecting visibility in the central region that includes Tokyo, according to a forecast from the Japan Meteorological Agency.

The impact is spreading after sandstorms hit 18 provinces and cities in China on Monday night.

In Beijing, commuters biking home from work were caught off-guard by the sudden bursts of dusty wind, squinting to avoid grit stinging their eyes and having to wipe thin layers of yellow dirt from their faces when they got home.

State media reported that thick sandstorms will hit Beijing through Wednesday. The capital has seen regular air pollution and an unseasonal number of sandstorms over the past few weeks.

The concentration of fine particulates in the air in Beijing is currently 46.2 times the World Health Organisation’s annual air quality guideline value, according to IQAir, a website that issues air quality data and information.

A dozen provinces, including Shaanxi, Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan and Hubei, Inner Mongolia and metropolis Shanghai, will be affected by sandstorms and major dust until 8am local time on Wednesday, the Central Meteorological Observatory said.

Chinese forecasters have warned citizens of respiratory dangers and very low visibility while travelling.

They have issued a blue weather alert warning for sandstorms. China has a four-tier, colour-coded weather warning system, with red representing the most severe warning and blue the least severe.

The sandstorms were again a hot discussion topic on Weibo, China’s Twitter-like social media platform, racking up 2.178 million chats.

One user wrote: “What! When I wake up, why doesn’t anyone issue a holiday notice, do you still have to go to work in the dust today!”

Beijing has regular sandstorms in March and April as it is near the large Gobi Desert. Dry weather has amplified the impact this time, causing widespread fires torching grasslands in Mongolia and forests in China’s Sichuan province.

A Chinese government official at the Ministry of Ecology and Environment recently said the number of sandstorms was now four times higher than in the 1960s, a consequence of rising temperatures and lower precipitation in the deserts of north China and neighbouring Mongolia.

The documents are part of a trove of highly sensitive material that has been posted online, sparking a US criminal investigation into a breach the Pentagon says poses a ""very serious"" risk to national security.

Ukraine is expected to launch an attack on invading Russian troops in the spring - its first major military push of the year.

But one top secret document said tough Russian defences and ""enduring Ukrainian deficiencies in training and munitions supplies probably will strain progress and exacerbate casualties during the offensive"", the Washington Post reported.

A document reviewed by AFP - this one marked ""secret"" - details the dire state of Ukrainian air defences, which have been instrumental in protecting against Russian strikes and preventing Moscow's forces from gaining control of the skies.

Ukraine's international supporters have worked to beef up the country's air defences, providing a mix of cutting edge and older technology to create multi-layered defences that protect against attacks at different altitudes.

But the February 2023 document - the authenticity of which could not immediately be confirmed - said that 89 per cent of Ukrainian medium and high-range air defences was made up of SA-10 and SA-11 Soviet-era systems that could soon run short of ammunition.

Based on munitions use at the time, the document projected that Ukraine's SA-11s would be out of missiles by late March, and its SA-10s by early May.","WASHINGTON: The United States has serious concerns about Ukraine's ability to make significant gains in an upcoming counteroffensive, as well as Kyiv's capacity to keep defending against Russian strikes, according to a Tuesday (Apr 11) report and documents reviewed by AFP.

https://www.straitstimes.com/business/banking/swiss-parliaments-upper-house-approves-credit-suisse-rescue-after-heated-debate,"Swiss Parliament's Upper House approves Credit Suisse rescue, Lower House disagrees","BERN – Switzerland’s Upper House of Parliament voted on Tuesday to retrospectively approve 109 billion Swiss francs (S$160 billion) in financial guarantees used to rescue Credit Suisse, after a heated debate.

Twenty-nine of Switzerland’s 46-member Council of States approved the measure.

However, the Swiss Parliament’s Lower House later voted against approving the government guarantees for UBS Group’s takeover of Credit Suisse Group. In total, 102 lawmakers in the Lower House cast their ballots against the motion, 71 were in favour, and two abstained in the vote.

The Swiss Parliament had recalled lawmakers for a rare extraordinary session to discuss the rapid rescue of Credit Suisse, as well as the government’s open cheque book response.

A shotgun marriage that saw Credit Suisse taken over by Zurich-based rival UBS for 3 billion Swiss francs, and propped up with more than 250 billion Swiss francs in guarantees and support, has been the subject of widespread criticism.

The votes are, however, largely symbolic as the state has committed the funds and lawmakers cannot overturn that decision. Lawmakers also acknowledged their lack of power over the deal.

In the lead-up to the merger in March, Swiss emergency law was used so that a sub-group of six Members of Parliament approved the financial commitment on behalf of the legislative body, to the ire of the almost 250 lawmakers left without a say.

“The use of emergency law has reached a level in the last three years that is beginning to annoy me,” said Mr Hansjoerg Knecht, a member of the Swiss Parliament’s Upper House.

Calling the situation where the legislative body can approve only the already committed credits “unsatisfactory”, Mr Knecht said that if Credit Suisse were to require more cash, there should be no use of emergency law to bypass Parliament.

The Bill will now be sent back to the Upper House for further debate.

The government had said in a statement that “if Parliament refuses subsequent approval, it will be tantamount to a political reprimand” for the group of senior lawmakers that gave it the green light, but would have “no legal effect”.

The Lower House’s rebuff of the government-brokered deal came despite repeated speeches by senior government ministers that the UBS takeover was the best of a limited number of options.

Swiss President Alain Berset said earlier on Tuesday that Credit Suisse’s “negative spiral” spurred his government into action and that, together with the Swiss National Bank and the country’s banking regulator, it had acted in “a decisive manner to restore confidence”.

‘Lots of questions’

“It’s the responsibility of politics to have a say, especially when such a big contribution is being made by state and emergency law is being used,” said Ms Celine Widmer, a Swiss National Council member for the left-leaning Social Democrats.

“We have a lot of questions that need to be answered,” she told Reuters ahead of the vote.","BERN – Switzerland’s Upper House of Parliament voted on Tuesday to retrospectively approve 109 billion Swiss francs (S$160 billion) in financial guarantees used to rescue Credit Suisse, after a heated debate.

“The use of emergency law has reached a level in the last three years that is beginning to annoy me,” said Mr Hansjoerg Knecht, a member of the Swiss Parliament’s Upper House.",2023-04-12 02:14:28+08:00
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/china-consumer-inflation-falls-below-1-march-3409516,China consumer inflation falls below 1% in March,"BEIJING: China's consumer price inflation fell below 1 per cent in March, official figures showed Tuesday (Apr 11), a sign of weak demand as the world's second-largest economy tries to recover from its pandemic-driven slump.

The March consumer price index (CPI) - the main gauge of inflation - came in at 0.7 per cent, down from the 1 per cent seen a month earlier, according to the country's National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).

Beijing is targeting an average inflation rate of 3 per cent for 2023, which is still far below the current rates of many developed economies.

Analysts had expected a faster pace in March, with economic activity picking up again after the abandonment of zero-COVID restrictions at the end of 2022.

The producer price index (PPI), which measures the cost of goods leaving factories, shrank for the sixth consecutive month, with prices falling 2.5 per cent - indicating lower margins for businesses.

""Economic recovery is on track but not strong enough to push up prices,"" Zhiwei Zhang of Pinpoint Asset Management wrote in a note.

""This suggests the economy is still running below its potential,"" he added, suggesting the data made an interest rate cut more likely.

Fresh fruit prices rose 11.5 per cent year-on-year, and pork, the most consumed meat in the country, jumped 9.6 per cent.

The cost of fuel for transport fell 6.4 per cent.

Globally, commodity and food prices are rising, though China has remained relatively unscathed by increases linked to the war in Ukraine.

""We think consumer price inflation will rebound in the coming months as the labour market tightens again,"" analysts from Capital Economics said in a note.

""But it will be well below the government's ceiling of around 3 per cent, and the increase in inflation will be far smaller than what was seen elsewhere when they opened up.""

China is targeting 5 per cent economic growth this year, one of the lowest targets in decades, but Premier Li Qiang warned last month that even this could be difficult to achieve.","BEIJING: China's consumer price inflation fell below 1 per cent in March, official figures showed Tuesday (Apr 11), a sign of weak demand as the world's second-largest economy tries to recover from its pandemic-driven slump.

https://www.straitstimes.com/world/un-asks-afghan-staff-to-stay-home-until-may-after-female-worker-ban,UN asks Afghan staff to stay home until May after female worker ban,"UNITED NATIONS - The United Nations’ mission to Afghanistan has launched a review of its operations and asked all Afghan employees not to come to work at least until May, after the Taliban administration barred its women employees from working, it said in a statement on Tuesday.

The UN said last week that the Taliban, who swept to power in 2021, had communicated that Afghan women would not be able to work for the global organisation.

Taliban officials have not commented on the order.

“Through this ban, the Taliban de facto authorities seek to force the United Nations into having to make an appalling choice between staying and delivering in support of the Afghan people and standing by the norms and principles we are duty-bound to uphold,” the UN mission, known as Unama, said.

The UN has said that implementing the order would put the global organisation in breach of its charter.

It has asked some 3,000 employees – men and women – to stay home until May 5 while it made “necessary consultations”, any required adjustments to its operations and accelerated contingency planning.

The restriction on female UN workers, coming in the wake of a ban on most female non-governmental organisation workers in December, has prompted heavy international criticism.

Some officials have flagged concerns that donors may pull back on support to Afghanistan’s humanitarian aid programme, the largest in the world, and that implementing some programmes and reaching women in the conservative country without female workers would not be possible.

The Taliban have imposed a series of restrictions on women’s access to work, education and public life.

https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/french-president-macron-praised-in-china-for-brilliant-taiwan-comments,French President Macron praised in China for ‘brilliant’ Taiwan comments,"BEIJING - Mr Emmanuel Macron’s unexpected suggestion that Europe not “follow” US policy on Taiwan is being hailed as a “brilliant decision” this week in China, where state news outlets and social media users are lauding his independence.

The French President sowed confusion across the international community – and left Western allies bristling – after calling for “strategic autonomy” on Taiwan following last week’s trip to China, where he met with President Xi Jinping.

The 45-year-old Mr Macron enjoyed a rock star reception during his three-day visit, including being mobbed by selfie-chasing students in the southern city of Guangzhou, and the local media has covered his subsequent comments widely, focusing on the phrase “strategic autonomy”.

An opinion piece published on Monday by the Communist Party of China-run Global Times said the comments were “clearly the result of Macron’s long-term observation and reflection” and represented a path that was “relatively objective, rational and in line with Europe’s own interests”.

“Some people want to construct a false Europe in public opinion, masking true European voices and interests,” the article added.

Mr Chen Weihua, Brussels bureau chief for the state-run China Daily, wrote on Twitter that “Macron’s words about EU strategic autonomy and resisting a new Cold War and decoupling will also prove to be a brilliant decision”.

Beijing, which regards Taiwan as a renegade province to be reunified by force if necessary, has long sought to break Western resolve on the thorny issue.

And Mr Macron’s recent words on distancing Europe from Washington on the subject of Taiwan suggest China’s efforts might be having some success.

“Daring to talk openly about autonomy,” commented a user of social media site Weibo under a news article on Mr Macron, “Europe has progressed”.

While the reputations of most Western leaders in China have suffered in recent years, Mr Macron enjoys a largely favourable public image – an attitude made evident by the hordes of students in Guangzhou.

His willingness in the recent interview to differentiate French foreign policy from that of the United States on the issue of Taiwan helped bolster that fan base.

One Weibo user commented: “Macron’s ideas are very good. Europe’s arrogance and inaction for many years have led to extreme strategic passivity, being pulled along by the US.”

But such triumphant Chinese perspectives have also been tempered by more sober voices contending that geopolitical realities necessitate that France and Europe remain largely aligned with the US.

Mr Hu Xijin, a prominent political commentator and former editor-in-chief of the Global Times, wrote on Monday on Weibo that – despite Mr Macron’s rosy comments – it was “unrealistic” for China to think France would side with it in future confrontations with the US.","The French President sowed confusion across the international community – and left Western allies bristling – after calling for “strategic autonomy” on Taiwan following last week’s trip to China, where he met with President Xi Jinping.

The euro was up 0.4 per cent at US$1.0903 (RM4.8) and the pound was up 0.5 per cent at US$1.2439 as most European markets returned from the long Easter weekend.

Both currencies over the break had slipped from their early April peaks after resilient US labour market released Friday bolstered the case for a Federal Reserve rate hike next month, and also eased fears about a sharper slowdown in the US economy.

""The Fed's early May meeting is beginning to loom and the data on the way to that is very much the focus,"" said Jane Foley, head of FX strategy at Rabobank.

She said the euro's ability to jump clear of US$1.09 would depend on the upcoming data and what it meant for US interest rates.

""Bank earnings will also be important, they don't often reach across to FX markets directly, but they might given the recent jitters,"" Foley added.

Today's moves were also affected by European markets' reopening after the break, said Simon Harvey, head of FX analysis at Monex Europe, given the limited liquidity on Friday and Monday with most European markets closed.

He said algorithms trading currencies based on the difference between European and US rates might have sold euros for dollars when US Treasury yields rose after the jobs data while European bond markets were closed.

Key military officials from the two nations were present at the opening ceremony for the 38th Exercise Balikatan at the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) headquarters in Manila.

Balikatan means “shoulder-to-shoulder” in Tagalog. The war games will run until April 28.

Officials said a major highlight of the military exercise is the live-fire drills at sea to be held on April 26, about 12 nautical miles from the coast of Zambales, a province located near the South China Sea, waters in which Beijing and Manila have competing claims.

A decommissioned Philippine Navy ship will be bombarded with rockets and missiles by both the US and the Philippines to demonstrate the long-time allies’ maritime defence capabilities.

“It demonstrates that we are competent in employing combined arms and joint capabilities. We are demonstrating that we are combat-ready. We have the capacity to fire on a target from the land, from the air and from the sea,” said Colonel Michael Logico, AFP spokesman for Balikatan.

He added that Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr will observe the live demonstration and that he was excited to watch the two forces in action.

The annual war games will be held in key areas in the Philippines, including some provinces such as Zambales and Palawan, whose coastlines are just hundreds of kilometres away from the South China Sea and Taiwan.

Balikatan will involve more than 17,600 soldiers – 12,200 from the US and 5,400 from the Philippines – making it the biggest iteration of the war games thus far, at a time when China is ramping up its military activities in the region.

Australia is also deploying more than 100 soldiers for Balikatan, while allied countries such as Japan, India, Canada and Britain are sending military observers.

The Philippine Coast Guard continues to monitor scores of suspected Chinese militia ships in the eastern parts of the South China Sea that lie within Manila’s exclusive economic zone.

The country calls this area the West Philippine Sea.

The heightened surveillance comes as eight Chinese navy ships maintain a presence in waters around Taiwan, despite the end of three-day-long war games held by China in the wake of a meeting last week between Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen and US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in California.

Experts have said that because of its geographical location, the Philippines is at risk of being caught in the crossfire should tensions escalate over Taiwan.","MANILA – The Philippines and the United States on Tuesday launched their biggest-ever joint military exercise, which will include a ship-sinking rocket bombardment drill in the South China Sea, as tensions flare over Beijing’s rising military aggression in the region.

https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/biden-lands-in-northern-ireland-with-vow-to-keep-the-peace,Biden lands in Northern Ireland with vow to 'keep the peace',"BELFAST - US President Joe Biden landed in Northern Ireland on Tuesday, hoping to help maintain the fragile peace brokered 25 years ago after decades of sectarian violence over British rule.

Before boarding Air Force One, Mr Biden, 80, said the priority for his trip was “to keep the peace” and bring an end to the protracted political deadlock caused by opposition among pro-United Kingdom parties to post-Brexit trading rules.

British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak met Mr Biden on the tarmac when he touched down in the Northern Irish capital, just 24 hours after the landmark anniversary of the Good Friday/Belfast Agreement.

But security remains a concern.

On Monday, masked youths pelted police vehicles with petrol bombs during an illegal march by dissident republicans in Londonderry, which is also known as Derry.

Despite the scenes, US officials said Mr Biden was “very excited for this trip”.

“We’d like to see the national assembly (in Belfast) returned, clearly,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters en route to Belfast, with the Stormont legislature currently suspended.

“The message is twofold. It’s congratulations on 25 years of the Good Friday agreement… (and) to talk about the importance of trying to work on trade and economic policies that benefit all communities as well as the United States,” he said.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sustainability/explainer-why-clean-energy-transition-so-important-g7-chair-japan-3412141,Explainer: Why a clean energy transition is so important to G7 chair Japan,"TOKYO: Japan needs to import nearly everything from oil to liquefied natural gas (LNG), putting a clean energy transition at the core of domestic and foreign policy for this year's chair of the Group of Seven (G7) developed nations.

Energy-poor Japan, the world's third-biggest economy, aims to reach carbon neutrality by 2050 using a mix of fuels like hydrogen, wind and nuclear power.

WHY DOES HYDROGEN AND ITS DEFINITION MATTER FOR JAPAN?

Hydrogen has been touted as a clean alternative to fossil fuels, and major industries including energy, autos, steel and chemicals are looking at how to switch to hydrogen to reduce carbon emissions.

Japan wants to change the definition of hydrogen to two types - clean or not clean. Clean hydrogen is produced from renewable energy or from fossil fuels but with carbon capture and storage (CCS), according to Japan's ministry of economy, trade and industry (METI).

Currently hydrogen is colour-coded by the type of the source it is produced from, a definition that also reflects its cleanliness or greenness.

Japan wants to boost hydrogen supply to 12 million tonnes annually by 2040 from some 2 million tonnes now and has agreed with a number of countries worldwide from Australia to the Middle East on supply chains.

WHAT IS THE ROLE OF AMMONIA?

Japan aims to extend the lifespan of its coal-fired power plants in an ambitious project to add ammonia, a toxic gas made of nitrogen and hydrogen, to its fuel mix, targeting stable energy supply and lower carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in one stroke.

Its top power generator JERA has been conducting a trial project at its power station in central Japan since 2021. Japan wants to establish supply chains together with Australia, Norway and the Middle East among others, while boosting its fuel ammonia demand to 3 million tonnes annually by 2030 from zero at present.

It has so far agreed with other G7 nations to acknowledge hydrogen and ammonia's role as effective emission reduction tools but has opposed Britain's proposal to G7 nations to phase out domestic unabated coal power generation by 2030.

WHAT DOES JAPAN THINK OF LNG?

Japan sees LNG as a transition fuel to greener energy which could be needed for at least 10 to 15 more years, but it so far has failed to convince other G7 members to pledge big investments into this fossil fuel.

At present, it still imports some of its LNG from Russia.

For Japan, CCS technology - which removes CO2 emissions from the atmosphere and stores them underground - is also essential for it to keep using fossil fuels. A long-term roadmap released this year targets annual CO2 storage capacity of 6 million to 12 million tonnes by 2030.

HOW CAN JAPAN CUT POWER SECTOR EMISSIONS?

Japan, the world's fifth-biggest emitter, gets around one-quarter of its electricity from clean sources including generation from solar, wind, hydropower, biomass and nuclear.

Japan aims to install up to 10 gigawatts of offshore wind capacity by 2030 and to cut emissions by 46 per cent from 2013 levels. That would involve boosting renewable energy to 36 per cent to 38 per cent of its electricity mix - double 2019's levels - and nuclear power to 20 per cent to 22 per cent from 6 per cent.

Quake-prone Japan, which previously said it had no plans to build new reactors, made a major shift in nuclear power policy last year. It will now seek to replace decommissioned reactors and extend the lifespan of others after the 2011 Fukushima disaster prompted it to idle most of them.

DOES JAPAN HAVE A CARBON PRICING SCHEME?

Japan is introducing a carbon pricing scheme in stages starting this month that combines emissions trading and a carbon levy to encourage companies to curb pollution.

G7 climate change and energy ministers believe that carbon pricing is a key measure in the developed world's move to net zero, according to a draft communique from April 5.

WHAT IS THE ROLE OF BATTERIES?

Batteries are central to Japan becoming carbon neutral by 2050 because they are critical for the electrification of mobility devices and the storage of renewable energy.

Japan is targeting more than US$24 billion in investments both from the public and private sectors to develop domestic battery production capacity of 150 gigawatt hours (GWh) by 2030, and global production by Japanese companies of 600 GWh.","TOKYO: Japan needs to import nearly everything from oil to liquefied natural gas (LNG), putting a clean energy transition at the core of domestic and foreign policy for this year's chair of the Group of Seven (G7) developed nations.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/lunar-start-ispace-blasts-tokyo-market-debut-3411691,Lunar start-up ispace blasts off in Tokyo market debut,"TOKYO : Lunar transportation start-up ispace Inc had a blistering market debut in Tokyo on Wednesday as investors scrambled to buy shares in the company that aims to land the first commercial probe on the moon.

Such was the glut of buy orders and demand to hold the shares that they went untraded all day.

They were being quoted at their daily upper price limit of 585 yen at the end of the session on the Tokyo stock exchange's growth market, more than double the initial public offer price of 254 yen.

When a stock is untraded due to a glut of buy orders, it is given a ""forced"" closing price by the exchange that reflects the balance of buy and sell orders.

Analysts said investors bid for the shares of ispace, which raised 6.7 billion yen ($50 million) in its IPO, because its lunar development and transportation business fits in with Japan's national policy of defence and space development.

Japan is boosting spending in those areas, which in turn makes investors bullish, said Tastunori Kawai, chief strategist at AU Kabucom Securities.

""IPOs that fit with national policy themes tend to be successful, as is the case with biotech ventures,"" he said.

In December, the start-up's Hakuto-R Mission 1 lunar lander was launched aboard a SpaceX rocket that took off from Cape Canaveral, Florida, carrying two robotic rovers.

ispace said in a statement on Wednesday that it expected the lander to touch down on the moon's surface at 1640 GMT on April 25, at the earliest. The vehicle is currently orbiting the moon at an altitude of 100 kms (62.14 miles).

If successful, it will mark the first ever lunar landing by a private company. Only the governments of the United States, Russia and China have nailed such a feat, with landing attempts by India and a private Israeli company ending in failure in recent years.

LUNAR COLONY

ispace is working with spacecraft software firm Draper to help bring NASA payloads to the moon from 2025 and is targeting building a permanently staffed lunar colony by 2040.

""We've gotten a lot of attention from many people including shareholders and investors and renewed our desire to steadily expand our business in the future,"" Takeshi Hakamada, ispace's founder and chief executive, told reporters.

The company had intended to raise around 6 billion yen in its IPO, but later boosted the size of the share sale.

It sold 26.5 million shares in the increased IPO. There was a greenshoe option of up to 1.2 million shares. With 80.4 million shares outstanding, the company reached a market capitalisation of about 47 billion yen after the shares rose by their daily limit.

Many Swiss parliamentarians have criticised the shotgun marriage, which saw Credit Suisse taken over by rival UBS for 3 billion Swiss francs (RM14.7 billion) and propped up with over 250 billion francs in guarantees and support.

Today, they will meet in Bern for an extraordinary session to discuss Credit Suisse’s downfall as well as the government’s open chequebook response.

The unusual event - the third such session in over twenty years - provides parliament with a chance to reject the massive loans given as part of the rescue package.

The vote is, however, largely symbolic as the state has already committed the funds and lawmakers cannot overturn that decision.

In the lead-up to the announced merger, a sub-group of six members of parliament approved the financial commitment on behalf of the legislative body, to the ire of the almost 250 lawmakers left without a say.

“It’s the responsibility of politics to have a say especially when such a big contribution is being made by state and emergency law is being used,” said Celine Widmer, a member of the Swiss National Council for the left-leaning Social Democrats.

“We have a lots of questions that need to be answered,” she told Reuters.

“There is a lot of anger and frustration in the Swiss population and we can feel that,” said Roland Fischer, another lawmaker. “In theory, we could reject it but that would not hold up legally.”

Today’s session, lawmakers will get a chance to challenge the rushed rescue package and discuss whether conditions can be imposed on Credit Suisse.

Last week, Switzerland announced it was cutting bonus payments for Credit Suisse’s top management.

“We demand a thorough investigation into how the Credit Suisse crisis could have come about,” Thierry Burkart, leader of the centre-right FDP party, told Swiss newspaper Tages-Anzeiger.

“The de facto state guarantee of the systematically important banks is a big problem.”

Credit Suisse’s rescue angered not only politicians but many in Switzerland. A survey by political research firm gfs.bern found a majority of Swiss did not support the deal.

A poll of Swiss economists found that nearly half think the takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS was not the best solution, warning the saga has dented Switzerland’s reputation.

Switzerland’s KOF economic research institute found that 48% of the 167 university economists it questioned would have preferred a state takeover and possible later sale of Credit Suisse.

There are also growing worries about a staff cull.

In an open letter to the country’s parliament, the Swiss Bank Employees’ Association said on Tuesday that Credit Suisse and UBS must freeze any job cuts. — Reuters","BERN, April 11 — Since Switzerland’s authorities last month pulled out all the stops to rush through a rescue of Credit Suisse, a storm has been brewing in the normally tranquil country.

The rules drafted by the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) come as several governments are considering how to mitigate the dangers of the emerging technology, which has experienced a boom in investment and consumer popularity in recent months after the release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

They also come after a slew of Chinese tech giants, including Baidu, SenseTime and Alibaba, showed off in recent weeks their new AI models, which can power applications ranging from chatbots to image generators.

The CAC said that China supports AI innovation and application and encourages use of safe and reliable software, tools and data resources, but content generated by generative AI had to be in line with the country’s core socialist values.

The regulator also said service providers must require users to submit their real identities and related information.

Providers will be fined, have their services suspended, or even face criminal investigations if they fail to comply with the rules.

If inappropriate content is generated by their platforms, the companies must update the technology within three months to prevent similar content from being generated again, the CAC said.

ChatGPT, an AI programme that recently grabbed the public’s attention for its ability to write answers quickly to a wide range of queries, in particular has attracted US lawmakers’ attention as it has grown to be the fastest-growing consumer application in history with more than 100 million monthly active users.

The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), a Commerce Department agency that advises the White House on telecommunications and information policy, wants input as there is “growing regulatory interest” in an AI “accountability mechanism”.

The agency wants to know if there are measures that could be put in place to provide assurance “that AI systems are legal, effective, ethical, safe, and otherwise trustworthy”.

“Responsible AI systems could bring enormous benefits, but only if we address their potential consequences and harms. For these systems to reach their full potential, companies and consumers need to be able to trust them,” said NTIA administrator Alan Davidson.

President Joe Biden last week said it remained to be seen whether AI is dangerous.

“Tech companies have a responsibility, in my view, to make sure their products are safe before making them public,” he added.

ChatGPT, which has wowed some users with quick responses to questions and caused distress for others with inaccuracies, is made by California-based OpenAI and backed by Microsoft.

NTIA plans to draft a report as it looks at “efforts to ensure AI systems work as claimed – and without causing harm” and said the effort will inform the Biden administration’s ongoing work to “ensure a cohesive and comprehensive federal government approach to AI-related risks and opportunities”.

A tech ethics group, the Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Digital Policy, asked the United States Federal Trade Commission to stop OpenAI from issuing new commercial releases of GPT-4 saying it was “biased, deceptive, and a risk to privacy and public safety”.

HSBC USA said the hiring will help the bank establish a dedicated banking practice focused on serving companies in technology and healthcare, as well as investors who support them.

HSBC has initially assembled a team of more than 40 bankers in the San Francisco Bay Area, Boston and New York City as part of this initiative, it said.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation took over Silicon Valley Bank on March 10 after depositors rushed to pull out their money in a bank run that also brought down Signature Bank and wiped out more than half the market value of several other US regional lenders.

United States regulators decided to backstop a deal for regional lender First Citizens BancShares to acquire the failed Silicon Valley Bank, triggering an estimated US$20 billion (S$26.6 billion) hit to a government-run insurance fund.

HSBC said other hires included Ms Sunita Patel, who will oversee investor coverage and business development for the technology and healthcare market; Ms Katherine Andersen, who will lead life sciences and healthcare; and Ms Melissa Stepanis, who will oversee technology.

HSBC’s new banking practice will sit within the bank’s US commercial banking business, it said.

In March, HSBC bought the British arm of Silicon Valley Bank for a symbolic £1 (S$1.65), rescuing a key lender for technology start-ups in Britain.

https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/golf/pga-tour-player-blog-winning-masters-a-pretty-incredible-feeling-says-rahm,"PGA Tour player blog: Winning Masters a pretty incredible feeling, says Rahm","It’s very hard to put it into words what it means for me to win the Masters. We all dream of things like this as players, and you try to visualise what it’s going to be like and what it’s going to feel like when you achieve this goal.

When I hit my third shot onto the 18th green on Sunday, I could tell it was close by the crowd’s reaction and the wave of emotion of so many things just overtook me. I’d never thought I was going to cry by winning a golf tournament, but I got very close to doing so at the end.

A lot of it is because of what winning the Masters means to me, and to Spanish golf. It’s Spain’s 10th Major victory, the fourth Spaniard to win the Masters, and my second career Major title. It’s a pretty incredible feeling.

The history of the game is a big part of why I compete and one of the reasons why I play this game is because of the late Seve Ballesteros. If it wasn’t for the Ryder Cup at Valderrama in 1997, when he was the European team captain, I really don’t know where I would be or where, as a family, we would be today, as it was at that event my family fell in love and got involved with the game of golf.

For me to win the Masters on the 40th anniversary of Seve’s second Masters win, and also on what would have been his 66th birthday, and Easter Sunday, is so incredibly meaningful. To finish off the tournament the way I did with an unusual par, which is very much a Seve par, it was in a non-purposeful way, a testament to him.

I know Seve was pulling for me and this one is for Seve. He was up there helping, and help he did. There is a lot of pride in winning the Masters and I’m really proud of myself.

To play the way I did with only one bogey in the final round under difficult conditions and later coming in with a good lead – it is hard to explain. It still really hasn’t sunk in yet.

I also find it hard to believe I’m the first European golfer to win a US Open and Masters. If there’s anything better than accomplishing a feat like this, it is making golf history.

It is a very humbling feeling to know I accomplished something like this, considering the many great players who have come before me.

During the final round, I was calm despite starting two back of Brooks Koepka. I knew I needed to bring the fight to him. When I got to the fourth tee tied with Brooks, the goal was to keep giving him something to think about.

If I hit a good shot or have a birdie chance, I wanted him to see that and I wanted to keep putting the ball in the fairway and making good swings for him to feel more of the pressure rather than me. I felt I did that really, really well.

After I got the lead on the sixth, the goal at that point was to not come back to the rest of the field, and to have them chase me. I knew I could make a few birdies and pars on the back nine and it was going to be pretty difficult for someone to catch up, especially with the wind conditions.

My lead narrowed very, very quickly and it made the 10th, 11th and 12th holes a lot harder for me. I might have looked calm, but I was definitely nervous.

I’m glad that’s the way it looked. That’s what you strive for and you don’t want to panic when you’re fighting for the tournament. I felt comfortable with my game and I had a plan to execute.

I never allowed myself to get too frustrated. The only time I was a little upset was actually in the morning, during the conclusion of the third round on the 16th hole.

As I had three-putted 13th, three-putted 15th, and then hit a terrible shot on 16th and made a bogey, I felt like at least one of those shots was avoidable.

That was the only time I was truly upset. But I reeled it back in quickly and made two good pars on the last two holes to put myself in the final group, which was what I needed.

Walking up to the 18th tee box with a four-shot lead, I felt confident. I think it was karma as I was telling my caddie Adam (Hayes) how great I have been hitting a low fade the entire week.

And, of course, on 18, I hit an average drive which was maybe two feet from missing that tree on the right and fell well short of the fairway.

I guess it will be a good story in the future…. I won the Masters and didn’t even make it to the fairway on the 18th tee shot.

However, I’d rather want to remember my second shot on the 14th hole because, if there was a key moment throughout the day, it was that shot. To be able to hit it to four feet from being out of position was incredible.

I’ve always been confident when I’ve been close to the lead. I have full faith in all parts of my game. And maybe because we had difficult conditions, I was just so focused on what I had to do.

We’ve put in a lot of effort to try and beat the best guys in the world.

So maybe that level of intensity and that determination is what you see and that’s why I’m characterised as a fighter.

I’m really proud of myself for winning this.","A lot of it is because of what winning the Masters means to me, and to Spanish golf.

Abdul Rahman, also deputy works minister, said he acknowledges the concerns faced by motorists who will be returning to their hometowns for the weekend-long celebration through the existing Federal Route 8 which has been partially closed.

He said half of the two-lane dual carriageways has been closed to facilitate the construction of the ongoing Lingkaran Tengah Utama Expressway (LTU) and an alternative route has been made available to mitigate the traffic volume.

“The ministry and I take note of the concerns raised by road users who will be passing through Jalan Gua Musang.

“I view the matter seriously because motorists returning to Kelantan will utilise roads on the Lipis route, whereby if there is heavy traffic in Gua Musang, it will similarly affect the roads in Lipis as well.

“There are many risks posed towards motorists' risk if they insist on taking Jalan Gua Musang which is currently involved with the LTU project,” he said in a video posted on his Facebook page.

Abdul Rahman said if there were to be a pile-up accident or landslide on the existing road, the existing congestion would be exacerbated further.

“This detour is necessary because of ongoing road works and due to the high volume of vehicles set to travel on the road, a pile-up or landslide would cause major traffic congestion,” he said in the video.

He then apologised for the inconvenience and noted that the alternative route through Jalan Hospital-Jalan Jelawang-Jalan Gua Musang had been widened and is safe for use.

LTU Expressway, previously known as Central Spine Road is a new toll-free highway under construction in the centre of Peninsular Malaysia.

The LTU is a high-impact project under the Works Ministry, which involves six packages from Kelantan to Pahang covering a total of over 300km, with an allocation of RM10 billion.","“The ministry and I take note of the concerns raised by road users who will be passing through Jalan Gua Musang.

Milan smashed four goals past Italy’s runaway league leaders without reply earlier this month, but Pioli doesn’t think there is any chance of Napoli being rocked by that defeat in Wednesday’s first leg at the San Siro.

“The match in the league will obviously give us an idea, but there’s no way it will be the same match again,” said Pioli.

“They’re the highest scoring team in this Champions League and after Bayern Munich the team that have won the most matches so they’re a really good team with great quality.

“I think both teams have the same chance of going through. I’m expecting two very balanced matches... I think we can expect something different from Napoli so we need to be aware whether we need to make changes from the match in the league.”

Latest reports in Italy suggest Napoli will be without star striker Victor Osimhen, who did not take part in team training on Tuesday.

Osimhen, who has scored 25 goals in all competitions this season, also missed the league encounter with a thigh injury picked up on international duty.

“It doesn’t make a difference, Napoli have great players, they’re all good,” added Milan’s France full-back Theo Hernandez.

“Whether he plays or not, whoever is out there tomorrow will play their part.”

Napoli will be playing their first ever last-eight tie in the Champions League at a stadium which has seen a raft of memorable European nights.

Milan have been crowned continental kings more times than any other team bar Real Madrid and Pioli believes that playing such a huge game at a packed San Siro will have a positive impact on his team.

Both nations have reached a consensus to end their dispute over barley, they said on Tuesday, with Australia suspending a case at the World Trade Organisation while China hastens a review of tariffs on Australian exports.

“Making sure we do diversify our export markets is an important part of our national resilience,” Ms Wong told Sky News in a television interview on Wednesday. “And the government will continue to encourage that because we want to make sure we have diversified export markets.”

Trade worth A$285 billion (S$253 billion) a year continues with Australia’s major two-way trading partner, while thawing ties have seen Beijing wind back impediments placed on a raft of Australian commodity exports in 2020 amid a diplomatic dispute.

However, it was important to recognise the relationship between the two nations was “not going back to where we were 15 years ago”, Ms Wong said in media interviews.

“We know that we want a more stable relationship with China, but we know we’re not going to be able to continue to separate our economic and our strategic relationship,” she told Nine’s Today Show.

As China operates as a “great power in the world”, it was inevitable there would be areas where Australia and China did not have the same interests, she added.

Ms Wong called China’s recent military drills around Taiwan “destabilising”, adding: “We would urge de-escalation.” She told Sky News in the interview: “Australia’s position is, very clearly, no unilateral change to the status quo.” REUTERS","SYDNEY - Australia wants exporters to diversify their markets and become less reliant on China, because it cannot separate economic and strategic relationships, Foreign Minister Penny Wong said a day after the trade partners unveiled a path to ending a dispute.

The report — a collaboration between the Minnesota Indian Affairs Council and the university - found that the school developed and taught revisionist narratives intended to conceal the systemic harm perpetuated against Indigenous people.

“The Founding Board of Regents committed genocide and ethnic cleansing of Indigenous peoples for financial gain, using the institution as a shell corporation through which to launder lands and resources,” the report said.

The 500-page report was an outgrowth of the Truth Project, whose name is an acronym for “Towards Recognition and University-Tribal Healing.”

The project began in 2020 with the aim of revealing how universities across the United States were built on the proceeds of land taken away from tribes through the 1862 Morrill Act.

The University of Minnesota extracted vast amounts of wealth from tribes in the region, the project’s research team said on Tuesday. It said the founding members used their positions in government to pass anti-Indigenous legislation that financially benefited them and the institution.

The report urged the university to enact policies that benefit Indigenous people, including a combination of “reparations, truth-telling, policy change, and transformative justice processes.”

Robert Larsen, president of the Minnesota Indian Affairs Council, said the report only scratched the surface of local history, which was mostly ignored in schools or not known to the general public.

The US Congress in 2009 passed a resolution, tucked into an appropriations bill, that apologised to Native Americans for violence, maltreatment and neglect inflicted by U.S. citizens. In 2019, California Governor Gavin Newsom apologised to Native Americans for violence and other wrongdoings they suffered during the state’s history.

https://www.straitstimes.com/business/sugar-extends-surge-as-refined-contract-hits-highest-since-2011,Sugar extends surge as refined contract hits highest since 2011,"SAO PAULO – Sugar extended its surge in New York and London on mounting worries about tight supplies.

White sugar futures rose 2.7 per cent in London to settle at its highest price since November 2011. That elevated the white premium, the price difference between refined and raw sugar, which touched record highs in Tuesday trading before trimming gains.

Raw sugar settled 2.6 per cent higher in New York, its highest since October 2016.

A lack of deliverable sugar ahead of Friday’s expiry of the white sugar contract for May is driving prices higher.

The number of contracts to be closed, known as open interest, points to a “massive” delivery above 880,000 tonnes, said Mr John Stansfield, a senior sugar analyst at DNEXT Intelligence, adding that those with short positions “don’t have the physical sugar to tender”.

Prices of the sweetener have jumped on prospects for limited exports out of key shipper India and lackluster supplies from Thailand, Europe, China and Mexico.

India is one of the largest exporters of white sugar, but shipments are controlled by quotas that are almost exhausted, with no real expectation of an increase, said Mr Soren Jensen, a long-time market observer.

India’s refining industry might soon have to shift from domestically produced raw sugar to imports – most likely from Brazil.

The South American country just started its harvest, but transportation bottlenecks are an issue, with sugar competing against a record soya bean crop for space on railways and at ports.

“There is growing concern that Brazil might not export as much as expected in the beginning of the season, however the market really needs the Brazilian sugar,” Mr Jensen said. BLOOMBERG","White sugar futures rose 2.7 per cent in London to settle at its highest price since November 2011.

The spyware and related exploit or hacking software was created by a little-known company called QuaDream, which was established by a former Israeli military official and veterans of NSO Group, the creator of Pegasus, according to Citizen Lab.

Citizen Lab, which studies the abuse of digital technologies, said it identified at least five people targeted by QuaDream spyware and exploits in North America, Central Asia, South-east Asia, Europe and the Middle East.

“Victims include journalists, political opposition figures and an NGO (non-governmental organisation) worker,” it said, adding that it would not identify them at the moment.

Spyware like Pegasus has been widely used by governments and other actors to spy on opponents, the media and activists.

The programs can be placed on computers and cellphones by phishing communications and backdoor exploits, and can survey and transmit information on the phone back to an operator without the user’s knowledge.

The White House said in late March that Pegasus has been used by governments “to facilitate repression and enable human rights abuses”.

Citizen Lab said that once QuaDream’s spyware has been placed on a user’s phone or computer, it can record audio from a phone call, record external sounds from a device’s microphone, take pictures from cameras, and search the device’s files, all without the user’s knowledge.

It can also generate its own two-factor authentication codes to enable continual access to the device owner’s cloud accounts.

The spyware includes a self-destruct feature to hide its previous presence once it is no longer used, Citizen Lab said.

Citizen Lab identified servers in 10 countries that received data from victims’ devices, including Israel, Mexico, the United Arab Emirates and Bulgaria.

https://www.straitstimes.com/world/middle-east/iran-exploits-quake-relief-mission-to-fly-weapons-to-syria-sources,Iran exploits quake relief mission to fly weapons to Syria: Sources,"AMMAN - Iran has used earthquake relief flights to bring weapons and military equipment into its strategic ally Syria, nine Syrian, Iranian, Israeli and Western sources said.

The sources told Reuters that the goal was to buttress Iran’s defences against Israel in Syria and to strengthen Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

Reuters is the first to report this development.

After the Feb 6 earthquake in northern Syria and Turkey, hundreds of flights from Iran began landing in Syria’s Aleppo, Damascus and Latakia airports bringing supplies, and this went on for seven weeks, the sources said.

More than 6,000 people died in all of Syria, according to the United Nations.

The supplies included advanced communications equipment and radar batteries as well as spare parts required for a planned upgrade of Syria’s Iran-provided air defence system in its civil war, said the sources, two regional sources and a Western intelligence source said.

Reuters spoke to Western intelligence officials, sources close to the Iranian and Israeli leadership, as well as a Syrian military defector and a serving Syrian officer about the flights for this article.

When asked if Iran had used humanitarian relief planes after the earthquakes to move military equipment to Syria to enhance its network there and help Mr Assad, Iran’s mission to the UN in New York said: “That’s not true.”

Syria’s government did not respond to a request for comment.

Regional sources told Reuters that Israel quickly became aware of the flow of weapons into Syria and mounted an aggressive campaign to counter it.

Brigadier-General Yossi Kuperwasser, an insider and former head of research in the Israel army as well as ex-general director of the Ministry of Strategic Affair, said Israeli air strikes against the shipments relied on intelligence so specific that Israel’s military knew which truck in a long convoy to target.

An Israeli defence official, who asked to remain anonymous, told Reuters: “Under the guise of shipments of earthquake aid to Syria, Israel has seen significant movements of military equipment from Iran, mainly transported in parts.”

He said the aid was mainly delivered to Syria’s northern Aleppo airport.

Shipments were organised, the official said, by the Unit 18000 Syrian division of the Quds Force, the foreign espionage and paramilitary arm of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, led by Mr Hassan Mehdoui.

Ground transportation was handled by the Quds Force’s Transport Unit 190 led by Mr Bahanem Shahariri, he said.","AMMAN - Iran has used earthquake relief flights to bring weapons and military equipment into its strategic ally Syria, nine Syrian, Iranian, Israeli and Western sources said.

https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/tennis/dominic-thiem-at-full-power-after-recovering-from-wrist-injury,Dominic Thiem at full power after recovering from wrist injury,"MONTE CARLO – The lingering effects of a 2021 wrist injury limited Dominic Thiem’s ability to generate power last season but the former world No. 3 is happy that he can now rely on his big weapons again after making a strong start at the Monte Carlo Masters.

The Austrian broke the Grand Slam stranglehold of Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic by winning the 2020 US Open but the injury sidelined him for months and other niggles saw him slip down the rankings to No. 352 last June.

After a first-round exit at the Australian Open in January, and disappointing performances in the tournaments that followed, Thiem made the quarter-finals of the Estoril Open and beat Frenchman Richard Gasquet 6-1, 6-4 in his opener in Monaco.

“Some positive signs happened already in Estoril and today (Monday), I had the feeling that I was doing, from time to time, good damage with both forehand and backhand,” said Thiem, who next plays Holger Rune.

“The power wasn’t there last year even when I started to win matches and played better. In the inner season, the power wasn’t there yet. Also maybe not in the beginning of the year.

“In the last month, it’s coming back, especially in practice. The shots are there, the power is there like before, but I was using it wrong. There’s full trust again in the wrist and the forehand.”","MONTE CARLO – The lingering effects of a 2021 wrist injury limited Dominic Thiem’s ability to generate power last season but the former world No.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/one-five-americans-have-family-member-killed-guns-survey-3411666,One in five Americans have a family member killed by guns: Survey,"WASHINGTON: One in five American adults have a family member who was killed by a gun - including by suicide - and a similar percentage said they've been threatened with one, according to a survey released Tuesday (Apr 12).

Gun-related violence - including mass shootings, suicides and accidents - has become so common in the United States that 84 per cent of US adults say they have taken precautions to protect themselves and their families from the danger of being shot, according to health research group KFF, which released the survey.

More than one-third of those surveyed said they have avoided large crowds due to the possibility of gun violence. Some 29 per cent have bought firearms to protect themselves and their families.

The data was released one day after the latest mass shooting to hit the country, at a bank in Louisville, Kentucky, left five dead. Governor Andy Beshear said one of the victims was ""an incredible friend"" of his.

Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg detailed how he was shot at during his election campaign last year.

On Mar 27, three children and three adults were shot dead at a primary school in Nashville, Tennessee.

According to the Gun Violence Archive, 11,631 people have been killed by guns so far in 2023, including 4,965 by homicide, accidents and incidents of defensive gun use, and 6,666 by suicide.

In 2022, the organization said 20,249 people died in homicidal, accidental or defensive shootings. More than 24,000 used guns to kill themselves.

KFF said 41 per cent of American adults live in households where there is a gun present - and in 44 per cent of those homes, the weapon is kept in an unlocked location.

Black and Hispanic Americans reported far more experiences knowing someone who was shot, and generally feeling threatened by gun violence, than white Americans did.

Three out of 10 Black Americans had personally seen someone being shot, the survey said, more than twice the rate for white Americans.

KFF's data was based on a survey of 1,271 adults taken during mid-March.","WASHINGTON: One in five American adults have a family member who was killed by a gun - including by suicide - and a similar percentage said they've been threatened with one, according to a survey released Tuesday (Apr 12).

https://www.malaymail.com/news/world/2023/04/12/gang-related-shooting-in-ecuador-leaves-nine-dead/64353,Gang-related shooting in Ecuador leaves nine dead,"QUITO, April 12 — Assailants shot and killed nine people in northern Ecuador close to the Colombian border yesterday in an attack authorities blamed on organised crime gangs.

Dozens of attackers arrived in boats and cars at a small port in Esmeraldas province and then opened fire, the public prosecutor said.

Interior Minister Juan Zapata told the Ecuavisa television channel that the attack was carried out by 30 heavily armed people and said it was related to “a fight between gangs, a territorial fight.”

Zapata said there were between 1,500 and 2,000 people in the port, which is home to fishermen using artisanal techniques, at the time of the morning shooting.

The attack happened because fishermen “preferred the security” of one criminal organisation and were targeted by another in retaliation, added Zapata.

In a tweet, the public prosecutor said seven bodies were recovered from the port and two more from a nearby health center.

Impoverished Esmeraldas province has been under a state of emergency since March 3 due to high levels of crime and violence, as has the port city of Guayaquil.

These areas have become increasingly bloody centres of a turf war between rival drug trafficking gangs.

Esmeraldas, which is popular with tourists, is considered by authorities to be one of the places with the highest levels of crime in the country.

Last month, police found three bodies, including a teenager, wrapped in black bags in the province. Authorities said they were linked to criminal gangs.

“In three weeks here we have seized 1.2 tons of drugs,” said Zapata.

Surge in gang violence

Ecuador is located between Colombia and Peru, the world’s two largest producers of cocaine, much of which is sent to the United States and Europe from Ecuadoran ports, principally Guayaquil.

Consequently, Ecuador has seen a recent rise in violence and murders related to drug trafficking.

Its murder rate almost doubled from 14 per 100,000 citizens in 2021 to 25 a year later.

In 2021, Ecuador seized a record 210 tons of drugs, mainly cocaine.

Last year, another 200 tons of drugs were seized, leading to the government declaring a war on traffickers.

Guayaquil is one of the cities most affected by the surge in violence, as are prisons.

Since February 2021, there have been eight prison massacres in which more than 400 inmates have been killed, many dismembered or torched.

Gangs that vie for control of the lucrative trafficking trade have often controlled operations from within the prison system.

But it is also the scene of bloody battles between rival gangs. — AFP","QUITO, April 12 — Assailants shot and killed nine people in northern Ecuador close to the Colombian border yesterday in an attack authorities blamed on organised crime gangs.

With 100 days to go before co-hosting the World Cup with New Zealand, the Matildas returned to winning ways after their friendly defeat by Scotland on Friday thwarted a seventh straight win.

""I think most of all they (Australia) were very efficient. We gave them chances,"" Wiegman told ITV. ""In possession we were too slow. You need dynamic movement to stretch them, we didn't do that well enough.""

Kerr opened the scoring in the 32nd minute capitalising on a poor clearance by defender Leah Williamson to coolly slot home, despite appearing to be offside as there was no VAR in place.

""England's such a big footballing nation, hopefully there are some happy Aussies, but we're not getting ahead of ourselves,"" Kerr said.

Australia's counter-attacking play paid off and Grant doubled the lead in the 67th minute with a header that bounced off Williamson, who had a night to forget, and into the net.

""We looked like we lacked ideas on the ball, and we got punished. It was my mistake for first goal, and they were ruthless on counter,"" Williamson said.

""I'm not one for dwelling on personal things, that first goal has made it worse for me but the whole teams feels really rubbish about losing. It hurts.

""Absolutely not a setback (for the World Cup). For us to lose tonight gives us a bit of fire.""

The Lionesses pressed but could not find a way past a solid Australian defence, as they lost for the first time under Wiegman's tenure.

""This is the first time we lose, but we always learn,"" Wiegman added. ""We have to improve to be at our best at the World Cup. Every game is for learning, and this is a big one.""

The defeat in Antalya, Turkey extended the Football Ferns' winless run to 10 matches and heaps further pressure on embattled coach Jitka Klimková.

""It was disappointing, specifically in front of the goal,"" Klimkova said.

""We were not gritty enough in our defensive third. We gave up a goal from a set play. We gave up a goal from a cross.

""The biggest improvement we need to now look for is really gritty defending in the box and putting body on the line.""

Nigeria, ranked 42nd in the world, had goals from veteran defender Onome Ebi and Onyi Echegini on either side of the break, with substitute Désiré Oparanozie firing in a third in added time.

Hassett's injury added salt to 25th-ranked New Zealand's wounds, the midfielder forced from the field after 70 minutes after clashing with Oparanozie.

The injury comes after fellow midfielder Olivia Chance suffered an apparent knee injury in last week's 1-1 draw against Iceland, which saw the Football Ferns score their first goal since November.

However, developers’ interest in the estate has been on the decline and market experts are expecting cautious bidding amid an uncertain economic outlook.

The first private residential land parcel is a site at Lentor Central, launched for sale under the confirmed list of the Government Land Sales (GLS) programme for the first half of 2023.

The development, at around 158,263 sq ft, can be built up to five storeys and yield around 475 residential units. It is the sixth site launched under the GLS confirmed list.

The units are part of the 4,090 residential units to be made available under the GLS programme for the first half of 2023, which represents a 17 per cent increase from the 3,505 units released in the second half of 2022.

The tender for the Lentor Central site will close at 12pm on Sept 12.

The second land parcel is a residential site at Lentor Gardens, which is about 222,175 sq ft and can yield 500 units.

The site is only available for application by developers under the GLS reserve list, meaning it will be put up for tender only if the minimum price submitted by a developer is acceptable to the Government.

The two parcels are located within the new Lentor Hills estate near Lentor MRT Station along the Thomson-East Coast Line.

Also coming up in the area are retail outlets, a supermarket and childcare facilities within the nearby mixed-use development at Lentor Modern.

Huttons Asia senior director of research Lee Sze Teck said the number of bids has been declining, from nine for the site that is now Lentor Modern, sold in July 2021, to just one for a Lentor Gardens site launched in October 2022.

He attributed developers’ waning interest to the pipeline supply of almost 3,000 units in the area that will be completed over the next four to five years, if all six sites on the GLS confirmed list are sold.","The first private residential land parcel is a site at Lentor Central, launched for sale under the confirmed list of the Government Land Sales (GLS) programme for the first half of 2023.

https://www.straitstimes.com/business/fed-officials-signal-divide-over-whether-to-hike-rates-again,US Fed officials signal divide over whether to hike rates again,"HOUSTON – Federal Reserve officials sounded divergent notes about the central bank’s next policy move, with one of its top officials suggesting another rate increase may be needed to quell inflation and its newest policymaker signalling a pause may be in order.

New York Fed President John Williams said Tuesday that Fed officials still have more work to do to bring down prices, echoing remarks from his colleagues in recent days, and suggested they will stay the course despite new uncertainty from turmoil in the banking sector.

Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, who votes on monetary policy decisions this year, instead called for “prudence and patience” in assessing the economic impact of tighter credit conditions that are likely to stem from financial stress, the first official to suggest policymakers may need to hold off on further hikes for now.

“Given how uncertainty abounds about where these financial headwinds are going, I think we need to be cautious,” Mr Goolsbee said in prepared remarks at an event hosted by the Economic Club of Chicago. “We should gather further data and be careful about raising rates too aggressively until we see how much work the headwinds are doing for us in getting down inflation.”

Mr Williams, speaking earlier in an interview with Yahoo! Finance, said Fed officials’ median forecast in March projecting one more interest-rate hike this year, followed by a pause, is a “reasonable starting place” – though the path will depend on incoming economic data.

“We need to do what we need to do in order to make sure we bring inflation down,” Mr Williams said. Inflation is coming down but remains well above the Fed’s 2 per cent goal, he said.

Fed officials lifted interest rates by a quarter percentage point last month, bringing their policy benchmark to a target range of 4.75 per cent to 5 per cent, up from near zero a year earlier.

Forecasts last month showed the 18 officials expected rates to reach 5.1 per cent by year-end, according to their median projection. Investors bet the Fed will raise rates at its next meeting May 2-3, but will cut rates later this year – something officials have not projected.

Mr Williams said the market expectations reflect forecasts for recession as well as a sharper slowdown in inflation than what most officials anticipate.

“We’re seeing signs of inflation slowing, but inflation is still very high,” he said. “Some of this core services inflation, excluding housing, that hasn’t budged yet. So, still kind of got our work cut out for us to get inflation back to 2 per cent.”

A string of bank collapses last month has added new uncertainty to the outlook this year. Still, most Fed officials have continued to emphasise their commitment to bringing prices down.

Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, who also votes on policy this year, said last month that though it will take a while to see the full effects of the banking fallout, the Fed still has more work to do to lower inflation.

Mr James Bullard, Mr Goolsbee’s counterpart in St. Louis, said steps taken to ease financial strains were working and the central bank should keep raising interest rates to fight high inflation. And Cleveland Fed chief Loretta Mester said policymakers will need to raise rates “a little bit higher” and then hold them there for some time. Neither Ms Mester nor Mr Bullard votes in monetary policy decisions this year.

Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker, who votes on policy this year, sounded less emphatic than some of his colleagues on the need to take more measures against inflation.","Finance, said Fed officials’ median forecast in March projecting one more interest-rate hike this year, followed by a pause, is a “reasonable starting place” – though the path will depend on incoming economic data.

Pictures on social media showed Guterres being given a red carpet welcome at the capital city’s airport by Somalia’s Foreign Minister Abshir Omar Huruse and other leaders.

Somalia has imposed a security lockdown on Mogadishu for the unannounced visit, with most roads closed, and public transport restricted.

Guterres’s arrival comes as the country is in the grip of a calamitous drought that has driven many to the brink of famine, while the government is also engaged in a major offensive to put down a bloody Islamist insurgency.

The UN has launched a US$2.6 billion (RM11.4 billion) appeal for humanitarian aid for the troubled Horn of Africa nation, but it is currently only 13 per cent funded.

Five straight failed rainy seasons in parts of Somalia as well as Kenya and Ethiopia have led to the worst drought in four decades, wiping out livestock and crops and forcing at least 1.7 million people from their homes in search of food and water.

While famine thresholds have not been reached in Somalia, the United Nations says about half its population will need humanitarian assistance this year, with 8.3 million affected by the drought.

Lampard is back in charge of Chelsea until the end of the season after replacing the sacked Graham Potter last week.

After watching Chelsea crash to a lacklustre 1-0 defeat at Wolves in his first game in charge on Saturday, Lampard takes them to Real Madrid for a daunting Champions League quarter-final first leg tomorrow.

Chelsea are languishing in 11th place in the Premier League after a dismal campaign that included Thomas Tuchel being sacked in September and Potter lasting only seven months before his dismissal.

The west Londoners have managed to progress to the last eight in Europe despite their wretched domestic form.

Knocking out holders Real would be a major upset, but Lampard knows all about defying the odds in the Champions League.

Lampard captained Chelsea in their unexpected run to Champions League triumph 11 years ago.

The Blues finished sixth during an underwhelming top-fight season, with Roberto Di Matteo replacing the axed Andre Villas-Boas in March.

But in the Champions League they overturned a 3-1 first leg deficit to beat Napoli in the last 16, then recovered from 2-1 down on aggregate in the semi-final second leg to eliminate Lionel Messi’s Barcelona despite a red card for John Terry on a memorable night in the Camp Nou.

In the final against Bayern Munich, they needed a last-gasp equaliser from Didier Drogba to set up a penalty shoot-out victory over the Germans in their own Allianz Arena stadium.

Repeating that fairytale success seems beyond Chelsea as they board their flight to Madrid, but Lampard insists anything can happen if his players show enough desire.

‘One of the best in the world’

“There’s a lot to it. Part of that was we parked the bus at the Nou Camp and managed to hang on for our dear lives! There are so many things, fate in different moments,” he said.

“But we did have a huge desire and a big character and a level of talent in the group that have been striving for years to win a Champions League, so that one you remember.

“A team and a group will always go through tough moments to get to great ones.”

Chelsea are without a win in their last four games and once again lacked a cutting edge in the Wolves defeat.

If Lampard’s men are stun Real in the Bernabeu, the Blues boss could do with a rare influential display from Raheem Sterling.

The England forward has struggled badly since his move from Manchester City last year.

Lampard recalled Sterling to face Wolves but there was little sign of the pace and trickery that made him such a force during his time at City.

Sterling, who has scored just seven times this term, did grab a crucial goal in the Champions League last 16 second leg win against Borussia Dortmund and Lampard believes he can still have a positive impact on Chelsea’s fortunes.

“Raheem has been there and done it and there’s history of producing,” Lampard said. “He’s been one of the best wingers in the world for a long time, at times, maybe in some people’s opinion, the best.

“He’s risen to games like that before in the past so that’s something we’ll obviously rely on in terms of this because some elements of the squad are maybe a bit younger.

“This game won’t faze him. I can’t remember how many times I’ve told young wingers; ‘watch Raheem Sterling and see why he scores 20 goals a season’. I just think he’s a top player.” — AFP","LONDON, April 11 — Frank Lampard has urged Chelsea to ignore the turmoil enveloping his struggling side as he invoked the memory of the Blues’ incredible run to Champions League glory in 2012.

The capital Beijing has seen regular air pollution and an unseasonal number of sandstorms over the past few weeks.

Forecasters issued a blue weather alert warning for sandstorms. China has a four-tier, color-coded weather-warning system, with red representing the most severe warning and blue the least severe.

On Tuesday morning, smog and misty grey clouds could be seen enveloping Beijing and the city's real-time air quality index was at a serious pollution level, according to the website of the Beijing Municipal Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Center.

The concentration of fine particulates in the air in Beijing is currently 46.2 times the World Health Organization's annual air quality guideline value, according to IQAir, a website that issues air quality data and information.

A dozen provinces, including Shaanxi, Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan and Hubei, Inner Mongolia and metropolis Shanghai, will be affected by sandstorms and major dust until 8am on Wednesday, the Central Meteorological Observatory said.

The sandstorms were again a hot discussion topic on Weibo, China's Twitter-like social media platform, racking up 2.178 million chats.

One user wrote, ""What! When I wake up, why doesn't anyone issue a holiday notice, do you still have to go to work in the dust today!""

Beijing has regular sandstorms in March and April as it is near the large Gobi desert.

A Chinese government official at the Ministry of Ecology and Environment recently said the number of sandstorms was now four times higher than in the 1960s, a consequence of rising temperatures and lower precipitation in the deserts of north China and neighbouring Mongolia.","Thick sandstorms will hit Beijing and several provinces through Wednesday (Apr 12), and Chinese forecasters have advised citizens of respiratory dangers and very low visibility while travelling, state media reported.

Senior Ukrainian military officials did not address the claims directly, but said their forces were holding firm against fierce attacks in what once was a city of 70,000 and keeping Russian forces in check.

Wagner fighters have led Russia's months-long efforts to capture Bakhmut. The grinding trench warfare and constant artillery barrages have drawn comparisons with World War One because of massive casualties inflicted on both sides.

Wagner head Yevgeny Prigozhin said his forces, who have played a major role in Russian advances in the east, were pressing on with their encirclement of Bakhmut. ""In Bakhmut, the larger part, more than 80 per cent is now under our control, including the whole administrative centre, factories, warehouses, the administration of the city,"" he said in a video posted by a Russian military blogger.

The Russian-installed head of Donetsk region, one of four areas declared annexed by Moscow last September, said Russian forces had backed Ukrainian defenders into a corner.

""In the western areas where their units are dug in, they have no choice other than coming forward and giving themselves up,"" Russian news agencies quoted Denis Pushilin as telling state television.

Serhiy Cherevatyi, a spokesman for Ukraine's Eastern Military Command, said the situation in Bakhmut was under control, adding Kyiv would not allow its troops to be encircled.

Deputy Ukrainian Defence Minister Hanna Malyar acknowledged that Bakhmut ""took the main hit"" in fighting. But Russian forces, she said, ""are generally losing to us in street battles so they are simply destroying all buildings and structures"".

Kyiv says it needs more and better Western weapons to beat Russia, and senior Ukrainian officials pressed ahead with their bid to persuade allies to open up stockpiles.","The head of Russia's Wagner mercenary group on Tuesday (Apr 11) said his forces controlled more than 80% of the devastated eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut after some of war's heaviest and bloodiest fighting.

https://www.malaymail.com/news/life/2023/04/12/how-the-hot-glue-gun-became-the-ultimate-beauty-accessory-video/64376,How the hot glue gun became the ultimate beauty accessory (VIDEO),"NEW YORK, April 12 ― Somewhat incredibly, the hot glue gun ― most often used for small DIY jobs or creative hobbies ― has become a beauty must-have in recent weeks as a go-to tool for making three-dimensional shapes to craft creative ― and fun ― makeup looks.

Have you ever heard of 'hot glue gun makeup,' the beauty trend that's currently sweeping social networks? If you haven't, then you're about to. Now all the rage, this new makeup inspiration is gathering fans on Instagram and TikTok, with no less than 460,000 views for the #hotgluegunmakeup hashtag on the Chinese social network. So forget traditional eyeliner ― now far too dull for TikTokers ― and get ready to embrace more creative looks worthy of the most glamorous red carpets. In fact, this trend is characterised by its playfulness, since it involves creating three-dimensional shapes of all kinds, and then sticking them onto your face, but ― and this is the important bit ― not just in any way.

The hot glue gun as the latest makeup must-have

Surprising as it may seem, this new beauty trend doesn't require brushes, mascara wands or sponges, but simply a hot glue gun. More often associated with do-it-yourself jobs and creative crafts, this tool had never before made the grade as a beauty staple ― except perhaps among professional makeup artists. Still, that was without counting on the endless imagination and boundless creativity of TikTok users when it comes to experimenting with new techniques. For several weeks, they've been using the hot glue gun as a go-to accessory for their makeup looks. The #hotgluegun hashtag has already exceeded 27 million views on the Chinese social network, and this is just the beginning.

So what purpose can a hot glue gun serve in a makeup session? The answer is simple: it's all about standing out, and embracing a more creative makeup look than ever. That's because the DIY tool is being used to create eyeliner shapes and other three-dimensional elements to craft beauty looks as sophisticated as those worn by Doja Cat, Charli XCX or even Beyoncé. That's it! And it's easy to achieve, so long as you follow a few rules and ― especially ― take a few precautions.

Don't use the glue gun directly on skin

While this trend might not be to everyone's taste, if only because of the equipment it requires, it's nevertheless within everyone's reach. It is, of course, necessary to get a hot glue gun, but these widely available and affordable. In addition, you'll need a metal plate, plus eye shadow or nail powder, as well as false eyelash glue. Once you've got all the tools and products, it's time to get to work ― or almost. Because before doing anything, it's important to understand that a hot glue gun must never ― ever ― be used in direct contact with the skin ― i.e. don't put the hot glue directly onto your face. Now that's totally clear, you can get started with this fun and creative technique.

Just grab your hot glue gun and the metal plate ― essentially a palette that makeup artists use to mix colours ― and then start making 3D shapes with the glue. Unless you handle the tool like a pro, it will probably take several tries before you get the shapes you want, but it's just a matter of practice, and patience. Then let the glue dry for several minutes, cover the shape with nail powder or eyeshadow, and then fix it to the face, usually the eyelids, with false eyelash glue. Et voilà!

Having gone viral, this trend has given rise to another trick on the Chinese social network. Called chrome makeup, its hashtag already has no less than 22 million views. This is a playful inspiration that seems to come straight from the 2000s and could shape up to be one of the makeup trends of the year. ― ETX Studio","Have you ever heard of 'hot glue gun makeup,' the beauty trend that's currently sweeping social networks?

https://www.straitstimes.com/business/banking/imf-says-more-flexible-boj-yield-control-can-prevent-market-whiplash,IMF says more flexible BOJ yield control can prevent market whiplash,"TOKYO – The Bank of Japan (BOJ) could help prevent abrupt policy changes later by allowing more flexibility in its bond yield curve control, the International Monetary Fund said in its global financial stability report released on Tuesday.

Under yield curve control (YCC), the BOJ guides the 10-year government bond yield around 0 per cent as part of efforts to sustainably achieve its 2 per cent inflation target.

The central bank’s decision in December to widen the tolerance band around the yield target has heightened market bets of a further near-term tweak or end to YCC.

Changes to the BOJ’s yield control policy may affect financial markets through exchange rates, term premiums on sovereign bonds and global risk premiums, the IMF said.

“While allowing more flexibility in the yield curve control policy could have some repercussions in global financial markets, such a change not only is warranted to meet monetary policy objectives but could also help prevent abrupt policy changes later that could trigger larger spillovers,” the IMF said in the report.

The BOJ has kept policy ultra-loose even as other major economies hiked interest rates to combat soaring inflation, on the view the recent cost-driven price growth will not be sustained unless accompanied by stronger economic and wage growth.

While the yield control policy has helped keep borrowing costs low, it has come under increasing criticism for distorting market pricing and crushing financial institutions’ profits.

The BOJ’s new governor, Mr Kazuo Ueda, stressed on Monday his resolve to keep ultra-low interest rates for now, brushing aside lingering market expectations of a near-term policy shift.

In the report’s section analysing the potential impact of a tweak to YCC, the IMF said a further rise in Japanese long-term interest rates could affect bond yields of Australia, several euro-area countries and the United States as Japanese investors repatriate the huge amount of funds parked in these markets.

Some emerging markets like Indonesia and Malaysia could also face “material” capital outflows due to the significant presence of Japanese investors, it said.

“The pace and possible effects of repatriation could be larger, however, should market participants be surprised by the Bank of Japan’s announcements and actions,” the report said.

“Clear communication in the event of adjustments to the Bank of Japan’s monetary policy is critical to avoid market volatility,” it said.

Stuart said this is because Zii Jia, who is ranked fourth in the world, is the country’s best singles player currently and thus it is not appropriate to leave him out even though he has his own past history.

According to him, Zii Jia’s involvement also shows the openness of the RTG project in ensuring that appropriate support is given to any athlete who has the potential to win the country’s first gold medal at the Olympic Games.

“Zii Jia is currently ranked fourth in the world, basically we cannot overlook Zii Jia... I think his inclusion should not be questioned because he is the number one singles player in Malaysia.

“We know that he may have historical occurrences that may be in the memory of many but the matter is being resolved to ensure that Zii Jia’s chances at the Olympics are open,” he said when met at the Malaysian Football League’s (MFL) breaking of the fast programme at a hotel here yesterday.

Stuart, who is also MFL Chief Executive Officer (CEO), said this when asked if Zii Jia is still considered the best candidate to bring home the country’s first gold at the Olympic Games.

Previously, there were some negative impressions, among them that Zii Jia should not be included in the RTG project since he is a professional athlete and has sponsors.

Commenting further, Stuart said the inclusion of Zii Jia and that of other national professional badminton players has been approved by the Badminton Association of Malaysia (BAM).

“Tan Sri Mohamad Norza Zakaria (BAM president) himself submitted the names of these professional athletes to ensure that opportunities are also given to them,” he said.

Besides Zii Jia, three professional doubles pairs, two from the mixed doubles camp, Tan Kian Meng-Lai Pei Jing and Goh Soon Huat-Shevon Lai Jemie and men’s doubles, Ong Yew Sin-Teo Ee Yi ,are among the total of 15 athletes listed in the RTG project .

On Saturday, Zii Jia, who is also the 2021 All England champion, expressed his desire to win the country’s first gold at the Olympic Games during a meeting with Youth and Sports Minister Hannah Yeoh and Stuart in Kuala Lumpur.

The RTG project introduced by the Ministry of Youth and Sports (KBS) last month is considered a national project with the objective of coordinating the country’s efforts in hunting for the maiden gold medal at the Olympic Games covering the Paris 2024 and Los Angeles 2028 editions. — Bernama","PETALING JAYA, April 12 — The inclusion of national professional men’s singles shuttler Lee Zii Jia in the Road To Gold (RTG) project should not be questioned, said the project’s coordinator Stuart Ramalingam.

Data for March is expected to show a 7 per cent fall in exports from a year earlier, bigger than the 6.8 per cent drop recorded during the January-February period in which the Lunar New Year holiday fell and workers downed tools.

Such a result would add to policymakers' concerns about China's fragile economic recovery. The trade data will be released on Thursday.

Exports have struggled in the months following China's decision to drop its COVID curbs in December, when the world's second-largest economy re-opened. Once a major driver of economic strength, exports have not risen for five months.

Imports in March are expected to have fallen 5 per cent from a year earlier, improving on the 10.2 per cent drop seen in the January-February period, but continuing to reflect weak foreign demand, since the country brings in parts and materials from abroad for inputs in many of its exports.

Newly appointed premier Li Qiang told a cabinet meeting last week that officials should ""try every method"" to grow trade with developed economies and encourage companies to further explore emerging market economies, such as those in Southeast Asia.

New export order gauges in both official and private-sector factory activity surveys fell in March, with the Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing purchasing managers' index dropping back below the 50-point line that separates expansion and contraction.

China is not alone in its trade woes. Other Asian exporters such as South Korea and Vietnam have also seen exports decline in the first few months of 2023.

South Korean exports to China, a leading indicator of China's imports, were 33.4 per cent lower in March than a year earlier, the sharpest drop in over 14 years and extending losses to a 10th straight month.","BEIJING : China's exports and imports likely extended their declines in March, a Reuters poll showed on Wednesday, as weakening global demand squeezed factory supply chains and order books.

Although the three-day exercises, which ended Monday (Apr 10), were not as intense as those that unfolded in August 2022 in protest of then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taipei, China used them to show off its capabilities in the air and sea - both of which it would need to control if it attempted a blockade.

Here are the key takeaways from the drills.

CARRIER OPERATIONS

Many analysts noted the jets flying off the Shandong aircraft carrier, which took up position east of Taiwan, about 230km south of Japan's Miyajima island.

The carrier's presence there meant China ""can shatter Taiwan's so-called eastern shield"", Zhao Xiaozhuo, a senior colonel and researcher with People's Liberation Army Academy of Military Sciences, told state news agency Xinhua.

Beijing could not operate carriers with impunity in that area during a conflict, analysts said, especially if nations friendly to Taiwan were involved, but added that Taiwan would struggle to deal with such a threat on its own.

Chieh Chung, a military researcher at the Taipei-based National Policy Foundation think tank, said in the event of a attack, Taiwan would likely withdraw its military assets from the west to bases in the east, shielded by the island's high mountains and equipped with underground tunnels.

But an unfettered, more coordinated attack from the east would mean ""the whole situation will turn very unfavourable,"" he said.","BEIJING/TAIPEI: China's latest military drills near Taiwan show it is serious about being able to cut off the democratically ruled island in a conflict, analysts said, as Beijing said its aircraft carriers could ""shatter"" defences from the east.

https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/tennis/djokovic-recovers-from-stuttering-start-to-reach-monte-carlo-round-three,Djokovic recovers from stuttering start to reach Monte Carlo round three,"MONTE CARLO - Novak Djokovic briefly ran into a spot of bother as he fought his way into the third round of the Monte Carlo Masters with a 7-6(5) 6-2 victory against Russian qualifier Ivan Gakhov on Tuesday.

The world number one, who had not played since early March when he reached the final in Dubai after being forced to skip Indian Wells and Miami because of his Covid-19 unvaccinated status, struggled to find his range on the Monte Carlo clay before prevailing on a sunlit centre court.

Gakhov went for his shots and claimed the first service break to lead 4-3, only for the Serbian to break right back and take the opening set by winning the tiebreak 7-5.

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was 0.17 per cent lower in choppy trading. Japan's Nikkei was 0.49 per cent higher, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 index rose 0.65 per cent.

China shares were mixed at the open, with the Shanghai Composite Index up 0.1 per cent while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index lost 0.02 per cent. Data yesterday showed China's consumer inflation in March was at its slowest since September 2021.

After Friday's jobs report showed a resilient US labour market, emboldening bets of a 25 basis point hike at the Fed's next meeting in May, investor attention is firmly on the March inflation report due later in the day.

The consumer price index is expected to show core inflation rose 0.4 per cent on a monthly basis and 5.6 per cent year-over-year in March, according to a Reuters poll of economists.

“Investors are hopeful that Wednesday's inflation data could signal that the Federal Reserve was getting near the end of its rate hike cycle,” said Harry Ottley, an economist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia, noting focus continues to shift from banking wobbles in March back to the inflation problem.

Markets are now pricing in a 66 per cent chance of the Fed raising interest rates by 25 basis points in May and then pausing for the subsequent meetings, according to the CME FedWatch tool.

Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank President Patrick Harker yesterday said he feels the US central bank may soon be done raising interest rates, but reiterated the desire to bring inflation back to its 2 per cent target.

The Fed last month raised interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point, taking it to a range of 4.75 per cent to 5.00 per cent.

Minutes of its March meeting are due to be released later in the day and investors will parse through it for clues on the monetary path of the central bank as well as the impact of the banking stresses in March.

The turmoil in the banking sector had spurred some expectations that the Fed may need to cut interest rates to alleviate some of the stress in the market but a sticky inflationary environment is unlikely to give the Fed much room.

“Investors seem to be getting ahead of themselves in expecting the Fed to begin cutting interest rates”, said Luca Paolini, chief strategist at Pictet Asset Management.

Like other central banks, the Fed's hands are tied ― a high inflation rate will prevent it from providing monetary stimulus in the coming months, Paolini said in a note.

The International Monetary Fund warned yesterday that lurking financial system vulnerabilities could erupt into a new crisis and slam global growth this year as it lowered its 2023 global growth forecasts.

In the currency market, the dollar index, which measures the US currency against six rivals fell 0.049 per cent. The euro was up 0.12 per cent at US$1.0923, while sterling was last trading at US$1.2431, up 0.06 per cent on the day.

The yen strengthened 0.04 per cent to 133.63 per dollar. The IMF said the Bank of Japan could help prevent abrupt policy changes later by allowing more flexibility in its bond yield curve control.

Changes to the BOJ's yield control policy may affect financial markets through exchange rates, term premiums on sovereign bonds and global risk premiums, the IMF said.

US crude rose 0.07 per cent to US$81.59 (RM360.36) per barrel and Brent was at US$85.73, up 0.14 per cent on the day.

https://www.malaymail.com/news/tech-gadgets/2023/04/12/report-twitter-working-on-ai-despite-musk-call-for-global-pause/64378,Report: Twitter working on AI despite Musk call for global pause,"SAN FRANCISCO, April 12 ― Elon Musk is advancing an artificial intelligence project at Twitter despite recently calling for an overall pause in developing such technology, US media reports said yesterday.

Musk has bought thousands of powerful, costly computing processors and hired AI engineering talent, Insider reported, while another tech-focused outlet, the Information, said the entrepreneur has floated the idea of starting a rival to ChatGPT.

Meanwhile, Musk has slashed staff at Twitter as part of dramatic cost cutting since his $44 billion takeover of the San Francisco firm late last year.

The Insider report came less than two weeks after Musk joined experts in signing a letter calling for a hiatus in the development of AI.

The open letter, published on the website of the Musk-funded Future of Life Institute, urged a six-month pause in development of powerful AI systems.

The billionaire Tesla boss and other luminaries wrote that “AI systems with human-competitive intelligence can pose profound risks to society and humanity.”

The signatories, who included academics and tech titans like Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, argued that the pause should be used to bolster regulation and ensure the systems were safe.

Critics however called the letter a “hot mess” of “AI hype” that even misrepresented an academic paper.

Musk's fledgling AI project at Twitter was said in the Insider report to involve training a language model to create written content.

Generative AI could also be put to work as a search or advertising tool, but it remained unclear what Musk intended its purpose to be at Twitter, the report said.

Twitter replied to a request for comment with a poop emoji, which has become its practice under Musk.

Big tech companies like Google, Meta and Microsoft have spent years working on AI systems ― previously known as machine learning or big data ― to help with translations, search and targeted advertising.

But late last year San Francisco firm OpenAI supercharged the interest in AI when it launched ChatGPT, a bot that can generate screeds of natural language text from a short prompt.

Musk cofounded OpenAI but left the company in 2018.

Microsoft has since announced it is investing billions of dollars in OpenAI and put its technology to work in its Bing internet search service. ― AFP","SAN FRANCISCO, April 12 ― Elon Musk is advancing an artificial intelligence project at Twitter despite recently calling for an overall pause in developing such technology, US media reports said yesterday.

The state of emergency will be backed by initial funding of €5 million (US$5.45 million), the ministry for sea and civil protection said, and will last for six months.

""Let it be clear, we are not solving the problem, the solution can only depend on responsible intervention by the European Union,"" said Nello Musumeci, the civil protection minister.

The measure will allow Giorgia Meloni's right-wing government to more quickly repatriate those not allowed to stay in Italy, boosting identification and expulsion orders, a government source said.

The government, in office since October, has pledged to curb mass immigration but some 31,300 migrants have arrived in Italy so far in 2023, interior ministry data shows, up from around 7,900 in the same period last year.

On Monday, the coastguard led rescue operations involving two boats carrying a total of 1,200 people, with charity groups also joining efforts to save lives at sea.

Following a deadly shipwreck off the southern Italian region of Calabria in late February, Meloni urged the European Union to do more to halt illegal immigration, as she toughened jail terms for human smugglers.

https://www.malaymail.com/news/tech-gadgets/2023/04/12/china-to-require-security-assessment-for-new-ai-products/64366,China to require 'security assessment' for new AI products,"SHANGHAI, April 12 ― New AI products developed in China will have to undergo a security assessment before being released and must reflect “core socialist values”, a sweeping new draft law by the country's internet regulator showed yesterday.

The fresh regulations come as a flurry of Chinese companies rush to develop artificial intelligence services that can mimic human speech since San Francisco-based OpenAI launched ChatGPT in November, sparking a gold rush in the market.

Rapid advancements in AI have stoked global alarm over the technology's potential for disinformation and misuse, with deepfake images and people shown mouthing things they never said.

“Before providing services to the public that use generative AI products, a security assessment shall be applied for through national internet regulatory departments,” the draft law, released by the Cyberspace Administration of China, reads.

The draft law ― dubbed “Administrative Measures for Generative Artificial Intelligence Services” ― aims to ensure “the healthy development and standardised application of generative AI technology”, it read.

AI-generated content, it continued, needs to “reflect core socialist values, and must not contain content on subversion of state power”.

It must also not contain, among other things, “terrorist or extremist propaganda”, “ethnic hatred” or “other content that may disrupt economic and social order.”

The Cyberspace Administration of China said it was seeking public input on the contents of the new regulations, which under Beijing's highly centralised political system are almost certain to become law.

'Strictest so far'

“The new CAC draft document is one of the strictest measures for generative AI so far,” Andy Chun, adjunct professor at City University of Hong Kong, told AFP.

Companies submitting security assessments will need to “be very careful to ensure each data source used for AI learning must be within guidelines, accurate, unbiased, and not infringe on IP rights of others,” he said.

“Ensuring accuracy is hard. No generative AI system to date can do that,” said Chun.

The regulatory crackdown comes as China's tech giants ramp up their efforts in the closely-watched sector.

Alibaba's cloud computing unit yesterday unveiled its own product called Tongyi Qianwen, which is expected to be rolled out across the tech giant's office workplace communications software and household appliances.

CEO Daniel Zhang said in a statement that the software came in a “technological watershed moment driven by generative AI and cloud computing”.

And Baidu ― which operates the country's leading search engine ― released its own “Ernie Bot” AI chat product last month.

But investors were unimpressed by the bot's display of linguistic and maths skills at an unveiling, sending shares falling by as much as 10 percent.

ChatGPT is unavailable in China, but the American software is also gaining a base of Chinese users who use virtual private networks to get around the ban, deploying it to write essays and cram for exams.

And a 24-year-old Shanghai blogger caused a stir this month when he used AI technology to “resurrect” his dead grandmother, producing lifelike imagery of his interactions with the deceased relative.

Beijing has announced ambitious plans to become a global leader in the field of AI by 2030, and consultancy group McKinsey estimates the sector could add about US$600 billion every year to China's gross domestic product by then.

But it has also warned that deepfakes present a “danger to national security and social stability”.

Beijing in January enforced new rules that would require businesses offering deepfake services to obtain the real identities of their users. They also require deepfake content to be appropriately tagged to avoid “any confusion”. ― ETX Studio","SHANGHAI, April 12 ― New AI products developed in China will have to undergo a security assessment before being released and must reflect “core socialist values”, a sweeping new draft law by the country's internet regulator showed yesterday.

Second-half goals from Nicolo Barella and Romelu Lukaku saw the Italian outfit take a giant step towards the last four while leaving the Portuguese league leaders with it all to do.

""Being 2-0 down at home is not good, but we are at halftime in the tie,” Schmidt told reporters at the Estadio da Luz. ""Of course we can go to Milan to win.

“We had good moments but we also had bad luck with the penalty and we could have had a penalty or two ourselves. It's football.""

Barella scored with a powerful header in a sweeping attacking move to give Inter a deserved 51st minute lead but Benfica skipper Joao Mario was unfortunate to give away the penalty with a handball in the 82nd.

""It was a tough game. I think both teams had their chances. We didn't take advantage of ours, unfortunately,” added German-born Schmidt.

“We stayed in the game, the players gave everything. We created good moments, but we conceded the second goal from the penalty spot. That's the story of the game.”

Tuesday’s loss was only the third of the season for Benfica but their second in a row. They lost 2-1 at home to closest challengers Porto in the league last Friday, which cut their runaway lead in the standings to seven points.

No reason was specified for his withdrawal.

The RBC Heritage is a designated event, meaning players ranked in the top 20 of the Player Impact Programme (PIP) are required to participate.

The PIP was created to reward golfers for boosting engagement and publicity in the PGA Tour.

Players are allowed to skip one designated event for personal or professional reasons, but McIlroy already sat out of the season-opening Sentry Tournament of Champions in January.

A second absence from a designated event could potentially cost him his bonus money from the PIP, which is distributed at the end of the season.

The Northern Irishman’s bid for a career Grand Slam ended when he shot a disappointing second-round 77. Heading into the Masters, he was seen as a strong favourite to win his first green jacket at Augusta National.

The year’s first Major was won by Spaniard Jon Rahm, who regained the world No. 1 ranking.

McIlroy, who captured the last of his four Majors in 2014, had been hoping to win the Masters so that he could join Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player and Tiger Woods as the only players to achieve the career Slam.

The 33-year-old will not be replaced by an alternate, according to the PGA Tour, with the field reduced to 143 players for the tournament on Hilton Head Island, where three-time Major winner Jordan Spieth is the defending champion.","LOS ANGELES – Rory McIlroy has withdrawn from this week’s RBC Heritage event at Harbour Town, the PGA Tour said on Monday, after the world No.

https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/british-doctors-strikes-risk-patient-safety-minister-says,British doctors’ strikes risk ‘unparalleled disruption’ to patient safety,"LONDON - Junior doctors in Britain began a four-day strike over pay on Tuesday that is likely to cause unprecedented disruption to the state-funded National Health Service (NHS), prompting the government to warn of a risk to patient safety.

Tens of thousands of junior doctors – qualified physicians who make up nearly half of the medical workforce – are striking for pay rises better aligned with inflation, in a walkout that follows a three-day doctors’ strike in March.

“This latest round of strikes will see unparalleled levels of disruption, and we are very concerned about the potential severity of impact on patients and services across the country,” NHS England national medical director Stephen Powis said.

“We’ve also asked (hospitals) to reschedule procedures and outpatients as quickly as possible, but this will take weeks to recover from,” Mr Powis told BBC Radio, adding that the NHS was working to ensure emergency services were kept intact.

The chief of the NHS Confederation, which represents organisations across the healthcare sector, told Sky News he expected up to 350,000 appointments to be cancelled during the four-day strike.

The strike is the latest to involve NHS staff, following walkouts by nurses, paramedics and others demanding rises that better reflect annual inflation running at more than 10 per cent.

It comes as the NHS experiences one of its most severe crises in its 75-year-history, overwhelmed with some 7 million patients waiting for hospital treatment, severely affecting areas such as cardiovascular care.

British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has made cutting hospital waiting times one of his major priorities amid eroding public satisfaction with an institution that has long been a source of national pride.

The British Medical Association (BMA), the union representing doctors, wants a 35 per cent rise, arguing that members have suffered a 26 per cent real terms cut in pay over 15 years.

The BMA has said the strikes by junior doctors, some of whom are very experienced, could be stopped if Health Minister Steve Barclay put a credible pay offer forward.

“Not only will the walkouts risk patient safety, but they have also been timed to maximise disruption after the Easter break,” Mr Barclay said in a statement.

He says the BMA’s demands are unreasonable and would mean an increase of more then £20,000 (S$33,000) for some doctors.

The doctors have joined hundreds of thousands of other public sector workers who have gone on strike in Britain, including railway staff, teachers and civil servants.

Disputes in some sectors have been resolved in recent weeks. REUTERS","LONDON - Junior doctors in Britain began a four-day strike over pay on Tuesday that is likely to cause unprecedented disruption to the state-funded National Health Service (NHS), prompting the government to warn of a risk to patient safety.
Tens of thousands of junior doctors – qualified physicians who make up nearly half of the medical workforce – are striking for pay rises better aligned with inflation, in a walkout that follows a three-day doctors’ strike in March.
“This latest round of strikes will see unparalleled levels of disruption, and we are very concerned about the potential severity of impact on patients and services across the country,” NHS England national medical director Stephen Powis said.
The BMA has said the strikes by junior doctors, some of whom are very experienced, could be stopped if Health Minister Steve Barclay put a credible pay offer forward.
“Not only will the walkouts risk patient safety, but they have also been timed to maximise disruption after the Easter break,” Mr Barclay said in a statement.",2023-04-11 07:34:07+08:00
https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/taiwan-election-shapes-up-with-tsai-s-party-set-to-tap-candidate,Taiwan election shapes up with Tsai’s party set to tap candidate William Lai,"TAIPEI – Mr William Lai Ching-te’s mother was bitterly disappointed when the Harvard-educated doctor told her in the 1990s that he was giving up his medical career to enter politics.

She might forgive him now: As Taiwan’s vice-president, Mr Lai is expected to be named on Wednesday as the ruling Democratic Progressive Party’s candidate in the 2024 presidential election, a vote being watched more closely than ever, from Washington to Beijing.

With US-China tensions increasingly centred around Taiwan, the self-governing island Beijing claims as its own, the winner of the January 2024 election will immediately step into a role that could determine the trajectory of geopolitics and the global economy for years to come.

Since taking office in 2016, President Tsai Ing-wen’s rejection of the idea that Taiwan is just a part of China has often drawn criticism from an increasingly aggressive Beijing while earning the praise of policymakers from both political parties in Washington.

Ms Tsai’s recent stops in the United States, where she met House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and was feted at an awards ceremony in New York, underscore the growing strength of US-Taiwan relations.

“I believe our bond is stronger now than at any time or point in my lifetime,” Mr McCarthy told reporters after the meeting, held at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California.

But the US also has uneasy memories of a previous Taiwanese president, Mr Chen Shui-bian, who frayed nerves in Washington with his unpredictable rhetoric and more robust push to cement Taiwan’s de facto independence.

While Mr Lai, 63, insists he shares the same stance on Taiwan’s political status as Ms Tsai, arguing that the island is already “an independent country” – although largely unrecognised – and that there is no need to declare independence, some of his past comments have generated concern.

During his time as premier in 2017, he described himself as a worker for Taiwan’s independence. It appears to be a long-held view. During a visit to Shanghai’s Fudan University in 2014, when he was the mayor of Tainan city, he said independence was a consensus view in Taiwanese society.

Not surprisingly, China has been critical of his views. In 2019, Beijing’s Taiwan Affairs Office described his pro-independence comments as “arrogant”, saying they “aim to fire-up cross-strait confrontation and endanger the peaceful status on the Taiwan Straits”. The office’s then spokesman Ma Xiaoguang said Mr Lai’s actions had “completely torn the fake mask off the DPP”.

‘Accidental’ politician

Mr Lai and his supporters say his previous, more outspoken rhetoric is a thing of the past and that he has grown as a political leader.

“This is not just an election tactic,” said Mr Kuo Kuo-wen, a DPP lawmaker known for his close ties with Mr Lai, in an interview. “It reflects that Lai has learnt the reality of Taiwan’s international position and the stakes of geopolitical tensions.”

It is still unclear who Mr Lai could face in January’s vote. The opposition Kuomintang (KMT), which favours closer ties with China, has yet to decide on its candidate but says it will do so by the end of June.

Foxconn Technology Group founder Terry Gou and New Taipei City Mayor Hou Yu-ih are the main hopefuls, according to opinion polls. KMT chairman Eric Chu has indicated he does not intend to run, but he remains a possible outside contender.","TAIPEI – Mr William Lai Ching-te’s mother was bitterly disappointed when the Harvard-educated doctor told her in the 1990s that he was giving up his medical career to enter politics.

Of the 20 crew members on the Success 9, one is a Singaporean, said MPA. It did not give the nationalities of the remaining crew. The ship was boarded about 300 nautical miles (556km) off the Abidjan Coast.

MPA said it is working with the ship owner, the Monrovia Regional Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre and the Information Fusion Centre at the Changi Command and Control Centre to monitor the situation and render necessary assistance.

Hai Soon Group, a Singapore-registered company that owns the tanker, declined immediate comment, saying it awaited further updates.

The tanker has been operating in the West African zone for the past 60 days, Refinitiv ship-tracking data showed.

Its last shipping fixture record showed it was carrying diesel, according to Vortexa data.

An Ivorian security source involved in the matter said a patrol boat had been sent out to rescue the tanker, but was unable to locate it because its beacon had been turned off.

""We think it's an act of piracy because the modus operandi is the same,"" the source, who did not wish to be named, told Reuters.

""We have sought external help from Spain and from Europe,"" the source added.

According to the ship tracking website MarineTraffic, the Success 9 was built about 20 years ago and has a length of about 108m and a width of about 17m.

Its boarding comes after a similar incident in the region on Mar 26 in which the Liberia-flagged oil tanker Monjasa Reformer was reportedly boarded by five armed people, according to a report by the Maritime Domain Awareness Trade - Gulf of Guinea, a joint maritime monitoring initiative by France and the United Kingdom.","SINGAPORE: A Singapore-registered oil tanker was boarded by ""unidentified persons"" off Ivory Coast at about 10pm (Singapore time) on Monday (Apr 10), the Maritime and Port Authority (MPA) said late on Tuesday.

https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/manhattans-top-prosecutor-sues-to-stop-republican-intimidation-in-trump-case,Manhattan’s top prosecutor sues to stop Republican ‘intimidation’ in Trump case,"NEW YORK – Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg on Tuesday sued Republican United States Representative Jim Jordan to stop what Mr Bragg called a “campaign of intimidation” against the criminal prosecution of former president Donald Trump in New York.

The lawsuit aims to block a subpoena of Mr Mark Pomerantz, a former prosecutor who once led the Manhattan district attorney’s multi-year investigation of Trump, by the Republican-led House of Representatives Judiciary Committee, which Mr Jordan chairs.

Mr Bragg, a Democrat, called the subpoena an unconstitutional “incursion” into a state criminal case as payback for charging Trump in the first indictment of a former US president.

“Rather than allowing the criminal process to proceed in the ordinary course, Chairman Jordan and the committee are participating in a campaign of intimidation, retaliation and obstruction,” Mr Bragg’s lawyers wrote in the complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan.

Later on Tuesday, US District Judge Mary Kay Vyskocil set a hearing in the case for April 19. She gave Mr Jordan until April 17 to respond to Mr Bragg’s complaint.

Last week, Trump pleaded not guilty to 34 felony charges of falsifying business records to conceal a US$130,000 (S$173,000) hush money payment to buy porn star Stormy Daniels’ silence before the 2016 election about her alleged affair with him, which he denies.

Many Republicans have portrayed Mr Bragg’s prosecution as a politically motivated stunt to interfere in the 2024 presidential election, where Trump is seeking another White House term.

They have also questioned the district attorney’s use of federal funds for its investigation of Trump.

“First, they indict a president for no crime,” Mr Jordan tweeted on Tuesday.

“Then, they sue to block congressional oversight when we ask questions about the federal funds they say they used to do it.”

Mr Bragg’s office has told the committee it used US$5,000 in federal funds to investigate Trump and his namesake family company from 2019 to 2021.

The office said that money came from US$1 billion of asset forfeiture it secured for the government in the last 15 years.","Mr Bragg, a Democrat, called the subpoena an unconstitutional “incursion” into a state criminal case as payback for charging Trump in the first indictment of a former US president.

https://www.straitstimes.com/life/entertainment/at-the-movies-renfield-is-a-messy-toothless-take-on-the-vampire-comedy,"At The Movies: Renfield is a messy, toothless take on the vampire comedy","Renfield (M18)



93 minutes, opens on Thursday

2 stars

The story: Renfield (Nicholas Hoult) is a servant of Dracula (Nicolas Cage). It is a role that has earned him immortality and a smidgen of his master’s supernatural powers – as long as he keeps his boss supplied with bodies and anything else the vain, fickle bloodsucker desires. The pair move to New Orleans in search of a fresh start, but Renfield’s hunt is interrupted by feelings of dissatisfaction, coupled with emotions stirred by Rebecca (Awkwafina), a cop assigned to look into a spate of disappearances.

This chaotic assemblage of sounds and images begins with a great premise: Watching Dracula’s shenanigans from the point of view of his long-suffering lackey. Renfield is the manservant character from the 1897 book by Bram Stoker that started it all, Dracula.

In the novel, Renfield is deranged and pathetic. Here, as played by Hoult, he is Hugh Grant as a cute Goth kid – pale, floppy-haired and handsome, yet charmingly insecure and self-deprecating. It is clear that the creators want viewers to find him likeable and relatable.

Playing opposite him is the film’s villain, Dracula. If, like this reviewer, you believed that Cage was born to do a comedic take on the Count, note that his portrayal is unexpectedly restrained and sincere. This is all well and good, because it appears that honouring the scary side of the character is more important than mockery, something the hit comedy series What We Do In The Shadows (2019 to present) does very well.

At some point in the movie’s development, there might have been scenes that framed the relationship between the blood-drinker and his familiar as emotional vampirism, much like the disturbing Swedish horror hit Let The Right One In (2008) did, with great success.

But, other than having Renfield delve into his feelings in a 12-step meeting – tired movie trope alert – the central theme is quickly forgotten, replaced by too much plot and too many secondary characters, including the love interest played by the miscast Awkwafina. She has ditched her goofy ad-libs in favour of cranky observations about life, but her technique needs work.

Add to that the repetitive scenes of vampiric butchery that earn the film its M18 rating and you have a movie that sucks the fun out of the supernatural comedy genre.

Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s government is expected to sign off on the proposal submitted by local authorities for an integrated resort that would include hotels and conference halls, scheduled to open in late 2029, according to a Jiji report on Wednesday.

Cabinet ministers will decide on the move as early as Friday, the newswire said.

Delays in the screening process mean it may start operations in the western Japan prefecture much later.

Shares of gaming-related companies climbed in Tokyo. Orix, which has been working on the Osaka plan with MGM Resorts International, rose as much as 2.1 per cent, while gaming machine maker Universal Entertainment Corp’s stock jumped 6.9 per cent.

Building a casino is key to Japan’s hopes of capturing resurgent tourism demand and doubling the number of foreign visitors compared with pre-pandemic levels to 60 million by 2030.

The government is slated to approve up to three integrated resort locations, according to the report, with a rival bid submitted by Nagasaki prefecture still under review. Companies would need additional approval to operate the casino.

According to the Osaka plan, the resort will be built on the Yumeshima man-made island at an initial cost of 1.08 trillion yen (S$10.7 billion) and is expected to attract an estimated 20 million visitors a year.

Navalny, 46, is serving combined sentences of more than 11 years in a high-security penal colony for fraud and contempt of court on charges that he says were trumped up to silence him.

A documentary about him won an Oscar in March.

Navalny said he had been released from a solitary confinement cell on Friday and sentenced to another 15 days there on Monday after his supporters released findings from a probe that showed the prison service was supposedly paying far too much for cabbage and pocketing the surplus.

“That is why the very next day after my colleagues released their investigation about these fun cabbage stories, they put me in the (confinement cell), immediately started setting up a ‘working cell’ for me and changed the daily routine, turning it from hellish to extremely hellish,” he tweeted.

Navalny, who survived an attempt to poison him in 2020, has repeatedly been placed in punishment cells over the past year, and backers say his life is in danger as his health worsens.

Lawyer Vadim Kobzev said an ambulance had been called to the colony on Friday night after Navalny’s condition deteriorated as the result of a stomach ailment. The prisoner lost 8kg during the most recent 15-day spell of solitary confinement, he tweeted.

Navalny, who has over the years released dozens of videos alleging what he says is massive corruption in Russia, also said prison officials “made up completely unlawful rules, forbidding me to buy food, even with the money I had earned”.

The movements came as the International Monetary Fund trimmed its global growth forecast while a Federal Reserve official urged caution about raising interest rates too aggressively.

“Today’s headlines didn’t tell Wall Street anything it didn’t already know,” said Mr Edward Moya, of the Oanda trading platform, echoing analyst sentiment that lower global growth was likely already priced-in by markets.

But he said he expects that upcoming inflation figures will likely support one more rate hike by the Fed, to rein in stubborn price increases.

https://www.malaymail.com/news/sports/2023/04/12/spallettis-napoli-good-enough-without-injured-osimhen/64399,Spalletti’s Napoli good enough without injured Osimhen,"MILAN, April 12 — Luciano Spalletti said yesterday that Napoli will not miss Victor Osimhen in this week’s Champions League quarter-final, first leg with AC Milan after the Nigeria striker failed to recover from a thigh injury.

Napoli’s star player and Serie A’s top scorer had been in a race against time to play in today's fixture at the San Siro and was left out of the squad before Spalletti’s outfit travelled to Milan.

Napoli have been hammered at home by Milan and earned an unconvincing win at lowly Lecce since Osimhen picked his injury on international duty.

But Spalletti pointed to his team winning every game when Osimhen was last injured in the autumn as evidence the absence of 24-year-old will not hurt his side.

“The strength of a team is never just the sum of its various parts. It’s the sum of all its qualities, how they co-exist and the way the team works together,” Spalletti told reporters.

“Our team up to now has shown it can play regardless of the formation picked at the beginning of the match... We’re at this point because we’ve won important matches without Osimhen, so I expect the same thing.”

Taking Osimhen’s place could be Italy’s Giacomo Raspadori who did participate with the rest of the squad in yesterday's training.

He is Napoli’s only fit striker as Italy’s champions elect also announced yesterday that Giovanni Simeone had suffered a hamstring injury.

Turkish coffee with Guardiola

Simeone had come on for Raspadori as a second-half substitute in Napoli’s 2-1 win at Lecce on Friday before having to leave the field injured in the final 10 minutes.

“I need to assess Raspadori because he’s only had today for proper team training. We’ve got another half a day in which to see who will play in that position,” Spalletti said.

Spalletti also had time to launch a cheeky reply to Pep Guardiola, who on Monday joked to reporters that he did not want to speak about Napoli because Spalletti was “sensitive”.

The 64-year-old was not impressed when, after Napoli beat Eintracht Frankfurt in the last 16, he was asked if he was flattered by Guardiola proclaiming his side the best in Europe, saying it was “a game that people play to put pressure on other teams”.

Spalletti jokingly stood up in honour of Guardiola, considered one of the all-time great coaches, while telling reporters he had “learned so many things from him”.

“For me Guardiola is like Klopp or other great coaches... it’s an honour when a coach like Guardiola speaks well of Napoli and says nice things about how we play football,” Spalletti said.

“If you then say that we can win Champions League that’s another thing entirely.

“We’re not that team that has to worry about showing what it’s made of in this competition. We’ve already shown enough, we’ve got the result we wanted and that’s made history for us.

“That said, I hope I can have a laugh with him about this with him about it (at the Champions League final in June) over a nice Turkish coffee.” — AFP","Napoli have been hammered at home by Milan and earned an unconvincing win at lowly Lecce since Osimhen picked his injury on international duty.

Paratici was handed a 30-month suspension from Italian football in January after his former club Juventus were found guilty of false accounting.

The 50-year-old Italian was sporting director and managing director at Juventus before joining Tottenham in June 2021.

His initial ban only applied to his homeland, meaning he was free to continue working at Tottenham.

But Fifa threw the Tottenham hierarchy into turmoil on March 29 when the global governing body extended Paratici’s suspension across the rest of the football world.

“Fifa can only confirm that an appeal has been lodged by Mr Paratici against the decision passed by the Chairperson of the Disciplinary Committee to extend the sanction imposed by the FIGC (the Italian Football Federation) so as to have worldwide effect,” a Fifa statement said on Tuesday.

In March, Paratici agreed to take an immediate leave of absence from Tottenham following his suspension, adding to the troubled club’s problems after they parted company with manager Antonio Conte.

Prior to the ban, Paratici had been expected to play a key role in finding Conte’s successor as he worked alongside Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy.

Cristian Stellini, previously Conte’s assistant, is in charge of Tottenham on an interim basis until the end of the season.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/swiss-president-says-credit-suisse-rescue-averted-catastrophe-ubs-3410156,Swiss parliament fumes over Credit Suisse collapse,"BERN: The Swiss parliament voiced its fury on Tuesday (Apr 11) at the collapse of Credit Suisse and how the rules intended to prevent such a major bank from getting itself into trouble completely failed.

At an extraordinary session of parliament called to debate the implosion of the bank and its takeover by larger rival UBS, Swiss President Alain Berset defended orchestrating the merger, saying a bankruptcy would have triggered a financial catastrophe and shredded the country's reputation.

However, lawmakers lined up to slam the controversial Mar 19 deal that Berset's government rapidly stitched together behind closed doors - cutting out parliament and presenting lawmakers with a fait accompli.

The merger dramatically changes the financial landscape in the wealthy Alpine country, which stakes much of its national prestige on sound banking.

The takeover triggered widespread unease in Switzerland at how the second-largest bank - one of 30 around the world deemed too big to fail -- quickly imploded, after a series of scandals and ill-fated investment risks fatally undermined confidence in the 167-year-old national institution.

RED CARPET FOR BIG BANKS

Speaking for the right-wing populist Swiss People's Party, Hansjoerg Knecht said small businesses had ""skin in the game"" but the ""red carpet of state aid"" would never be rolled out for them.

""Family companies and SMEs have always known how important it is to do business in a sustainable, realistic and prudent manner,"" he said in the Council of States upper chamber.

""If we want to preserve the Swiss financial centre, we must ensure that the systemically-important banks also reflect on these values.""

Eva Herzog, speaking for the Socialist Party, said: ""Apparently, the 2008 financial crisis wasn't enough to wipe out the type of banker we gleefully watched go under with Leonardo DiCaprio in The Wolf of Wall Street.""

The creation of a new supersized UBS ""has done exactly what we didn't want: created an even bigger bank, which if it got into trouble would probably be too much for the existing too-big-to-fail rules to handle as well, based on the experiences we have just had.""

Despite the criticism, the upper chamber voted Tuesday for the 109 billion Swiss francs (US$120 billion) in government guarantees that were provided as part of the deal.","BERN: The Swiss parliament voiced its fury on Tuesday (Apr 11) at the collapse of Credit Suisse and how the rules intended to prevent such a major bank from getting itself into trouble completely failed.
At an extraordinary session of parliament called to debate the implosion of the bank and its takeover by larger rival UBS, Swiss President Alain Berset defended orchestrating the merger, saying a bankruptcy would have triggered a financial catastrophe and shredded the country's reputation.
The merger dramatically changes the financial landscape in the wealthy Alpine country, which stakes much of its national prestige on sound banking.

https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/erdogan-launches-election-campaign-with-pledge-to-slash-turkey-inflation,Erdogan launches election campaign with pledge to slash Turkey inflation,"ANKARA – Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan launched his re-election campaign on Tuesday with a party pledge to slash inflation to single digits and boost growth, as he seeks to extend his two decades in power in a May 14 vote.

Mr Erdogan is facing the biggest political challenge since his AK Party (AKP) came to power in 2002, with polls showing support sagging in recent years after unorthodox economic policies hobbled Turkey’s lira currency and sent inflation surging.

Even so, the President repeated his economic mantra that investment, production, exports and an eventual current account surplus would drive gross domestic product (GDP).

“We will bring inflation back down to single digits and definitely save our country from this problem,” he told a stadium crowd in Ankara.

Mr Erdogan’s aggressive interest rate cuts sent inflation to a 24-year peak above 85 per cent last October before it dipped to about 50 per cent in March. The ensuing cost-of-living crisis has gripped Turkish households and squeezed earnings and savings.

“We will improve the investment further with a structure based on a free-market economy integrated with the world,” the ruling party’s manifesto said, aiming for annual growth of 5.5 per cent in 2024 to 2028, and GDP of US$1.5 trillion (S$2 trillion) by end-2028.

Mr Erdogan said last week that a team was working on strengthening economic policies under the coordination of former economic czar Mehmet Simsek, who is well respected by international investors.

Some AKP members have said they wanted Mr Simsek to champion a pivot to more free-market policies after years of unorthodoxy under Mr Erdogan.

However, the manifesto made no direct reference to a return to orthodoxy, and said the low-rate policy was the main driver of entrepreneurs investing in the real sector and creating jobs.

In the presidential election in May, Mr Erdogan will be up against main opposition alliance candidate Kemal Kilicdaroglu.

In the latest survey from Metropoll, 42.6 per cent of respondents said they would vote for Mr Kilicdaroglu and 41.1 per cent for Mr Erdogan in first-round voting, with the other two presidential candidates receiving a total of 7.2 per cent support.

Support for Mr Erdogan dipped slightly after February’s devastating earthquake, amid perceptions of an initially slow response.

“Our priority in the upcoming period will be to restore our cities which were devastated,” Mr Erdogan said, adding that the government aims to build 650,000 apartments for survivors.

On foreign policy, Mr Erdogan said the AKP would continue normalising relations in the region and aim to build an “axis of Turkey”. Ankara recently took steps to mend relations with Israel, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Syria after years of tension.

“We can negotiate with both sides in the Russia-Ukraine war, make concrete progress such as the grain corridor and prisoner exchange, and we can still speak of the possibility of peace,” Mr Erdogan said.

https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/south-asia/pm-modi-s-bjp-battles-corrupt-image-as-it-seeks-reelection-in-its-only-south-indian-state,PM Modi’s BJP battles corrupt image as it seeks re-election in its only south Indian state,"BENGALURU – As political parties gear up for battle in the Karnataka state polls on May 10, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) hopes of returning to power in its sole southern stronghold are hobbled by graft allegations against several legislators.

The outcome of the election in the southern state of 64 million people is likely to impact that of the national election in May 2024, when the BJP will seek a third term with Mr Narendra Modi as prime minister.

Analysts say it will also influence the results of elections scheduled in the states of Telangana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Mizoram.

Karnataka’s significance to the BJP is obvious from the frequent visits Mr Modi has been making to the state this year. On those trips, he has inaugurated universities, highways, metro trains, factories, airports and statues – often taking the opportunity to urge people to return his party to power.

The opposition parties in Karnataka have criticised the grand inauguration ceremonies that Mr Modi has been attending, alleging that public funds were indirectly being spent on his election campaign for the BJP.

Graft allegations have emerged against sitting Karnataka Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai, who is campaigning for his party’s re-election on May 10 – although the BJP has not announced its candidate yet.

In August 2022, his government was accused by the Karnataka State Contractors Association of forcing contractors to pay 40 per cent of all contracts as “commission” to politicians.

Two contractors committed suicide in April and December 2022, blaming the Bommai government for refusing to pay bills without kickbacks.

Senior politician and rural development minister K.S. Eshwarappa, 74, who was named by one of the contractors, resigned over this.

Mr Bommai, 63, has claimed innocence and ordered a probe, but after a legislator’s son was caught taking a bribe of 400,000 rupees (S$6,500) in March, the accusations resurfaced.

He has also been telling reporters that despite the challenges, his party is “working hard to ensure that this time, the BJP will win a majority”.","Analysts say it will also influence the results of elections scheduled in the states of Telangana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Mizoram.

https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/russia-says-us-reporter-violated-law-as-biden-calls-detention-totally-illegal,Russia says US reporter violated law as Biden calls detention ‘totally illegal’,"WASHINGTON – The Kremlin said on Tuesday that Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich had “violated Russian law” and had been caught “red-handed”, one day after the US State Department officially designated him as having been “wrongfully detained”.

Russia’s Federal Security Service arrested Gershkovich in March on espionage charges widely decried as bogus by the White House, other Western countries, The Wall Street Journal, dozens of media organisations and human rights groups.

The United States’ determination that he was “wrongfully detained” means it believes he was targeted primarily because he is an American citizen, and its transfer of the case from the State Department to the office of the US’ special envoy for hostage affairs raises the issue’s political profile.

“We’re making it real clear that it’s totally illegal what’s happening and we declared it, so – changes the dynamic,” US President Joe Biden told reporters.

Gershkovich’s family said later they had spoken with Mr Biden.

“We are encouraged that the State Department has officially designated Evan as wrongfully detained. We appreciate President Biden’s call to us today, assuring us that the US government is doing everything in its power to bring him home as quickly as possible,” a statement from the family said.

Asked about the US State Department’s move, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov repeated Russia’s position that Gershkovich broke the law.

He said Gershkovich had “been caught red-handed and violated the laws of the Russian Federation”, before adding: “This is what he’s suspected of, but of course, the court will make a decision.”

More than 99 per cent of criminal cases in Russia end in a conviction and the country has long been criticised by rights monitors for a lack of judicial independence.","WASHINGTON – The Kremlin said on Tuesday that Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich had “violated Russian law” and had been caught “red-handed”, one day after the US State Department officially designated him as having been “wrongfully detained”.

“The allegations that have been made over recent weeks about the CBI have been devastating,” the business lobby said in a statement.

“While investigations continue into a number of these, it is already clear to all of us that there have been serious failings in how we have acted as an organisation. We must do better, and we must be better.”

Mr Danker stepped aside in March while the CBI conducted a review into his behaviour.

The CBI is one of Britain’s best-known business organisations, representing the interests of many of the country’s biggest companies to the government and more widely.

The Guardian newspaper had reported that more than a dozen women have claimed to be victims of sexual misconduct by senior figures at the CBI, including one who alleged she was raped at a staff party.

The CBI said three employees were suspended pending further investigation into a number of ongoing allegations.

“The CBI is liaising with the police and has made clear its intention to cooperate fully with any police investigations,” it said.

The CBI said the board wished to make clear that Mr Danker was not the subject of the more recent allegations in the Guardian but it had determined that his conduct fell short of that expected of the director-general.

Ms Newton-Smith, a former Bank of England economist, left the CBI in March to join Barclays, where she is managing director for strategy and policy, sustainability and ESG (environmental, social and governance).

After he was suspended, Mr Danker expressed regret over his behaviour.

“It’s been mortifying to hear that I have caused offence or anxiety to any colleague. It was completely unintentional, and I apologise profusely,” he said in a statement.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/leak-classified-us-documents-what-we-know-impact-3408636,What we know: Leak of classified US documents,"WASHINGTON: The apparent leak of a trove of highly classified US documents - including many related to the Ukraine conflict - has triggered a criminal investigation as well as a multi-agency effort to assess the potential fallout.

The source of the leaked documents is unknown and as of Monday (Apr 10) the Department of Defense was still working to assess their authenticity, though it has acknowledged they appear to contain sensitive, classified material.

The data has been present online for weeks or possibly even longer, though it only gained widespread media attention earlier this month. Here is what we know so far about the breach:

WHAT ARE THE DOCUMENTS ABOUT?

Many relate to the war in Ukraine. One provides information about the status of the conflict as of early March, including on Russian and Ukrainian casualties, while others detail the situations on specific fronts such as the battleground city of Bakhmut.

Another provides information about Ukrainian air defences, which have been key to countering Russian missile and drone strikes, while one shows details on international efforts to build up Kyiv's military forces.

Other documents aren't related to Ukraine. Some, for example, point to US surveillance of its allies, such as one that states leaders of Israel's Mossad intelligence agency advocated for domestic protests against a controversial Israeli judicial reform plan that would have given lawmakers substantially more control over the supreme court.

ARE THEY GENUINE?

The Pentagon says it is working to ""assess the validity of the photographed documents that are circulating on social media sites"", but admitted they ""appear to contain sensitive and highly classified material"".

At least one document seems to have been manipulated to make it say that Ukraine had suffered higher casualties than Russia, when the apparent original version said the reverse was true.

Apple TV+, with new episodes released on Wednesday

4 stars

Overnight, a mysterious machine appears in a small-town grocery store and, for a few coins, purports to tell a person his or her true “life potential”. Here are three reasons to catch this gently melancholic existential comedy.

1. Twilight Zone-worthy premise

The machine scans each person’s fingerprints and spits out a card, which says things such as “magician”, “meteorologist” or “storyteller” – though some get darker, more cryptic pronouncements.

This sparks not only great excitement but also a tsunami of existential crises as residents start making big life changes to try and fulfil their destinies.

It soon becomes apparent that being told what one’s potential is can be both a blessing and a curse.

High-school teacher Dusty (Chris O’Dowd) is disappointed that all his card says is “teacher/whistler”, the latter being one of his few talents.

But his wife Cass (Gabrielle Dennis) gets “royalty”, which seems unattainable but makes her realise she wants more from life, putting a strain on their marriage.

2. Everyman existential angst

As it surveys different characters, The Big Door Prize poses a question that does not get asked enough in the current age of self-help: Is it better to chase a big dream or make the most of what one has?

And what would you do if the world’s most accurate personality and aptitude test told you exactly what you should be doing with your life?","The Big Door PrizeApple TV+, with new episodes released on Wednesday4 starsOvernight, a mysterious machine appears in a small-town grocery store and, for a few coins, purports to tell a person his or her true “life potential”.

Misgivings over what would happen to Pakatan Harapan’s (PH) reform agenda after it teamed up with the graft-tainted Umno party to form the government in November have deepened in recent days.

Not only has Umno begun undermining the judiciary in a bid to push for its ex-leader Najib Razak to be released from his 12-year jail sentence, its party president and deputy prime minister Zahid Hamidi has obtained his passport back from court and a trial adjournment to consider whether the 47 graft charges against him should be dropped.

Meanwhile Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and his PH coalition have drawn flak for retaining the services of Tan Sri Azam Baki, the controversial chief of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission, amid questionable moves made by him and the agency.

Public outcry has also ensued over the government’s move to tax vaping products, which inadvertently created a legal loophole that allows minors to buy and consume these products.

The suspects who allegedly held the women have been arrested, local police said on Tuesday.

The island’s provincial police agency said they had arrested four suspects, including a South Korean bar owner in his 40s, his Chinese wife, and two of their accomplices.

The suspects have been sent to the prosecutor’s office.

The victims arrived in South Korea in November for work, but they had been deceived by an immigration broker.

The broker allegedly swindled the victims by promising them employment as servers at restaurants on Jeju Island.

The four women were confined in a basement studio located 1km away from the bar – the front for a brothel – where they were sexually exploited.

One of the accomplices reportedly lived with them to monitor them round the clock.

The police rescued the four women in March.

One of the victims managed to escape during the daytime on March 4 when everyone was asleep. She sought help from the police, who later transferred the victims to a shelter.

The suspects ran their business with the main entrance closed and the lights turned off to evade detection. They required customers to make reservations for sexual services.

The immigration broker had already left the country before the case was reported to the police.

“The Korean police have sought Interpol’s assistance in locating the broker,” said a police officer.

Local fishermen reported the first sightings early yesterday. A woman who lives in the fishing village said she noticed the incident shortly after dawn, prompting the arrival of vultures.

“This made us all sad. We’ve never seen the death of stingrays like this here,” said fisherman Renato dos Reis Oliveira.

Biologist Ricardo Gomes, from the Mar Urbano Institute, argued the absence of other dead species on the beach indicates the incident was likely not caused by pollutants or a lack of oxygen in the water.

“This makes the hypothesis of trawling more evident in the cases of these stingrays,” he said.

Trawling is a fishing technique that involves pulling a net through the water behind one or more boats.

“This is not (the stingray’s natural) place, so this is strange even for the people who are here and who live off fishing,” said environmentalist Isabeli Delois.

He will take charge of Leicester’s last eight games of the campaign as they battle to extend their nine-year stay in the top tier.

The Foxes sit second bottom in the table and are two points from safety after last Saturday’s damaging 1-0 home defeat by fellow strugglers Bournemouth – their 19th league loss of the season.

“I’m really happy to have the opportunity to lead the team during these final weeks of the season,” Smith said.

“The challenge in front of us is clear, but it’s one myself and my coaching team have experienced before and, with the quality in this squad and the number of games remaining, it’s very much achievable.

“Our first job is to rebuild confidence and instil belief in the team and I’m looking forward to getting to work with the players this week.”

Leicester chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha expressed confidence that Smith is the right man.

“We’ve endured a challenging season, but I have no doubt that we have the quality in our squad to win this fight,” he said.

“Dean’s experience will be key to unlocking that potential, helping the team rediscover its confidence and channelling the support of our fans, who will be so important during these final eight games.

“This is a fight we can win, together.”","LONDON – Leicester City have named former Aston Villa and Norwich City boss Dean Smith as caretaker manager until the end of the season, the Premier League club announced on Monday.

Australia have not relinquished the famous urn since reclaiming it in 2017-18 but will face a buoyant England team who have won 10 of their last 12 tests under Stokes and head coach Brendon ""Baz"" McCullum.

England's highly entertaining ""Bazball"" approach has earned plaudits, and they will look to take that aggressive style into the Ashes where they should be able to call upon speedsters Mark Wood and Jofra Archer.

""I think I know what the starting XI is going to be, there or thereabouts,"" Stokes told Sky Sports.

""Having the option to bowl above 90mph, any captain wants that. (But) when it comes to that first test I will be making sure I pick the best team for that first game.

""We've been clear with the groundstaff what type of wickets we want and they have been responsive. We want flat, fast wickets. We want to score quickly. If that brings (Australia's) guys in, they will be happy. I'm smiling, because I'm looking forward to it.""

All-rounder Stokes has mostly played as a batter during this season's Indian Premier League (IPL) campaign with Chennai Super Kings, bowling just one over in two matches due to a troublesome left knee.

Stokes said his recovery from the knee issue was ""going nicely. But I'm not going to rush myself, the main priority is making sure I can fulfil my role as a fourth seamer in the Ashes,"" he added.

Trading was largely sluggish as many markets reopened after a long holiday weekend.

European stocks added 0.5 per cent, US equity futures pointed to a positive Wall Street open and Japan’s blue-chip Nikkei rallied over 1 per cent.

Bolstering the case for global inflation easing further this year, data showed China’s consumer inflation hit an 18-month low and factory-gate price declines sped up in March as demand remained weak.

Investor morale in the euro zone meanwhile improved in April after a surprise dip in March, a survey showed.

South Korea’s central bank held rates steady for a second consecutive meeting today, while the Bank of Canada is expected to leave rates unchanged when it meets tomorrow.

Friday’s non-farm payrolls suggested labour markets remain resilient, boosting expectations for a 25-basis-point (bps) US rate increase in May. Markets price in a roughly 70 per cent chance of a May hike, having last week priced such a move as a coin toss.

“It seems that we are currently in an environment that the world is looking at a soft landing and the need not to over-tighten policy,” said Nordea chief analyst Jan von Gerich.

“The payrolls number was strong enough to suggest that the economy could avoid a deeper recession but not too strong to suggest the Fed needs to tighten by much more.”

Traders still price in rate cuts by year-end as the economic growth outlook weakens, exacerbated by banking turmoil.

An analysis in the International Monetary Fund’s latest World Economic Outlook suggested that current high rates “are likely to be temporary” and predicted that, once inflation is brought under control, rates in advanced economies would eventually return to pre-pandemic levels.

The International Monetary Fund’s latest global economic outlook is out later today.

US March inflation data tomorrow could provide the next steer for markets on the rate outlook.

“I don’t think the Fed should be hiking rates again but the reality is that they probably will do one more 25bp hike,” said Guy Miller, chief market strategist at Zurich Insurance Group.

“The reason for that is that core inflation is still running at high levels and the services sector is very robust.”

Stability

Investor sentiment has also been boosted by signs that turmoil in the banking sector is easing.

Deposits at US commercial banks rose near the end of March for the first time in about a month, showing signs of stabilizing after the two largest bank failures since the financial crisis rocked the banking system and rattled depositors, Federal Reserve data on Friday showed.

In Europe, UBS shares rose just over 1 per cent after JP Morgan raised its target price, while the Swiss parliament held an extraordinary session to discuss last month’s UBS-Credit Suisse deal.

“My feeling is that it’s not over - we’re just beginning to feel the pain of these much higher interest rates. And banks may be okay for now, but the credit risk is still to impact both them and the economy,” said Zurich’s Miller, referring to recent pain in markets.

The dollar was broadly softer, giving up some of its post-payrolls gains. It eased 0.4 per cent to 133 yen, after jumping 1.1 per cent yesterday. The euro was up 0.5 per cent at US$1.091 (RM4.82) .

Bitcoin touched a fresh 10-month high at US$30,438 before pulling back to US$30,148, after breaking free of recent ranges yesterday. The digital token had been stuck between about US$26,500 and US$29,400 for the previous three weeks.

In Asia, Japanese government bond yields mostly fell, after new Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda vowed on Monday to maintain the bank’s ultra-loose monetary policy.

The 10-year JGB yield fell to as low as 0.445 per cent, its lowest since April 4, after hovering at 0.465 per cent in the previous session.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/ford-will-retool-ontario-factory-build-evs-starting-next-year-3410651,Ford will retool Ontario factory to build EVs starting next year,"DETROIT : Ford Motor Co said Tuesday that next year it will start retooling its sport utility vehicle assembly plant in Oakville, Ontario to produce electric vehicles, fulfilling a promise made to Canada's Unifor union during contract bargaining in 2020.

Ford plans to begin overhauling the Oakville complex in the second quarter of 2024, idling most of the factory's production workers until the new EV assembly system starts up in late 2024, company officials said Tuesday during a conference call.

As part of the C$1.8 billion ($1.34 billion) overhaul, the 70-year-old complex will get a new battery pack assembly operation, said Dave Nowicki, Ford's director of manufacturing operations for electric vehicles.

Ford officials declined to say whether the plant will assemble five EV models, as agreed with Unifor during the 2020 contract talks.

The size, timing and location of electric vehicle production investments by Ford, General Motors Co and Stellantis NV will be a central issue in contract bargaining later this year with unions on both sides of the U.S.-Canada border. Both Unifor and the U.S. United Auto Workers want the Detroit automakers to commit to preserving jobs as they transition from combustion to electric vehicles.

The Oakville plant currently builds combustion Ford Edge and Lincoln Nautilus SUVs. The makeover of the factory is part of a $50 billion investment program through 2026. Ford Chief Executive Jim Farley has said Ford will have the ability to assemble 2 million EVs globally by 2026.

Ford officials said Oakville will build the automaker's next-generation EVs, which Ford executives have said will have to be more efficient, easier to assemble and more competitive with the Tesla Inc vehicles that currently lead in North American market EV sales.

Battery cells for the Oakville-built EVs will come from a factory Ford and battery partner SK On plan are building in Kentucky, Nowicki said. It is too early to tell whether the batteries will meet domestic content requirements to qualify for U.S. Inflation Reduction Act purchase subsidies, he said.

The Blues have struggled this season and are 11th in the Premier League, but face Los Blancos at the Santiago Bernabeu in the Champions League quarter-final, first leg.

Lampard, who took over last week as coach until the end of the season after Graham Potter was sacked, confirmed Chelsea would have N’Golo Kante, Thiago Silva and Mason Mount available after injury issues.

“You can only become a leader in action — there’s no point being called a leader until you show it on the pitch,” Lampard told reporters yesterday.

“Where we have brought in some younger players, we have to give them the chance to develop into the leaders we want them to be.

“In (Enzo Fernandez) I see a leader, but he’s 22 years old. Games like tomorrow are great chance to perform and show that personality that makes you a proper leader.”

Lampard was one of Chelsea’s leaders on the charge to winning the competition for the first time in 2012, alongside other club greats including John Terry and Didier Drogba.

Roberto Di Matteo took over the Blues on an interim basis in March 2012 after Andre Villas-Boas was sacked, and led the side to European glory.

Lampard said he had not spoke to Di Matteo ahead of facing Real Madrid, who beat Chelsea in the quarter-finals last season.

“There are parallels in a simple sense, we’re ex-players, he did an amazing job (but) I think my situation is different in practice,” Lampard said.

“I have to be careful making that parallel because we have very tough games in front of us starting tomorrow, there’s a lot of work to be done.

“We will try if we can to create our own little bit of history, but the steps in front of us are very difficult of course.”

Madrid beat Chelsea 3-1 at Stamford Bridge last season before salvaging a 3-2 defeat at home to progress to the semi-finals.

Rodrygo Goes scored a late goal to force the game to extra-time after Chelsea had gone 3-0 up, created by a remarkable Luka Modric assist.

It was another memorable game at the Bernabeu for Madrid, who produced spectacular comebacks against Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester City on the way to winning the trophy for a record 14th time.

“One thing I would say, having watched Real Madrid and having a relationship with Carlo Ancelotti, who’s been incredible in his time here, is that the players have to understand this is a special arena and a special football club,” Lampard said.

“Some things you can’t control, but we have to control what we can control, and understand the quality in the Real Madrid team.” — AFP","MADRID, April 12 — Frank Lampard called on his young Chelsea side to become “leaders” when they face European champions Real Madrid today.

The 44-year-old is back in charge at Stamford Bridge until the end of the season after replacing the sacked Graham Potter last week.

The interim Chelsea boss has insisted that anything can happen if his players show enough desire.

“There’s a lot to it. Part of that (2012 success) was we parked the bus at the Nou Camp (against Barcelona in the semi-finals) and managed to hang on for our dear lives,” he said.

“But we did have a huge desire and a big character and a level of talent in the group that have been striving for years to win a Champions League, so that one you remember. A team and a group will always go through tough moments to get to great ones.”

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/marketmind-calm-us-inflation-storm-3411471,Marketmind: Calm before the US inflation storm,"A look at the day ahead in Asian markets from Jamie McGeever.

The world is bracing for U.S. inflation figures on Wednesday, but before that Asia gets to digest a mixed performance on Wall Street, another creep up in U.S. bond yields, and a major inflation report of its own.

Indian consumer price inflation for March tops a regional economic calendar on Wednesday which also includes Indian industrial production, South Korean unemployment, and corporate goods inflation and machinery orders from Japan.

These releases come against a backdrop of global stock markets still maintaining a glass-half-full outlook despite the growth picture fraying at the edges and bond yields continuing a steady creep higher.

Asian stock markets, in particular, are holding firm - the MSCI Asia ex-Japan index rose 0.6 per cent on Tuesday, its third consecutive increase and its best performance this month.

The U.S. CPI inflation report for March will go a long way to determining what the Fed decides at its May 2-3 policy meeting. Markets expect headline inflation to continue slowing, but are still shifting towards pricing in another quarter point rate hike.

GRAPHIC: Indian CPI inflation and policy rate https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gdvzqnmrepw/IndiaCPI.jpg

India's consumer inflation, meanwhile, likely eased in March to 5.80 per cent, thanks to softer food price rises, dipping below the Reserve Bank of India's upper tolerance limit of 6.00 per cent for the first time this year.

The data comes less than a week after the RBI surprised markets by holding its key interest rate steady at 6.50 per cent when most expected a 25 basis point rise.

South Korean unemployment in February fell back to match last August's record low of 2.6 per cent, so a further decline in the March reading would break new historic ground.

Finance ministers and central bank officials from around the world are in Washington for this week's International Monetary Fund and World Bank spring meetings.

The IMF on Tuesday trimmed its global growth outlook for this year and next as higher interest rates bite, and warned that the risk of ""perilous"" financial turmoil could slash output to near recessionary levels.

The global lender kept its Chinese growth forecasts at 5.2 per cent and 4.5 per cent, respectively, but lowered its 2023 Indian GDP growth forecast by a fifth of a percentage point to 5.9 per cent and next year's outlook by half a point to 6.3 per cent.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen was more optimistic about global economic growth and warned against overdoing the 'negativism'. She also said she still hopes to visit China, underscoring President Joe Biden's focus on opening up and maintaining channels of communication with Beijing.

Here are three key developments that could provide more direction to markets on Wednesday:

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/imf-flashes-financial-risk-warnings-urges-continued-inflation-fight-3411391,IMF flashes financial risk warnings but urges continued inflation fight,"WASHINGTON: The International Monetary Fund warned on Tuesday (Apr 11) that lurking financial system vulnerabilities could erupt into a new crisis and slam global growth this year, but urged member countries to keep tightening monetary policy to fight persistently high inflation.

The warnings set an ominous tone for the IMF and World Bank spring meetings in Washington this week, with conflicting economic and market forces clouding the policy path as growth slows in response to rapid central bank interest rate hikes.

The IMF on Tuesday edged its 2023 global growth forecasts lower, its baseline assumptions excluding, for now, a major new flare-up of financial system turmoil after the failures in March of US lenders Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank and Switzerland's forced sale of Credit Suisse.

The Fund's World Economic Outlook forecast real GDP growth of 2.8 per cent in 2023 and 3.0 per cent in 2024 - one-tenth of a percentage point lower than what it predicted in January for each year. The global economy grew 3.4 per cent in 2022.

The downgrades reflected weaker performances in some larger economies, such as Japan, Germany, India and Brazil, offsetting a stronger performance in the United States and a shallower contraction in Britain. The IMF also cited expectations of tighter financial conditions this year.

But its forecast was dominated by downside risks, including even higher inflation, an escalation of the war in Ukraine and a severe adverse scenario of a new financial crisis that could prompt sharp pull-backs in lending and household spending and a rush into safe-haven assets. The latter could slam global growth back to about 1 per cent this year, effectively a recession on a per-capita GDP basis.

""PERILOUS"" RISKS

The IMF's Global Financial Stability Report warned of a ""perilous combination of vulnerabilities"" in financial markets, saying that some participants had failed to adequately prepare for the impact of interest rate increases.

Such risks had increased rapidly in the wake of last month's turmoil in the global financial system, with investors remaining on edge and some looking for the next weakest link that could spread contagion, IMF officials said.

""Even if you think that on average, banks have a lot of capital and liquidity, there could be these weak institutions that then spill back into the system as a whole,"" Tobias Adrian, the director of the IMF's Monetary and Capital Markets Department, told Reuters.

Despite the warnings, the IMF's chief economist, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, said inflation is still the bigger problem and that price stability should take precedence over financial stability risks for central banks' monetary policy. Only in the event of a very severe financial crisis should those priorities be reversed, he said in a news conference.

YELLEN PUSHBACK

US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen pushed back on the IMF's outlook, telling a separate news conference that the outlook was ""reasonably bright"" though she said she was staying ""vigilant"" to downside risks including banking pressures and the war in Ukraine.

""I wouldn't overdo the negativism about the global economy,"" Yellen said, adding that a number of economies, including the United States, were proving resilient with strong labor markets, easing supply chain problems and lower energy costs.

Yellen said she had not seen evidence of a squeeze in credit after the SVB and Signature Bank failures, and that the US banking system was sound, with strong capital and liquidity positions. She added that the global financial system was also resilient due to reforms enacted after the 2008 financial crisis.","WASHINGTON: The International Monetary Fund warned on Tuesday (Apr 11) that lurking financial system vulnerabilities could erupt into a new crisis and slam global growth this year, but urged member countries to keep tightening monetary policy to fight persistently high inflation.

""Before providing services to the public that use generative AI products, a security assessment shall be applied for through national internet regulatory departments,"" the draft law, released by the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), reads.

The draft law - dubbed ""Administrative Measures for Generative Artificial Intelligence Services"" - aims to ensure ""the healthy development and standardised application of generative AI technology"", it read.

AI-generated content, it continued, must ""reflect core socialist values, and must not contain content on subversion of state power"".

It must also not contain, among other things, ""terrorist or extremist propaganda"", ""ethnic hatred"" or ""other content that may disrupt economic and social order.""

The proposed regulations come after a slew of Chinese tech giants, including Baidu, SenseTime and Alibaba, showed off in recent weeks their new artificial intelligence models which can power applications ranging from chatbots to image generators.

They also come as several governments are considering how to mitigate the dangers of the emerging technology, which has experienced a boom in investment and consumer popularity in recent months after the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT.

Rapid advancements in AI have stoked global alarm over the technology's potential for disinformation and misuse, with deepfake images and people shown mouthing things they never said.

ChatGPT is unavailable in China, but the American software is gaining a base of Chinese users who use virtual private networks to get around the ban, deploying it to write essays and cram for exams.

China has announced ambitious plans to become a global leader in the field of AI by 2030, and consultancy group McKinsey estimates the sector could add about US$600 billion every year to China's gross domestic product by then.

The TRON token fell nearly 5 per cent against the U.S. dollar after the announcement, which was posted on Twitter and the Binance.US website, while the much smaller Spell token fell more than 5 per cent, based on data from CoinMarketCap.

Braden Yap Hong Sheng entered the plea after the charge was read to him in Mandarin by a court interpreter in front of Sessions Judge Che Wan Zaidi Che Wan Ibrahim on Wednesday.

According to the charge sheet, Yap had caused excruciating pain to a brown female dog by beating it and setting it on fire.

The act was committed at 1.49am on March 27 in front of premises in Jalan Impian Emas 22, Taman Impian Emas, in Johor.

The offence under Section 29(1)(e) of the Animal Welfare Act 2015 carries a fine of RM20,000 (S$6,000) to RM100,000, or imprisonment of up to three years, or both if found guilty.

The prosecution was conducted by Veterinary Services Department prosecution officer Mohd Zamri Ishak, while Yap was represented by Mr P. Rajagunaseelan.

During the trial, Mr Rajagunaseelan had requested that the court postpone the sentence to another day as Yap’s lead counsel G. Sritharan was not present.

Mr Sritharan is currently in the Philippines and will return to the country only on Sunday.

The court then set April 18 for the sentence hearing and submission of facts.

Earlier, Johor Baru North acting police chief Fariz Ammar Abdullah said a police report on the incident had been lodged at 2.59pm on March 27.

He said the incident was believed to have taken place near a veterinary clinic in Skudai. Yap’s actions were captured on closed-circuit television, which made the rounds on social media.

He subsequently apologised for his conduct and pleaded with the public to give him a second chance. THE STAR/ASIA NEWS NETWORK","JOHOR BAHRU - An 18-year-old Malaysian student who set a dog on fire in March has pleaded guilty to a charge of animal abuse at the Johor Bahru Sessions Court.

https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/swiss-researchers-use-typing-mouse-clicks-to-detect-office-stress,"Swiss researchers use typing, mouse clicks to detect office stress","GENEVA – The way people type and use their computer mouse can be better stress indicators than their heart rate, Swiss researchers said on Tuesday, adding that their model could help prevent chronic stress.

Researchers at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (ETHZ) said they had used new data and machine learning to develop a fresh model for detecting stress levels at work, based solely on the way people type or use their mouse.

“How we type on our keyboard and move our mouse seems to be a better predictor of how stressed we feel in an office environment than our heart rate,” said mathematician and study author Mara Nagelin.

For the study, the ETHZ researchers observed 90 participants in the lab performing close-to-reality office tasks, like planning appointments or recording and analysing data.

They recorded the participants’ mouse and keyboard behaviour as well as their heart rates, and regularly asked the participants how stressed they felt.

While some participants were allowed to work undisturbed, half the group were repeatedly interrupted with chat messages and were also asked to take part in a job interview.

They determined that stressed people type and move their mouse differently from relaxed people.

“People who are stressed move the mouse pointer more often and less precisely and cover longer distances on the screen,” Ms Nagelin added.

The researchers also found that people who feel stressed in the office make more mistakes when typing and tend to write in fits and starts, with many brief pauses.

Relaxed people by contrast take fewer but longer pauses when typing, they found.

Not a ‘monitoring tool’

The connection between stress, and keyboard and mouse behaviour can be explained through so-called neuromotor noise theory.

“Increased levels of stress negatively impact our brain’s ability to process information. This also affects our motor skills,” said psychologist and co-author Jasmine Kerr.

The researchers said it was urgent to find reliable ways of detecting heightened stress on the job, pointing out that one in three employees in Switzerland suffer from workplace stress.

“Those affected often don’t realise that their physical and mental resources are dwindling until it’s too late,” the researchers added.","GENEVA – The way people type and use their computer mouse can be better stress indicators than their heart rate, Swiss researchers said on Tuesday, adding that their model could help prevent chronic stress.

In its monthly rubber statistics report released today, chief statistician Datuk Seri Mohd Uzir Mahidin said NR production fell by 2.7 per cent year-on-year compared with 27,950 tonnes in February last year.

The local production of NR in February was mainly contributed by the smallholders sector at 87.3 per cent as compared to 12.7 per cent by estates sector.

“Total stocks of NR in February 2023 declined by 1.5 per cent to 191,636 tonnes from 194,563 tonnes in January 2023. Rubber processors factory contributed 90.6 per cent of the stocks followed by rubber consumers factory (9.3 per cent) and rubber estates (0.1 per cent),” he said.

Meanwhile, exports of Malaysia's NR amounted to 48,393 tonnes in February, an increase of 18.4 per cent against 40,867 tonnes in the preceding month.

China remained the main destination for NR exports which accounted for 56.9 per cent of total exports in February this year, followed by Germany (7.3 per cent), Turkiye (3.6 per cent), the United States (US; 2.1 per cent), and Egypt (1.5 per cent).

In addition, Mohd Uzir said the exports performance was contributed by NR-based products such as gloves, tyre, tube, rubber thread, and condom.

“Gloves were the main exports of rubber-based products with a value of RM0.99 billion in February 2023, an increase of 5.6 per cent as compared to RM0.93 billion in January 2023,” he said.

The average monthly price showed that latex concentrated recorded an increase of 7.3 per cent in February 2023 to 538.55 sen per kilogramme (kg) against 502.05 sen per kg in the previous month, while scrap climbed by 2.3 per cent to 474.50 sen per kg versus 463.84 sen per kg in January 2023.

Prices for all Standard Malaysian Rubber (SMR) rose between 1.2 per cent to 7.2 per cent.

Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department (Legal and Institutional Reform), Datuk Seri Azalina Othman Said said the website supplies information from verified sources such as historical documents, court proceedings, claimants’ attempts, related articles and government measures.

“This website will become an official platform for Malaysians and media practitioners (local and international) to obtain the latest development and facts in the ongoing arbitration dispute,” she said in a media briefing yesterday.

According to Azalina, the website will be made available in stages in five languages: English, Bahasa Malaysia, French, Spanish and Tagalog.

The website was launched today by Azalina, Foreign Minister Datuk Seri Zambry Abd Kadir and Communications and Digital Minister Fahmi Fadzil. — Screen capture of the website

The website is https://www.malaysia-sulucase.gov.my/ and it is currently available in English.

Azalina today said the Sulu claimants — who are seeking to enforce a US$14.9 billion (RM63 billion) arbitration award against Malaysia — are threatening the country’s sovereignty and security by making false statements that twist history and have harmed Malaysia’s image.

The Sulu claimants are currently seeking to seize Malaysia’s assets abroad and to threaten Malaysia into paying the RM63 billion arbitration award — the second-largest arbitration award in history, but Azalina said Malaysia views the arbitration to be invalid and also does not recognise the Sulu claimants to be the valid descendants of the Sulu sultan.

She pointed out that one of the Sulu claimants — Muhammad Fuad Abdullah Kiram — has already been declared by Malaysia to be a terrorist.

Apart from continuing to take legal action to defend Malaysia from the Sulu claimants’ actions, the new website will help fight the false claims by the Sulu claimants, she said.

The website is expected to be updated from time to time with new developments.

The website was launched today by Azalina, Foreign Minister Datuk Seri Zambry Abd Kadir and Communications and Digital Minister Fahmi Fadzil.

At the launch today, Zambry said the Cabinet had decided that the three ministries would work together as a team and to assist Azalina in the work in defending Malaysia’s sovereignty in relation to the Sulu claim.

“And for the ministry, specifically the Foreign Affairs Ministry, we will continue to give full support in ensuring Malaysia’s sovereignty is always preserved.

“In the context of our work, we will work together as a team and we will not separate duties and responsibilities. Any of our work whether internally or internationally, we will work together as a team,” he said.

He added that his ministry had already held preliminary discussions with Azalina and Fahmi on this matter and will ensure that work planned abroad would be carried out well.

At the same launch event, Fahmi said his ministry’s role is to assist in communications regarding the Sulu claim matter, including through the national news agencies.

“We assisted to make some assessments, particularly in terms of the communication plan as well as to provide support, particularly through our main agencies Bernama and RTM, and to make sure we assist in the overall narrative for the strategy that the government has chosen,” he said.

Azalina yesterday again called into question the legitimacy of the purported claimants, saying it is still undetermined whether the group were true descendants of Sultan Jamalul Kiram II to this date.

“Moreover, the claimants are going against the wishes of Sabahan to join Malaysia in 1963 as previously reported by the Cobbold Commission,” she said.

In 1963, the Cobbold Commission reported that North Borneo (now known as Sabah) had chosen to form the federation of Malaysia together with Sarawak and Malaya (now known as peninsular Malaysia).

Today, Azalina said that this means the Sulu claimants are ignoring the people of Sabah’s exercise of their right to self-determination to be part of Malaysia.","According to Azalina, the website will be made available in stages in five languages: English, Bahasa Malaysia, French, Spanish and Tagalog.

https://www.malaymail.com/news/money/2023/04/12/credit-suisse-rescue-receives-initial-snub-from-swiss-parliament/64377,Credit Suisse rescue receives initial snub from Swiss parliament,"BERN, April 12 ― Switzerland's parliament yesterday failed to approve the 109 billion Swiss francs (RM532 billion) of financial guarantees used to rescue Credit Suisse last month, in a first-round vote that was largely symbolic given the state had committed the funds.

The lower house retrospectively rejected the rescue near midnight, with heated debates continuing into the early hours of Wednesday morning as members discussed other measures related to Credit Suisse.

Earlier yesterday, Switzerland's upper house had approved the rescue, meaning the two chambers of the legislative body will vote again today.

Lawmakers were recalled for a rare extraordinary session to discuss the rapid rescue of Credit Suisse and the Swiss government's open chequebook response to a collapse that many in the country have blamed on top management.

A shotgun marriage which saw Credit Suisse taken over by Zurich-based rival UBS for 3 billion Swiss francs and propped up with more than 250 billion Swiss francs in guarantees and support has been the subject of widespread criticism.

While earlier in the day, 29 of Switzerland's 46-member Council of States upper house approved the measure, it was later rejected with 102 of the 200-Member National Council voting against it.

The votes are, however, largely symbolic because the state committed the funds and lawmakers cannot overturn that decision.

In the lead-up to the merger last month, Swiss emergency law was used so that a sub-group of six members of parliament approved the financial commitment on behalf of the legislative body, to the ire of the almost 250 lawmakers left without a say.

“The use of emergency law has reached a level in the last three years that is beginning to annoy me,” Hansjoerg Knecht, a member of Parliament's upper house, said.

Calling the situation where the legislative body can only approve the already committed credits “unsatisfactory”, Knecht said if Credit Suisse was to require more cash, there should be no use of emergency law to bypass parliament.

‘Lots of questions’

Switzerland's finance minister had addressed the Council of States before the vote and acknowledged the ire being voiced.

“I heard anger, I heard frustration, sometimes I also heard a bit of helplessness,” Karin Keller-Sutter said, adding that the merger between historic cross-town rivals Credit Suisse and UBS was not a forced marriage, but one of convenience.

She also there needed to be a discussion around the kind of financial centre Switzerland wanted to be and whether it wanted to continue playing in the top league globally.

“What kind of consequences does this have for the financial regulator? For politics? These discussions need to be had. What do we really want and if we want that, we won't get there without carrying certain risk in future as well,” she said.

A poll of Swiss economists found that nearly half thought the takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS was not the best solution, warning the saga had dented Switzerland's reputation.

Celine Widmer, a Swiss National Council member for the left-leaning Social Democrats told Reuters ahead of the vote that “lots of questions” needed to be answered.

Politicians also questioned why the Swiss financial regulator was unable to prevent Credit Suisse's failure.

“Does FINMA need stronger instruments or have they done a bad job?” Eva Herzog asked during a speech to the upper house.

Herzog is one of the six members of parliament who approved the rescue deal on behalf of the legislative body.

As part of the unusual event, the third such session in more than 20 years, the Swiss parliament had a chance to challenge the rushed rescue package and to discuss whether conditions could be imposed on Credit Suisse.

Last week, Switzerland announced it was cutting bonus payments for Credit Suisse's top management.

Credit Suisse's rescue angered not only politicians but many in Switzerland. A survey by political research firm gfs.bern found a majority of Swiss did not support the deal.

There are also growing worries about jobs and in an open letter to parliament, the Swiss Bank Employees' Association said that Credit Suisse and UBS must freeze any cuts. ― Reuters","The lower house retrospectively rejected the rescue near midnight, with heated debates continuing into the early hours of Wednesday morning as members discussed other measures related to Credit Suisse.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/england-health-service-nhs-catastrophic-doctors-junior-doctors-strike-3409696,Doctors in England start historic four-day strike over pay,"LONDON: Doctors working in England's public health service on Tuesday (Apr 11) launched what has been billed as the most disruptive strike in its history, in a dispute over pay and working conditions.

The four-day walkout, which began at 7am (6am GMT, 2pm Singapore time), follows months of strikes by other public and private sector staff as inflation sparks the UK's worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation.

The action by so-called junior doctors - physicians who are not senior specialists but who may still have years of experience - comes after a three-day stoppage last month and several strikes by nurses.

It threatens to be the most serious walkout yet and lead to the cancellation of hundreds of thousands of appointments.

They are demanding a pay rise of 35 per cent, which they say is needed to help make up for more than a decade of salary cuts in real terms.

They also argue pandemic backlogs coupled with staff shortages are massively increasing workloads, endangering patients.

""We have had a massive (pay) cut and we are filling more gaps because people are leaving,"" said junior doctor Katrina Forsyth, who added she sometimes wept after shifts.

""It's becoming less safe for patients,"" she said from a picket line after finishing a night shift at St. Thomas' Hospital in London.

The government maintains the BMA's request is unaffordable, as ministers try to dampen wage demands across the public sector amid stagnant growth and high inflation.

After slowing for three straight months, the Consumer Prices Index shot up to 10.4 per cent in February - close to 40-year highs and more than five times the target set by the Bank of England.

""I hoped to begin formal pay negotiations with the BMA last month but its demand for a 35 per cent pay rise is unreasonable,"" said Health Secretary Steve Barclay.

""If the BMA is willing to move significantly from this position and cancel strikes we can resume confidential talks and find a way forward, as we have done with other unions.""

""IMMENSE PRESSURES""

Barclay struck a deal last month with unions representing various health workers, including nurses, to increase pay by five percent.

Union members are currently voting on whether to accept it.

However, the deal does not cover junior doctors, who comprise around half of all NHS doctors, according to official figures.

Their latest walkout will pile ""immense pressures"" on the service, NHS England medical director Stephen Powis warned.

""This is a significant set of industrial action that's going to cause major disruption,"" he told BBC radio.

The strike affects the NHS in England but not in the UK's other regions.

Up to a quarter of a million appointments could be postponed, according to the NHS Confederation, which represents the system in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

Family doctors are also reported by British media to be closed for appointments for up to a week, as GPs are drafted in to provide cover.

Powis said the NHS is ""working very hard"" to ensure emergency services are staffed but that cover was ""fragile"" and ""routine care will be affected"".

Phil Sutcliffe, 75, of south London, was among those affected, with his cancer check-up appointment postponed to next month.

But he joined the St Thomas' Hospital picket line, organised by the British Medical Association (BMA).

""These doctors do the most fantastic job for very modest pay ... so the government needs to get to the negotiating table and start talking,"" he said.","LONDON: Doctors working in England's public health service on Tuesday (Apr 11) launched what has been billed as the most disruptive strike in its history, in a dispute over pay and working conditions.

https://www.malaymail.com/news/money/2023/04/12/jj-talc-unit-faces-scepticism-on-bankruptcy-settlement-support/64354,J&J talc unit faces scepticism on bankruptcy settlement support,"NEW YORK, April 12 ― A Johnson & Johnson company yesterday defended its second attempt to resolve talc lawsuits in bankruptcy, telling a US judge it can quickly build consensus around its US$8.9 billion (RM39.3 billion) settlement offer despite doubts about its assertion that 60,000 plaintiffs would support the deal.

The proposed settlement has divided lawyers representing cancer victims, many of whom claimed ahead of yesterday's court hearing before US District Judge Michael Kaplan in Trenton, New Jersey that J&J had created the illusion of widespread support for a deal that would deny plaintiffs just compensation.

Linda Richenderfer, an attorney for the US Trustee ― the US Department of Justice's bankruptcy watchdog ― said in court that J&J subsidiary LTL Management had not adequately explained its assertion that two-thirds of talc claimants would support the deal, especially given opposition from lawyers representing plaintiffs who were active in LTV's first bankruptcy.

“We just can't reconcile that with the numbers that were in front of us in the first bankruptcy case,” the DOJ's Linda Richenderfer said. “Where are these claimants coming from and who are these claimants?”

Kaplan said he shared Richenderfer's concerns, but would not take any action to stop LTL's second bankruptcy filing until he gets more information.

J&J faces more than 38,000 lawsuits that have been consolidated in federal court in New Jersey alleging that its talc products sometimes contained carcinogenic asbestos, and those cases have been on hold while LTL pursues a bankruptcy settlement. J&J has said its baby powder and other talc products are safe, do not cause cancer or contain asbestos.

In 2021, J&J divided its consumer business in two and offloaded the talc lawsuits onto a newly created subsidiary that almost immediately filed for Chapter 11, a tactic that could halt the lawsuits and force plaintiffs into a global settlement in bankruptcy court.

LTL's first bankruptcy case was dismissed as improper after the 3rd US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the company was not in “financial distress.”

LTL attorney Greg Gordon said at yesterday's court hearing that the second bankruptcy is different because the company has fewer assets available and more support for a bankruptcy settlement.

Lawyers for those who say use of J&J's talc products caused cancer on Tuesday spoke for and against the settlement, a day after a faction of plaintiffs alleged that J&J's settlement was “fraudulently and collusively” co-signed by plaintiffs' attorneys with “exaggerated” numbers of clients.

Gordon called that an “over the top accusation,” saying plaintiffs' support for the settlement is real and substantial. Any doubts about it could quickly be put to rest by allowing them to vote on the settlement, he added.

David Molton, who represented the official committee of talc claimants in LTL's first bankruptcy, said the second bankruptcy filing must be dismissed so that cancer victims can have their day in court.

“Hundreds of victims of J&J's products have died waiting for justice to be done,” Molton said.

Mikal Watts, who represents clients who support the deal, said that the settlement offers the first real chance for women with cancer to get a payout from J&J. The women should have a chance to vote on the existing deal, Watts said.

Gordon said LTL is “still getting a handle on” the total number of talc claims, but it believes it has support from two-thirds talc claimants.

LTL's proposed settlement would address not only the cases that are pending in federal court, but also cases that have not yet been filed.

It expects to file a formal bankruptcy plan by May 14. ― Reuters","“Where are these claimants coming from and who are these claimants?”Kaplan said he shared Richenderfer's concerns, but would not take any action to stop LTL's second bankruptcy filing until he gets more information.

https://www.malaymail.com/news/world/2023/04/12/kicking-off-philippines-drills-us-vows-defense-in-south-china-sea/64359,"Kicking off Philippines drills, US vows defense in South China Sea","WASHINGTON, April 12 — The United States yesterday promised to defend the Philippines in the dispute-rife South China Sea as the allies launched their largest-ever joint exercises in the face of Beijing’s growing assertiveness in the region.

Nearly 18,000 troops are taking part in the annual exercises dubbed Balikatan, or “shoulder to shoulder” in Filipino, which for the first time will include a live-fire drill in the South China Sea, which Beijing claims almost entirely.

The drills follow Monday’s conclusion of a three-day Chinese military exercise that simulated targeted strikes and a blockade of self-ruled, democratic Taiwan, which Beijing considers part of its territory.

In rare joint talks in Washington with their Philippine counterparts, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin discussed a deal reached last week for US forces to use a growing number of bases in the Philippines, including one near Taiwan.

Blinken said the United States affirmed its “unwavering commitment to standing with the Philippines against any intimidation or coercion, including in the South China Sea.”

The mutual defense treaty, signed in 1951 after the Philippines’ independence from Washington, “applies to armed attacks on either of our armed forces, our aircraft or public vessels, including our Coast Guard, anywhere in the South China Sea,” Austin told a joint news conference.

The United States and the Philippines plan new exercises in the South China Sea later in the year that will include other countries, Austin said.

He said the United States is allocating more than $100 million to the bases in the current fiscal year and that the United States would provide new military equipment to the Philippines including drones and air defenses.

Asked if the Philippines worried about China’s reaction, acting defense chief Carlito Galvez said, “We don’t expect any violent reaction considering that this exercise is intended for our collective defense.”

News of the expanded base access had prompted China to accuse the United States of “endangering regional peace and stability.”

“Countries in this part of the world must uphold strategic independence and firmly resist the Cold War mentality and bloc confrontation,” China’s ambassador to Manila, Huang Xilian, said last week.

Exercises in tense waters

Balikatan will include military helicopters landing on a Philippine island off the northern tip of the main island of Luzon, nearly 300 kilometres from Taiwan, and the retaking of another island by amphibious forces.

It will be the first time the exercises have been held under President Ferdinand Marcos, who has sought to strengthen ties with the United States after his predecessor Rodrigo Duterte trashed the alliance.

“In order for us to protect our sovereign territory, we really have to drill and exercise how we are going to retake an island that’s been taken away from us,” Philippine exercises spokesman Colonel Michael Logico told reporters after the opening ceremony at a military camp in Manila.

About 12,200 American, 5,400 Filipino and just over 100 Australian soldiers will participate in the two weeks of Balikatan exercises — about twice as many as last year.

The Americans will also use their Patriot missiles, considered one of the best air defence systems in the world, and the Himars precision rocket system, which has helped Ukrainian forces fighting the Russian invaders.

The two armies originally planned to fire live rounds at sea off the northern province of Ilocos Norte, about 355 kilometers from Taiwan’s south coast, but moved it farther down the South China Sea, Philippine Army Major-General Marvin Licudine said.

The original site was “not sufficiently prepared” for unloading the needed equipment, he said.

The new venue is less than 300 kilometres east of the Chinese-held Scarborough Shoal.

The exercises will enhance “tactics, techniques and procedures across a wide range of military operations,” said Philippine military spokesman Colonel Medel Aguilar.

About 50 leftwing protesters staged a rally outside the opening ceremony venue, calling on the Philippine government to scrap the exercises. — AFP","WASHINGTON, April 12 — The United States yesterday promised to defend the Philippines in the dispute-rife South China Sea as the allies launched their largest-ever joint exercises in the face of Beijing’s growing assertiveness in the region.

The 35-year-old Argentine World Cup winner left Barca in 2021 when the club could not afford to renew his contract and his PSG deal expires in June.

Amid whistles from PSG supporters who see Messi as a symbol of the club’s mistakes in chasing star signings instead of building a competitive team, Barcelona are openly courting the forward.

“Messi belongs to Barca and if he returns it would be something incredible,” said Lewandowski.

“We know that his place is here, in Barcelona. I don’t know what will happen, but I hope that next season we can play together.”

Messi is the club’s all-time top goalscorer and many consider him the best player in the history of football.

The playmaker scored a record 672 goals in 778 matches for Barcelona, winning 35 trophies, after joining the club at 13-years-old and developing at their feted La Masia youth academy.

Barcelona fans have chanted Messi’s name in the 10th minute — representing his former Barca shirt number — in their last two matches, including a 0-0 draw against Girona today in La Liga.

“Leo generates excitement, they have chanted his name in two games now, we’ll see what happens,” said Barca coach Xavi Hernandez after the derby clash.

Lewandowski, top scorer in Spain, could not find the net for the league leaders against Girona and, speaking at a charity event, said he had been carrying an injury.

“I took a blow from (Real Madrid defender Eder) Militao in the game against Madrid and I could not walk,” added Lewandowski, referring to Barcelona’s 4-0 thrashing by Los Blancos in the Copa del Rey last week.

A sign outside the barber shop advertised haircuts “from RM19”.

Domestic Trade and Cost of Living Minister Salahuddin Ayub said action can be taken against the barber under an anti-profiteering law if the allegation is true.

“If the allegation is true, let’s ensure that those involved will be strictly dealt with. Not only did they charge excessively, but such action tarnished Malaysia’s good name,” he told the Malaysian media.

“As a tourist destination, we should offer the best services and reasonable prices.”

The couple are a pair of YouTubers known as Zoe and Czar. They recently uploaded a two-minute video on their TikTok account that showed them in a dispute with a barber after he charged Czar RM120 for a haircut.

The couple said they went to the barber in the commercial Bukit Bintang area after seeing a sign that advertised haircuts from RM19.

After Czar had his haircut, they were shocked when the barber quoted him RM120.

“That’s more than what I paid in the UK,” Czar said in the TikTok video.

The couple claimed they overheard another foreigner being charged RM250 by another barber in the same shop.

Locals they asked told them that the price should not be more than RM50.

However, the barber insisted Czar had to fork out the amount because foreigners allegedly have to pay “additional taxes”.

The barber also attributed the price to the trimming of Czar’s beard, to which Zoe pointed out her partner “doesn’t have much facial hair”.

Summing up their experience, Zoe said it was unfair to assume foreigners have a lot of money and that “it is OK to charge us that much”.

“It gives people a bad impression,” she added.","Malaysia is investigating a claim by a British couple who said they were charged RM120 (S$36) for a haircut in Kuala Lumpur.

Suryakumar is the world's top-ranked Twenty20 batter but has found the going tough in recent times and was dismissed for three first-ball ducks in the home one-day series against Australia last month.

The 32-year-old managed 15 and one in his two outings for Mumbai, who will be looking for their first victory of the season when they face hosts Delhi Capitals later on Tuesday.

""There's going to be light at the end of the tunnel, he's going to be seeing that very soon,"" Shastri told the Cricinfo website ahead of the match.

""And when he sees that, he's going to grab it and make the most of it.

""So the advice to him would be just give yourself a little bit of time early on, even though it's T20 cricket.""

Known for his audacious strokeplay and 175-plus strike rate in T20 Internationals, Suryakumar tends to attack right from the word go but Shastri said he should take some time to find his feet at the crease.

""One good hit and you're on your way. That's what he needs - one good hit, and a little bit of time at the crease,"" he added.

""Not 20-30 minutes, maybe six balls or eight balls, and I think he'd be fine.""

Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting also felt Suryakumar needed to be backed ahead of India's campaign in the 50-overs World Cup on home soil later this year.

""Everyone around the world knows what Surya can do in white-ball cricket. They should stick with him, I feel,"" Ponting told the International Cricket Council website last week.

""Because he is, I think, the kind of player that can win you a World Cup.

""He might be a little bit inconsistent but he's the sort of guy who in big moments can win you something.""","""There's going to be light at the end of the tunnel, he's going to be seeing that very soon,"" Shastri told the Cricinfo website ahead of the match.
""And when he sees that, he's going to grab it and make the most of it.
""So the advice to him would be just give yourself a little bit of time early on, even though it's T20 cricket.""

This was the highest daily exit traffic recorded since land borders with Malaysia reopened about a year ago.

A surge of traffic was seen from last Thursday afternoon onwards, and there was heavy congestion at both checkpoints, said the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) on Wednesday.

Close to 1.4 million travellers cleared through the two land checkpoints over the long weekend period from April 6 to 9, ICA added. Good Friday fell on April 7 and the Qing Ming Festival started on April 5.

As more than one million travellers crossed the land checkpoints during the Good Friday weekend in 2019, the current figure is an indication that traffic has returned to pre-pandemic levels.

ICA said the tailback from Malaysia led to delays at Singapore departure points.

“Vehicular queues extended beyond the Seletar Expressway for Woodlands Checkpoint and along Ayer Rajah Expressway for Tuas Checkpoint,” it added.

The Straits Times earlier reported that live camera feed on the OneMotoring portal showed heavy congestion at both checkpoints throughout the day.

Checks in the evening showed that travellers crossing the Causeway were expected to take between six and seven hours to get into Malaysia, and those crossing at Tuas were expected to take between seven and eight hours.

ICA said it took several measures to help manage congestion and ease the movement of travellers. This included working with the Land Transport Authority and cross-border bus service providers to schedule more buses.

ICA also deployed more officers to areas where more support was needed and updated the traffic situation frequently on platforms such as its Facebook page and through local radio broadcasts.","SINGAPORE – More than 235,000 people left Singapore through the Woodlands and Tuas checkpoints on April 6, ahead of the Good Friday long weekend.

https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/basketball/trae-young-leads-hawks-into-miami-for-play-in-clash,Trae Young leads Hawks into Miami for play-in clash,"LOS ANGELES – Atlanta star Trae Young has some unfinished business when his Hawks team visit the Miami Heat on Tuesday night (Wednesday morning, Singapore time) for a National Basketball Association (NBA) Eastern Conference play-in game.

The winner will be the seventh seed in the play-offs, facing the Boston Celtics.

The loser will get a chance to earn the No. 8 seed and a date with the Milwaukee Bucks. To get there, they would have to beat the winner of the other Eastern Conference play-in game between the Toronto Raptors and Chicago Bulls.

Last season, the Heat eliminated Young and the Hawks from the play-offs’ first round in five games.

Young, who finished 10th in the league in scoring (26.2 points) this season, has struggled – relative to his overall numbers – throughout his career against the Heat.

In 17 career games versus Miami, he is averaging 21.4 points on 40.2 per cent shooting, including 32.8 per cent on three-pointers. In four games this season, he averaged 19.8 points on 35.6 per cent shooting, including 20.8 per cent from deep.

For his career against all teams, Young shot 43.7 per cent from the floor and 35.1 per cent from behind the arc.

Given all of that, it is no wonder Miami are 3-1 against Atlanta this season. On March 4, for example, Miami held Young to eight points on two-for-13 shooting as the Heat prevailed 117-109.

The Hawks closed their regular season with a 120-114 loss at the Celtics. It was a meaningless game in the sense that play-off seeding did not change with the result, and that fact was not lost on Hawks coach Quin Snyder.

“Our focus needs to go immediately to Miami,” he said after Sunday’s game. “We need to prepare.”

De’Andre Hunter was the only Hawks starter to play against Boston as Snyder rested his other regulars, including Young.

Heat coach Erik Spoelstra did something similar, resting leading scorer Jimmy Butler in Miami’s final two games. In addition, he did not use starters Bam Adebayo, Kevin Love and Tyler Herro in Miami’s loss at the Washington Wizards on Friday.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/imf-warns-deeper-financial-turmoil-would-slam-global-growth-3410691,IMF warns deeper financial turmoil would slam global growth,"WASHINGTON: The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday (Apr 11) trimmed its 2023 global growth outlook slightly as higher interest rates cool activity but warned that a severe flare-up of financial system turmoil could slash output to near recessionary levels.

The IMF said in its latest World Economic Outlook report that banking system contagion risks were contained by strong policy actions after the failures of two US regional banks and the forced merger of Credit Suisse. But the turmoil added another layer of uncertainty on top of stubbornly high inflation and spillovers from Russia's war in Ukraine.

""With the recent increase in financial market volatility, the fog around the world economic outlook has thickened,"" the IMF said as it and the World Bank launch spring meetings this week in Washington.

""Uncertainty is high and the balance of risks has shifted firmly to the downside so long as the financial sector remains unsettled,"" the Fund added.

The IMF is now forecasting global real GDP growth at 2.8 per cent for 2023 and 3.0 per cent for 2024, marking a sharp slowdown from 3.4 per cent growth in 2022 due to tighter monetary policy.

Both the 2023 and 2024 forecasts were marked down by 0.1 percentage point from estimates issued in January, partly due to weaker performances in some larger economies as well as expectations of further monetary tightening to battle persistent inflation.

The IMF's US outlook improved slightly, with growth in 2023 forecast at 1.6 per cent versus 1.4 per cent forecast in January as labour markets remain strong. But the Fund cut forecasts for some major economies including Germany, now forecast to contract 0.1 per cent in 2023 and Japan, now forecast to grow 1.3 per cent this year instead of 1.8 per cent forecast in January.

ECONOMIES AND INFLATION RESILIENT

US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told a news conference she was more optimistic about the outlook as a number of advanced and emerging market economies were showing resilience.

""I wouldn't overdo the negativism about the global economy,"" Yellen said. ""I think the outlook is reasonably bright.""

The IMF raised its 2023 core inflation forecast to 5.1 per cent, from a 4.5 per cent prediction in January, saying it had yet to peak in many countries despite lower energy and food prices.

""Monetary policy needs to stay focused on price stability"" to keep inflation expectations in check, IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas told a news conference.

In a Reuters interview, Gourinchas said central banks should not halt their fight against inflation because of financial stability risks, which look ""very much contained.""","WASHINGTON: The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday (Apr 11) trimmed its 2023 global growth outlook slightly as higher interest rates cool activity but warned that a severe flare-up of financial system turmoil could slash output to near recessionary levels.

Speaking to Eurosport on Monday, the 25-year-old felt that he was still able to turn the match around, despite trailing 7-6 (8-6), 6-6 when he was forced to retire.

Spanish veteran Nadal advanced to win his 14th Roland Garros crown, and 22nd Grand Slam title, after beating Norway’s Casper Ruud in the final in Paris.

https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/australianz/australia-s-new-city-tackles-climate-change-from-the-ground-up,Australia’s new city tackles climate change from the ground up,"SYDNEY – Carbon-neutral buildings and tree-lined streets are at the heart of plans for a brand-new city in a pocket of Australia where temperatures can be among the hottest on earth in the summer and climate change is a major threat.

Bradfield City Centre is under construction on an expanse of dirt and scrub about 56km west of Sydney’s Central Business District and harbour front, neighbouring a new international airport set to open in 2026.

The city and airport are part of the wider Aerotropolis, an area of about 11,000ha – around the size of 15,400 football fields.

The New South Wales state government hopes the development will “supercharge the creation of jobs and economic opportunities” in western Sydney, which is home to about 2.5 million people and has some of the fastest growth rates in Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries.

Backed by A$1 billion (S$889.3 million) from the government and more from a slew of international companies, it will be home to technology companies, colleges and, later, apartments and houses. The first building is set to be completed in 2024.

The new city comes as Australia has faced an increasing number of bush fires, floods and other extreme climate events in recent years, forcing developers to find ways to overcome or mitigate the impact of a warming planet.

At Bradfield, the immediate challenge is the area’s extreme summer temperatures, which can soar as much as 10 deg C higher than the city’s east, which is cooled by the ocean.

In January 2020, as wildfires ravaged Australia’s east coast, the temperature reached 48.9 deg C in the Sydney suburb of Penrith, about 22km from Bradfield, making it the hottest place in the world.

There is also concern that deforestation from construction in years gone by has left the area exposed to complications from global warming, such as accelerated soil loss and endangered native animal and plant species.

“The loss of greenery over the years makes this area very vulnerable to climate change,” said Associate Professor Tooran Alizadeh of The University of Sydney who is leading a research team to examine the new urban development. “This is a very sensitive area.”

Some 37 companies are already locked in as state government partners to construct Bradfield.

That list, which includes Northrop Grumman and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, is expected to expand to 50 by end-2023, according to Western Parkland City Authority chief executive Sarah Hill, who is overseeing the development.

Australia’s top science organisation, CSIRO, will also move some divisions into a purpose-built facility.

Dr Hill, who has spent her career designing city developments, including those for the 2012 London Olympics, said starting with a clean slate meant not having to fix problems further down the line.","SYDNEY – Carbon-neutral buildings and tree-lined streets are at the heart of plans for a brand-new city in a pocket of Australia where temperatures can be among the hottest on earth in the summer and climate change is a major threat.

The Italians, three-time winners, took a commanding quarter-final first leg lead at the Estadio da Luz, inflicting Benfica’s first defeat in the competition.

After an even first half, Barella headed home from Alessandro Bastoni’s cross and substitute Romelu Lukaku netted the second from the penalty spot late on.

Roger Schmidt’s Benfica, aiming to reach the semi-finals for the first time since 1990, were not able to put a glove on the visitors, who controlled the pace of the game.

Despite Inter’s poor form, they conjured a patient, professional display when they needed it most.

Having scored two goals in their previous five games across all competitions, they managed the same tally in Lisbon with clinical finishing.

“It’s been one of our best games this season,” Inter midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan told British broadcaster BT Sport.

“We were dominating all over the pitch. We were doubling up and were everywhere, helping each other and we got (rewarded) for it. We’ve done a great job.

“But it’s still not over, we still have to face them in a week and we know it’s not going to be easy.”

Neither side was able to create clear chances in a tight opening period.

The closest Benfica came was Andre Onana blocking a Rafa Silva drive after Federico Dimarco accidentally headed the ball into his path in the box.

Inter Milan defender Francesco Acerbi hammered over from 30 yards at the other end.

The Italians had the opportunity to hit the hosts on the break after half an hour, but Lautaro Martinez played a poor pass which was blocked, with 37-year-old target man Edin Dzeko alone in space.

Alex Grimaldo smashed an effort wide from distance, with Benfica frustrated and unable to get striker Goncalo Ramos involved.

With Inter pressing high up the pitch, the Eagles could not hit their flowing best, or anything close to it.

Impressive Inter

Inter Milan broke the deadlock early in the second half when Barella headed Bastoni’s looping cross back across goal and into the bottom corner.

The goal crowned a superb performance from the Italy international, while Inter’s defence kept a sixth clean sheet in nine Champions League matches this season.

Schmidt sent on David Neres for midfielder Florentino in search of the equaliser, but Inter doubled their lead with eight minutes remaining.

Joao Mario, one of Benfica’s best players this season, handled Denzel Dumfries’s cross, gifting his former side a penalty.

Lukaku drilled it beyond the reach of Greek goalkeeper Odysseas Vlachodimos, answering some criticism of his recent form.

Coach Simone Inzaghi had selected Dzeko ahead of Lukaku after the Belgian had missed gilt-edged chances in recent weeks, but he did not miss in a high-pressure moment.

Benfica might have pulled a goal back deep in stoppage time but Onana made a fine save to deny Ramos, who seemed poised to score.

“I said that we had to come here and play without fear because we could win — we did just that,” Onana told Uefa.

“But we cannot think that we are already in the semi-final because we are not. We still need another great game like today’s next week.”

The victory gives Inter a fine chance of setting up an all-Italian semi-final against Serie A leaders Napoli or city rivals AC Milan.

Inter, who beat another Portuguese side, Porto, in the last 16, host Benfica today April 19 at the San Siro in the second leg.

Benfica defender Antonio Silva said he believes his team can go to Milan and score three to produce a comeback.

“We deserved more and we had the opportunity for it, the fair result was a draw,” Silva told Portuguese broadcaster Eleven.

The striker knocked Real Madrid’s bitter rivals out of the Spanish Cup at Camp Nou, and, with the world watching on, issued a powerful statement of intent as the season reaches its business end.

Los Blancos welcome Chelsea tomorrow to the Santiago Bernabeu in a first leg Champions League quarter-final clash, and the Blues will be on red alert trying to stop the irrepressible Benzema.

Madrid, aiming to win the trophy for the sixth time in 10 seasons, have burst into life in recent matches, scoring 12 goals in their last three games, including the 4-0 romp against Barcelona.

They suffered a 3-2 defeat on Saturday in La Liga against Villarreal, but coach Carlo Ancelotti made six changes from the side that beat Barcelona to keep the likes of Toni Kroos and Luka Modric fresh to face Chelsea.

Benzema netted consecutive hat-tricks against Real Valladolid and Barcelona before that, like Madrid he is finding his best form at the crunch moments.

“He’s hit the switch,” said Ancelotti after the Clasico triumph.

“Working in the international break has helped him, he’s in good shape to make the difference.”

The Italian likened his team to a boiler, hitting the right temperature at the right time.

“When the team is close to a title, the temperature of the boiler goes up,” Ancelotti warned at the start of March.

Temperature rising

After the 4-0 win at Camp Nou which saw Madrid reach the Copa del Rey final for the first time since 2014, Ancelotti brought up the boiler again.

“The boiler has returned to the right temperature at the most important moment of the season,” he said.

Benzema’s own temperature has fluctuated this season, from moments of high quality to weeks sidelined with injury problems.

The 35-year-old Frenchman spent much of October and November on the sidelines and he missed the World Cup after sustaining a thigh problem.

Benzema failed to score a goal in the Champions League group stages but hit three against Liverpool across both legs of the last 16 clash.

Chelsea are familiar with the damage that the striker can do, with the striker netting a hat-trick last season at Stamford Bridge against the Blues in the quarter-finals in a 3-1 first leg win.

Despite Thomas Tuchel’s side battling back at the Bernabeu, the hosts forced the game to extra-time and Benzema headed home decisively in the 96th minute after Antonio Rudiger, now at Madrid, slipped.

It was a thrilling night of European football but despite Chelsea’s best efforts in a 3-2 win, Benzema and Madrid marched on — as they so often do.

Madrid went on to lift the trophy by beating Liverpool in the final in Paris. Now their sights are set on Istanbul.

“The truth is it was hard for us to be 100 per cent motivated, that’s quite normal,” said Ancelotti after Madrid loss on Saturday in La Liga.

The coach withdrew Benzema before the hour mark with his side 2-1 up against Villarreal, resting the striker for Chelsea’s visit.

Eventually Madrid fell to defeat, with their talisman only able to watch on from the sidelines.

“The temperature of the boiler went down a bit today,” admitted Ancelotti after the game, continuing his metaphor.

“But on Wednesday we will be flat out.” — AFP","MADRID, April 11 — When Karim Benzema struck a magnificent hat-trick against Barcelona last week in the Copa del Rey, it served a dual purpose.

At least 50 people, including children, were killed in Tuesday’s air strike on Pazigyi village in the Sagaing area in north-west Myanmar, according to media reports and a witness contacted by Agence France-Presse, as the United Nations and Western powers condemned the attacks and demanded accountability.

The South-east Asian country has been in chaos and its economy in tatters since the military seized power in a February 2021 coup.

Junta spokesman Zaw Min Tun told military broadcast channel Myawaddy the attack on the ceremony held by the National Unity Government (NUG), a shadow administration, for its armed People’s Defence Force (PDF), was aimed at restoring peace and stability in the region.

“During that opening ceremony, we conducted the attack. PDF members were killed. They are the ones opposing the government of the country, the people of the country,” said Mr Zaw Min Tun.

“According to our ground information, we hit their weapons’ storage, which exploded and people died due to that,” he added.

Referring to accusations of civilian casualties, he said “some people who were forced to support them probably died as well”.

UN rights chief Volker Turk said he was “horrified” by the deadly air strikes, whose victims he said included schoolchildren performing dances.

The global body called for those responsible to be brought to justice.

Mr Turk accused Myanmar’s military of once again disregarding “clear legal obligations… to protect civilians in the conduct of hostilities”.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres “strongly condemns the attack by the Myanmar Armed Forces”, according to a statement by his spokesman Stephane Dujarric.

Mr Guterres “reiterates his call for the military to end the campaign of violence against the Myanmar population throughout the country”, the spokesman added.

Washington said it was “deeply concerned” about the air strikes.

“These violent attacks further underscore the regime’s disregard for human life and its responsibility for the dire political and humanitarian crisis in Burma following the February 2021 coup,” State Department spokesman Vedant Patel said in a statement, using the country’s former name.

“The United States calls on the Burma regime to cease the horrific violence, allow unhindered humanitarian access, and to respect the genuine and inclusive democratic aspirations of the people of Burma.”

‘Great pain’

Sagaing region – near the country’s second-largest city, Mandalay – has put up some of the fiercest resistance to the military’s rule, with intense fighting raging there for months.

Graphic video clips circulating on social media – footage AFP has been unable to verify – showed bodies scattered among ruined homes.","The South-east Asian country has been in chaos and its economy in tatters since the military seized power in a February 2021 coup.

https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/south-korea-city-wildfire-fanned-by-strong-winds-evacuations-begin,Wildfire in South Korea forces 500 residents to evacuate as rain helps fight flames,"SEOUL – More than 500 people evacuated their homes in South Korea’s eastern coastal city of Gangneung as strong winds and dry weather fanned a wildfire on Tuesday, officials said, but fears of a further spread eased as rain helped firefighters battle the blaze.

The fire, which started at around 8.30am local time on Tuesday in Gangneung, was mostly extinguished as of 4.30pm, after consuming 170ha of land and prompting the evacuation of some 550 residents in the city of more than 200,000 people, the Korea Forest Service said.

The fire injured three people, including two firefighters, and destroyed dozens of buildings, the national forestry agency said. A body was found later in the afternoon in a burnt house in the affected area, Yonhap news agency reported, citing the Gangneung Police Station.

Firefighting crews had struggled to put out the fast-moving blaze due to strong winds, but rain then tamped it down by the afternoon.

The fire appears to have started after strong winds blew a tree onto live overhead power cables, igniting flames, Gangwon province’s Governor Kim Jin-tae said.

Photos and footage circulating on social media showed fires razing forests and fields, and buildings engulfed by smoke.

South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol ordered officials to mobilise all available resources to put out the fire as soon as possible and quickly evacuate nearby residents to minimise casualties, his office said.

Get your fix at Pasar Besar Taman Tun Dr Ismail's Jamilah Pie Shoppe,"KUALA LUMPUR, April 12 — I'm a pie fanatic. Since good home-baked pies are hard to come by, I'm always trying new ones I stumble upon, like those at this stall I found during a market jaunt.

It's run by two sisters; Jamilah is the one baking while sister, Samsiah, helps to sell the baked items. It's not just pies. You can also score quiches, egg tarts and scones.

What I like about their offerings is the small sizes makes it easier to sample a selection. It's RM4.50 per item. If you take three, it's RM12.

For the shepherd's pie, they do small as well as bigger portions. The larger-sized ones are RM10 per tray, making it a good choice to share among two or three people.

The pies mostly have savoury fillings. For the fully encased pies with pastry, there's beef or chicken.

The large-sized shepherd's pie is good for one greedy eater... or sharing.

I like both a lot as the beef has that savoury rich taste, while the chicken version has the creamy sauce with mushrooms that is just pure comfort for me.

Apparently, they also have a tuna pie, which I have yet to try. The pastry for these pies are beautifully flaky too.

On the sweet side, there's their apple pie. You may think that pie looks unattractive with its dark brown hue but it actually has molasses on the crust.

Find these chicken and beef pies at this stall at the wet market

This gives it an addictive caramelised edge that works so well with the diced apple filling. It's a nice balance of flavours too as the apple filling is not too sweet hence that touch of molasses gives it that much needed sweetness.

If you prefer another version, there's the apple crumble pie. Think jammy apples paired with a crumbly topping for another happy bite.

Don't miss out on the quiches. Select from the classic Quiche Lorraine which uses beef ""bacon"", mushroom, and spinach cheese.

There are creamy quiches with a tender crust and bursting with ingredients

All of them are good with a soft egg custard and they are generous with ingredients so each bite of the quiche is incredibly satisfying. The crust for the quiche is also tender too.

You also have a Portuguese egg tart and scones. The egg tart feels more like an ordinary one since it doesn't feature a bruleed top associated with the Portuguese version.

It's a good rendition though with a custard that is not too soft with a restrained sweetness and paired with a tender crust.

You can grab scones, apple pie and apple crumble here too

Even the scones are good with a tender crumb and it will be a good choice for afternoon tea with strawberry jam, clotted cream and a pot of hot tea.

On the day I visited, they only had the large sized shepherd's pie. Technically it's more of a cottage pie since it uses minced beef rather than the traditional minced lamb but that's just our Malaysian way.

For the shepherd's pie, you get a heavenly combination of creamy mashed potatoes with minced beef, carrots and herbs

As I bake my own shepherd's pie, I'm incredibly fussy about these types of pies. This one was an extremely good rendition that saw creamy mashed potatoes with a golden crust paired with minced meat cooked with diced carrots and herbs.

I can probably eat a whole rectangular tray since it's my ultimate comfort food! There's also a chicken version but I am always happier with the beef version.

As their shop is at Lot TS122, which is hidden inside the wet market, they have placed their pies for sale in front for better foot traffic.

The stall is located at the first floor of the TTDI wet market

The stall will close two days before the Raya holidays so if you want to get your pies, grab them for the long break. Orders can also be made for parties.

After the Raya holidays, you can get the pies fresh from the oven at their shoplot as currently the pies are baked off site.

“I think we lost something. Where is French democracy?“ one man shouted at the start of the event at the Nexus Institute. Other protesters in the audience targeted the pension law and climate change, while one displayed a banner that read: “President of violence and hypocrisy”.

Mr Macron, who was due to give a speech on European sovereignty, has faced weeks of tense protests at home against the pension law, which will delay the age at which French workers can retire.

Mr Macron competed for several minutes with those who were shouting in trying to make himself heard.

“I can answer this question, if you give me some time,” the President said.

“You vote and you elect people... the counterparty is you need to respect the institutions voted by the people,” he said.

“The day you consider, ‘When I disagree with the law... I can do whatever I want’... you put democracy at risk.”

Mr Macron then proceeded to give his speech.

Reporters in the room said the protesters were removed.

During his speech, Mr Macron defended the pension law, which will raise the retirement age by two years to 64.

“I will pass (retirement age) from 62 to 64,” he said, speaking in English. “When I compare, they (French protesters) should be less angry with me, because in your country it’s much higher, and in a lot of countries in Europe, it’s much higher than 64.”","THE HAGUE – Anger against an unpopular pension reform in France followed President Emmanuel Macron to the Netherlands, where protesters interrupted a speech he was giving on Tuesday at the start of a two-day state visit.

The question from the Islamist party PAS' lawmaker was submitted during the last Parliament session through a written question to Home Minister Datuk Seri Saifuddin Nasution Ismail.

""Is it true the government intends to grant recognition to citizens born after independence without taking into account skin colour?

""If true, what is the rationale?” Ismail’s brief question read.

In response to the question, Saifuddin said granting citizenship to individuals born before or after Malaysia’s independence is subject to the laws spelt out in the Third Schedule of the Federal Constitution, the Citizenship Rules 1964 and other relevant enforcement provisions.

He stressed that granting citizenship is the highest award and an exclusive right of the federal government which is not to be offered and given lightly.

""Every citizenship application received is processed and examined accordingly based on the conditions and laws that apply without distinction of ancestry or the skin colour of the applicant,” Saifuddin said.

In January, Saifuddin reportedly said the home ministry has set up a special committee to look into citizenship issues from all aspects in a comprehensive manner.

In a separate written question, Ismail also asked why a “state government” had demanded for mosques in the state use lower volumes for the ""azan"" call to prayers — to which religious affairs minister Datuk Mohd Na'im Mokhtar said no such thing exists.

Ismail was previously with Umno but he joined PAS in November 2022 after he was dropped from contesting the Maran seat of which he was the incumbent MP.

Ireland,"BELFAST, April 12 — US President Joe Biden was set today to promote the potential of enduring peace as well as business investment on his trip to Northern Ireland.

Following a late-night greeting in blustery weather from UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, Biden’s brief visit comes with the British-ruled territory again in the grip of political and sectarian squalls, 25 years on from a US-brokered peace agreement.

Biden was due to meet Sunak and Northern Ireland’s feuding political leaders in Belfast before delivering a speech at a newly opened city-centre campus of Ulster University.

The Irish-American president, 80, will then head on to the Republic of Ireland for a trip down memory lane, encompassing visits to the hometowns of his 19th-century ancestors.

Before boarding Air Force One, Biden said the priority for his trip was “to keep the peace” in Northern Ireland and help unlock its political paralysis.

His delegation includes a scion of the Irish-American Kennedy clan, Joe Kennedy III, Biden’s new special envoy for economic affairs in Northern Ireland.

Biden’s visit will mark the “tremendous progress” since the Good Friday Agreement ended armed conflict between pro-Irish and pro-British militants in April 1998, according to the White House.

“We’d like to see the national assembly (in Belfast) returned, clearly,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters aboard Air Force One, with the Stormont legislature currently suspended.

“The message is twofold. It’s congratulations on 25 years of the Good Friday agreement... (and) to talk about the importance of trying to work on trade and economic policies that benefit all communities as well as the United States,” he said.

Irish-American votes

Biden is likely to press the pro-UK Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) to resume power-sharing at Belfast’s Stormont assembly.

Devolved government in Belfast is a key plank of the 1998 accords, but it collapsed 14 months ago over the DUP’s trenchant opposition to post-Brexit trade arrangements in Northern Ireland.

DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson will urge Biden “to not make a political intervention but to encourage economic support”, hardline DUP lawmaker Ian Paisley Jr told Britain’s TalkTV.

Biden is already in campaign mode and playing up his Irish roots for US voters, Paisley said, noting the president would spend a full three days in Ireland.

“So I think we read into that, this is just a part of his campaign and we happen to be an opportunity along the road, we’re nothing more than that,” he said.

Sectarian violence remains a concern, with Britain’s MI5 security agency elevating its terrorism threat level for the territory ahead of Biden’s visit.

On Monday, masked youths pelted police vehicles with petrol bombs during an illegal march by hardline nationalists in Londonderry, which is also known as Derry.

Police in Northern Ireland on Tuesday said that four suspected pipe bombs were retrieved from a cemetery in the Creggan area of the city.

“All of these devices were located in the same area where clothes worn by participants in Monday’s unnotified Easter parade were removed under the cover of umbrellas and burnt,” officers said.

Biden has brushed off any security concerns, and will see up close how much redevelopment has transformed Belfast since 1998.

Biden’s five-star hotel in Belfast only opened in 2018.

Before 1998, the only place for visiting dignitaries to stay was the nearby Europa, which was attacked so often by the Irish Republican Army paramilitary group that it became known as the most bombed hotel in Europe. — AFP","BELFAST, April 12 — US President Joe Biden was set today to promote the potential of enduring peace as well as business investment on his trip to Northern Ireland.

Federal Counsel M. Kogilambigai, in her submission, told the High Court that the dispute in PBM is an internal matter for the parties to resolve.

“The court has no jurisdiction to hear the matter due to the ouster clause under Section 18C in the Societies Act 1966,” she said.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/jurong-point-subway-snatch-theft-illegal-remittance-court-jail-3412236,"Jail for man who helped steal S$30,000 in bungled illegal remittance deal at Jurong Point","SINGAPORE: Two men went to the Subway restaurant at Jurong Point to collect money from a customer of an illegal money exchange business, but when the man refused to hand over the cash, they stole a bag containing S$30,000 from him.

One of the two men was sentenced to three months' jail on Wednesday (Apr 12) for his involvement.

China national Chen Shuo, a 23-year-old machinist working for Ace-Z, pleaded guilty to one count of abetting theft by holding the man down so his accomplice could wrest the bag of cash away.

A second count of being involved in an illegal payment service business was taken into consideration.

The court heard that Chen assisted the mastermind of an unlicensed payment service business, exchanging Singapore dollars to Chinese yuan and vice versa.

The mastermind, 40-year-old self-employed Singaporean Tan Zhixian, used chat applications like Telegram and WeChat to publicise his illegal services and communicate with clients.

Chen was roped into the illegal business by 32-year-old China national Zhang Kexi, who worked at West Pharmaceutical Services.

Chen helped Tan and Kexi collect money from clients a few times before the incident occurred.

In January 2022, Kexi spoke to a customer on WeChat: Mr Zhang Renfei, a 39-year-old China national and Singapore permanent resident who was self-employed and sold crystals via livestreaming on Facebook.

Mr Zhang wanted to exchange S$100,000 to Chinese yuan. An agreement was made for a rate of S$1 to 4.8 yuan, and Mr Zhang was to provide S$100,000 to Kexi in exchange for receiving 480,000 yuan in his designated accounts in China.

After getting this request, Kexi informed Tan of the deal, but was told that they needed to see the money before making any transfers as the remittance transaction involved a large sum.

The plan was for Tan to remit 115,000 yuan to Mr Zhang's bank accounts in China and to collect a sum of S$24,109 from Mr Zhang first. If this went through successfully, the subsequent amount would be exchanged in three transfers.

On Jan 17, 2022, Kexi asked Chen, who was on leave, for help with the transaction.

Chen met Kexi near Jurong Point in the afternoon. They were supposed to meet Mr Zhang near a block of flats in the vicinity to get the cash, along with Kexi's colleague, 33-year-old China national Wang Anquan.

CUSTOMER'S RESERVATIONS, FEARS

However, Mr Zhang had reservations about meeting there as he was alone and holding onto a large sum of money.

The conspirators then wanted to meet Mr Zhang inside Jurong Point and take him to the block of flats, but Mr Zhang refused to leave the shopping mall, fearing for his safety.

Wang and Chen waited with Mr Zhang inside Jurong Point, until Wang had to leave for another appointment and was replaced by another colleague of Kexi's - 29-year-old China national Zhang Xichao.

After the 115,000 yuan had been transferred, the group told Mr Zhang about it. However, Mr Zhang said he had not received the money and refused to hand over any of the cash he carried in a paper bag.

Kexi, who had been handling the transaction and giving out instructions from elsewhere, went to join Chen and Xichao at Jurong Point.

Kexi asked for the S$100,000 in cash, as the agreed amount of 480,000 yuan would soon be transferred to Mr Zhang's accounts. However, Mr Zhang refused, claiming that he had not received any money.

Kexi called Tan to tell him what was going on, and Tan insisted that the 115,000 yuan transfer had been made. He told Kexi to obtain the equivalent sum of S$24,109 from Mr Zhang ""by hook or by crook"", or else Kexi would have to bear the responsibility for any losses sustained.

Kexi feared that the situation would escalate and got Xichao to leave with his sling bag containing cash from prior transactions.

Mr Zhang refused to hand over the cash and entered the Subway outlet at Jurong Point before calling the police for help, saying: ""Someone want to take my money. Three of them here.""

Kexi and Chen followed him into the shop and tried to take the money from him. A struggle ensued and Chen held Mr Zhang down while Kexi grabbed some money from the paper bag.

They then ran out of the mall with S$30,000.

Afterwards, Chen, Kexi and Xichao went to Geylang to eat and have a massage. Kexi paid for the others before taking a cab home.

The men involved in the incident were later arrested.

MONEY REMAINS UNRECOVERED: PROSECUTOR

The prosecutor asked for three months' jail for Chen. He said Chen had benefitted partially from expenditure arising from the snatched cash.

Even though S$26,050 was recovered, Mr Zhang still suffered a loss of S$3,950.

Although Chen did not know how much money Kexi wanted to take, he knew that Kexi intended to snatch at the very least the equivalent of the 115,000 yuan transfer. This was a sum that Mr Zhang repeatedly said he had not received.

It was a brazen crime that occurred in broad daylight in a public place, said the prosecutor.

The unveiling, which came on the heels of the launch of a slew of new AI products by SenseTime this week, was swiftly followed by the government’s publication of draft rules outlining how generative AI services should be managed.

In a filmed demonstration, the AI large language model, named Tongyi Qianwen which means “truth from a thousand questions”, drafted invitation letters, planned trip itineraries and advised shoppers on types of makeup to purchase.

Tongyi Qianwen will initially be integrated into DingTalk, Alibaba’s workplace messaging app and can be used to summarise meeting notes, write emails and draft business proposals. It will also be added to Tmall Genie, Alibaba’s voice assistant.

The technology “will bring about big changes to the way we produce, the way we work and the way we live our lives,” CEO Daniel Zhang told the livestreamed event.

AI models like Tongyi Qianwen are “the big picture for making AI more popular in the future,” he added.

The Chinese internet giant’s cloud unit plans to open up Tongyi Qianwen to clients so they can build their own customised large language models and began registrations on Friday.

The draft rules published by the Cyberspace Administration of China said the country supported the technology’s innovation and popularisation but content generated had to adhere to “core socialist values” as well as to laws on data security and personal information protection.

Those who fall foul of the rules could face fines or criminal investigation, it added.

The proposed rules, open for public comment until May 10, come as governments around the world are looking at how best to regulate generative AI technology, which has sparked much concern about its ethical implications as well as its impact on national security, jobs and education.

Italy last month temporarily banned ChatGPT — the chatbot sensation developed by Microsoft-backed OpenAI that has sparked the run of companies developing similar products.

Elon Musk and a group of artificial intelligence experts and industry executives have also called for a six-month pause in developing systems more powerful than OpenAI’s newly launched GPT-4, in an open letter citing potential risks to society.

Charlie Chai, an analyst from 86Research, said Beijing’s new rules would potentially slow down progress “in exchange for a more orderly and socially responsible deployment of the technology”.

They would also set up obstacles for foreign companies looking to provide AI services in the country, benefiting domestic companies, he added.

China has for years tightly censored its internet and its tech giants are careful to toe the line, especially on topics considered sensitive such as Chinese President Xi Jinping and the 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square.

Search engine Baidu’s Ernie chatbot — one of several AI models or chatbots revealed or teased by Chinese companies — declined to answer questions on such topics or asked to change the subject when quizzed by Reuters last month. The bot remains open only to trial users at the moment.

The sixth-ranked Olympic champions lost 2-1 to fifth-ranked France in their friendly in Le Mans on Tuesday, with several veterans missing, including midfielders Desiree Scott and Quinn, centre back Kadeisha Buchanan and forward Janine Beckie.

Beckie was ruled out of the quadrennial tournament after suffering an anterior cruciate ligament injury last month.

""In many ways as a coach you would like to get rid of the clutter early. I don't have that luxury,"" said Priestman.

""I'll be probably taking an extended group into the preparation camp and making a call from there because of the timelines on some of the injuries that we've got.""

Priestman said she would keep a close eye on upcoming National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) games and the rest of the European season.

""I have to try and get the best team possible to Australia and New Zealand,"" she said. ""(Planning) with and without some very critical players who, you know, did get us on the podium and have a massive amount of caps and experience.""

France, playing only their second match since Herve Renard was named head coach last month, scored minutes into the second half with a header by Grace Geyoro before substitute Lea Le Garrec added to their lead with a shot from outside the box.

OL Reign forward Jordyn Huitema scored for Canada minutes later with a shot into the bottom right corner.

""We've stretched ourselves and we've been stretched with the absences we've had,"" said Priestman, pointing to the level of competition France brought along with recent opponents at the SheBelieves Cup - Japan, Brazil and the United States.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/brazils-lula-puts-ukraine-peace-his-agenda-china-3411101,Brazil's Lula puts Ukraine peace on his agenda in China,"BRASILIA: President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva departed Brazil on Tuesday (Apr 11) for an official visit to China, where he aims to convince President Xi Jinping to form a group of nations to mediate an end to Russia's war with Ukraine.

Lula's visit, postponed from March for health reasons, aims to reset relations with Brazil's largest trade partner following a frosty four years under his far-right predecessor Jair Bolsonaro.

Lula is also seeking to put Brazil back on the international stage after a period of relative isolation by Bolsonaro, who spurned his country's traditional role in multilateral forums and drew criticism for not protecting the Amazon rainforest.

When he meets Xi on Friday, Lula has said he will suggest a proposal to mediate peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, an initiative that among Western leaders has only been welcomed by French President Emmanuel Macron.

""I am convinced that both Ukraine and Russia are waiting for someone else to say, 'Let's sit down and talk,'"" Lula told journalists last week.

Lula has suggested a peace solution could be the return of newly invaded territory, though not Crimea - an option that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has rejected outright.

For his initiative to advance, Lula needs China to send a message to Russia, said a European diplomat in Brasilia.

""Lula knows that China is the only country Russia will listen to,"" said the diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity and adding: ""People are waiting to see if it gets some traction from other countries, like France and Germany.""

Lula's foreign policy adviser Celso Amorim flew to Moscow in March to push for peace talks, and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov will visit Brasilia on Apr 17.

Before arriving in Beijing, Lula will visit Shanghai to attend the inauguration of former Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff as head of the New Development Bank set up in 2014 by the BRICS group of major emerging economies: Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.

Lula's trip to China was originally scheduled for the last week of March but postponed after he caught pneumonia.

""The fact that President Lula is to lead a large delegation to China for a state visit soon after his recovery fully reflects the great importance China and Brazil attach to this visit and to the development of bilateral relations,"" Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said on Tuesday.

Lula will travel with a delegation of eight cabinet ministers, including Environment Minister Marina Silva, and five governors from Brazil's northeastern states, including Bahia, where a Chinese consortium is building a record-breaking bridge.

Some 20 agreements to be signed include creation of a sixth satellite in a joint program started in 1988, which will be used for monitoring the Amazon, Brazil's foreign ministry said.

Brazil is also expecting China to set up a fund to help with forest recovery and sustainable development in Brazil, including green hydrogen production, Silva told Reuters.

Brazilian planemaker Embraer SA may sign a deal for the sale of 20 commercial jets to a Chinese airline, two people familiar with the matter said, ending the company's dearth of new business in China since the 2016 closure of a joint venture at a factory in Harbin.

China overtook the United States as Brazil's top trading partner in 2009 and is a major market for Brazilian soybeans, iron ore and oil. Brazil is now the largest recipient of Chinese investment in Latin America, driven by spending on high tension electricity transmission lines and oil production.

During the Bolsonaro presidency, many Chinese companies paused plans with the federal government and instead pushed ahead on business with state governments, especially in the less affluent northeast where Lula's Workers Party is strongest.

By 2021, investment by Chinese companies in Brazil recovered to the level of 2017, according to the China-Brazil Business Council, which forecasts steady growth in coming years.","""I am convinced that both Ukraine and Russia are waiting for someone else to say, 'Let's sit down and talk,'"" Lula told journalists last week.

And the horror comedy Renfield - which opens in Singapore cinemas on Thursday – finds the infamous vampire’s long-suffering servant, R.M. Renfield (Nicholas Hoult), in the midst of a full-blown career crisis.

In exchange for his loyalty, Dracula (Nicolas Cage) has made Renfield immortal, and given him superhuman strength and fighting skills, which the henchman can activate by eating insects and other creepy crawlies.

Chatting to The Straits Times and other media over Zoom, English actor Hoult, 33, says: “The interesting thing about the relationship is they did have good times and they do care for each other.”

But after more than a century on the job, which means procuring victims for his egomaniacal lord and tending to his other dark needs, Renfield’s heart is no longer in it.

And he begins to realise his relationship with Dracula is rather dysfunctional, especially when he meets Rebecca (Awkwafina), a brave police officer in New Orleans, where Renfield is cruising for victims as he nurses an ailing Dracula back to health.

To prepare for the role, Hoult read the 1897 novel on which the film is based: Bram Stoker’s Dracula, which introduces Renfield as a character.

He also watched the 1931 classic film Dracula, and “stole what I could” from the late American character actor Dwight Frye’s performance as Renfield.

In addition to doing extensive fight training for the movie’s blood-soaked action scenes, Hoult decided to fully commit to one of the most memorable details from the book.

“In the classic novel, Renfield gets some of his life force from eating flies. In our story, he gains momentary power whenever he eats bugs,” he says.

“I was lucky. The props department was brilliant and they created some caramel cockroaches that were delicious and the worms were just (the candy) Gummi Worms. But I did eat real crickets,” adds the former child star. Hould had his breakthrough in the 2002 Hugh Grant comedy-drama About A Boy and later picked up an Emmy nomination playing Russian emperor Peter III in the historical comedy The Great (2020 to present).

“They were dried out, though – and with salt-and-vinegar and barbecue flavours – so they were pretty tasty. The only bug I ate that I didn’t like was a potato bug. That one tasted kind of dirty,” he says with a laugh.","And the horror comedy Renfield - which opens in Singapore cinemas on Thursday – finds the infamous vampire’s long-suffering servant, R.M.

https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/fox-news-has-credibility-problem-after-media-mogul-rupert-murdoch-s-disclosure-us-judge,Fox News has ‘credibility problem’ after media mogul Rupert Murdoch’s delayed disclosure: US judge,"WILMINGTON – A judge in the United States said that Fox News had a “credibility problem” just days before a US$1.6 billion (S$2.1 billion) defamation trial after the company disclosed for the first time in nearly two years of litigation that media mogul Rupert Murdoch was an officer of the company.

Superior Court Judge Eric Davis called the delayed disclosure “bizarre” and chided Fox attorneys for having previously made representations that Mr Murdoch wasn’t an officer of Fox News, only to reverse on the eve of a trial set to begin Monday over the broadcaster’s coverage of false claims the 2020 presidential election was rigged.

“I’m not very happy right now,” Judge Davis said during a hearing in Wilmington, Delaware. “You (Fox News) have a credibility problem.”

Dominion Voting Systems alleges Fox damaged its business by Fox knowingly and repeatedly airing false claims that Dominion machines were used to flip the 2020 US presidential election against former president Donald Trump, a Republican, and in favour of Democrat Joe Biden, who won.

An attorney for Dominion, Mr Justin Nelson, said his client only learned of Murdoch’s role on Sunday and got its first document with Mr Murdoch’s title of Fox News executive chairman on Tuesday morning.

Mr Murdoch, chairman of Fox News parent company Fox Corp, is expected to testify in court.

Dominion says that depositions by Mr Murdoch and others, as well as troves of internal Fox communications, prove top network personnel knew the election-rigging claims were false but aired them anyway to appease Fox’s conservative viewers.

Fox News had disclaimed that Murdoch was a company officer, which shaped how Dominion litigated the case, according to Dominion attorney Mr Nelson.

As a Fox News officer, Murdoch would likely have been subject to more probing discovery by Dominion.

“It is very troubling, but this is where we are,” Mr Nelson said.

A Fox lawyer told the hearing that Murdoch disclosed the title in a February deposition and he called the title“honorific.”

“Rupert Murdoch has been listed as executive chairman of Fox News in our SEC filings since 2019 and this filing was referenced by Dominion’s own attorney during his deposition,” said a statement from Fox.

In 2019, when Fox Corp was formed from some assets of the former 21st Century Fox, Mr Murdoch was described in Fox’s proxy as the executive chairman of the news business.

Fox News did not immediately respond to a question why Mr Murdoch’s executive chairman role was excluded from earlier court filings.

Determining who knew what when and how much power they had over Fox coverage is likely to be a critical task for jurors, who will start being selected on Thursday ahead of opening statements on Monday.

Dominion’s Mr Nelson said at Tuesday’s hearing that the company was still trying to determine what action if any it would ask of the judge for the delayed disclosure. REUTERS","Mr Murdoch, chairman of Fox News parent company Fox Corp, is expected to testify in court.

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/boy-who-allegedly-committed-obscene-act-on-cat-arrested,Boy who allegedly committed obscene act on cat arrested,"SINGAPORE – The police have arrested a teenage boy after a video of a cat being abused in Bukit Panjang went viral.

In response to queries, the police said they made the arrest after they received a report on an alleged case of obscene acts along Senja Road at 12.10am on Tuesday. It added that investigations are ongoing.

In a 56-second video that was circulated on Monday night, a boy is seen trying to perform obscene acts on the feline outside a Housing Board flat.

Despite the cat moving away, the boy is seen going after the animal, carrying it and continuing to carry out such acts against it.

He also appears to grab the cat’s tail for at least six seconds afterwards.

According to the time stamp on the closed-circuit TV surveillance footage, the incident happened just before 2am last Saturday.

The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) called the contents of the video “deeply distressing”.

It said that it had reported the incident to the authorities after being alerted to the video by a member of the public, and had reached out to the cat’s owner to offer him support.

SPCA executive director Aarthi Sankar added: “The contents of the video are deeply distressing and raise concerns about the rising number of animal abuse and welfare cases, including incidents involving minors in recent years.

“As the SPCA continues to focus our efforts towards education and advocacy, we urge parents and educators to underscore to their children the importance of treating all animals as sentient beings.”

First-time offenders who commit an act of animal cruelty can be fined up to $15,000, jailed up to 18 months, or both.

Repeat offenders face a maximum fine of $30,000, a jail term of up to three years, or both.

If the offender is above 16 years old and below 21, the court can call for a pre-sentence report to decide if he is suitable for probation or the reformative training centre.

The court can also call for a report to assess the boy’s suitability for Mandatory Treatment Order (MTO). Those given an MTO undergo treatment for their mental condition in lieu of jail time.","SINGAPORE – The police have arrested a teenage boy after a video of a cat being abused in Bukit Panjang went viral.

https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/taiwan-president-slams-irresponsible-china-military-drills,Chinese navy ships remain around Taiwan after drills end,"TAIPEI - Chinese warplanes and navy ships were still in the waters around Taiwan despite ending three days of war games, the island’s defence ministry said on Tuesday, as Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen criticised Beijing for its “irresponsible” behaviour.

China began the war games on Saturday, after Ms Tsai returned to Taipei following a meeting in Los Angeles with US House of Representatives Speaker Kevin McCarthy.

China, which had warned the United States not to allow Ms Tsai to visit or meet Mr McCarthy, regards Taiwan as a renegade province to be reunified, by force if necessary. Taiwan’s government strongly disputes China’s claims.

Although China said on Monday night the drills had ended, Taiwan’s defence ministry said it had spotted nine Chinese ships and 26 aircraft, including J-16 and Su-30 fighters, carrying out combat readiness patrols around the island late on Tuesday morning.

Taiwan’s air force, navy and shore-based missile crews are closely monitoring and responding, it added.

Taiwan’s government has repeatedly denounced the drills, but said it will not escalate or provoke.

Writing on her Facebook page shortly before midnight on Monday, Ms Tsai said that as President, “I represent my country to the world”, and that her visits abroad, including stops in the US, are not new and what Taiwan’s people expect.

“However, China used this to launch military exercises, causing instability in Taiwan and the region. This is not a responsible attitude for a major country in the region,” she said.

China simulated precision attacks and blockades of Taiwan during the drills, sending up dozens of fighter jets and bombers.

Taiwan’s defence ministry said that on Monday, 91 Chinese military aircraft flew in missions around the island.

Taiwan’s official Central News Agency said that this was a record, though the ministry said it could not verify whether that was the case.

The ministry published a map showing that on Monday, Chinese aircraft crossed the Taiwan Strait’s median line, which normally serves as an unofficial barrier, to its north and centre.

It also showed 15 carrier-based J-15s, most likely flying from China’s Shandong aircraft carrier, flying east of Taiwan.

Taiwan has been tracking the Shandong in the Western Pacific since last week.

Reuters reporters on the coast near the Chinese city of Fuzhou on Tuesday saw separate and much more low-key drills taking place, with a warship firing at targets.

Those exercises were announced before China’s massed drills around Taiwan. Fuzhou sits close to the Taiwan-controlled Matsu islands.

Ms Tsai said that Taiwan’s armed forces and coast guard reacted calmly and professionally, and she thanked everyone involved.

“Although China’s military exercises have come to an end, the nation’s military and national security team will continue to stick to their posts and defend the country,” she added.

The exercises have also caused concern in Japan, especially as its southern islands sit close to Taiwan and could become caught up in a conflict.

The Japanese island of Okinawa is host to a major US Air Force base, and last August, when China staged war games to protest the visit of then US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taipei, Chinese missiles landed within Japan’s exclusive economic zone.

Japan’s Defence Minister Yasukazu Hamada on Tuesday described China’s military drills around Taiwan as “intimidating training” to seize sea and air control around the island.

China appeared to have shown an “uncompromising attitude” regarding Taiwan issues through the drills, Mr Hamada told reporters.

Life in Taiwan has continued as normal despite the tensions, with no signs of panic or disruption, and civilian flights around the island, including over the Taiwan Strait, were also uninterrupted.

Both Taiwan’s ruling and opposition parties, in a rare show of unity, put out a joint statement from their Parliament caucuses condemning the drills.

“The people and government of Taiwan have the right to conduct normal exchanges with other countries and contribute to the international community through international participation,” the statement said.

“The Chinese authorities have no right to obstruct and cannot change the strong will of the Taiwanese people to go out into the world.”

China responded to questions about Tuesday’s military presence by reiterating its claim over Taiwan.

“China will resolutely take strong measures to protect national sovereignty and territorial integrity,” foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said at a regular press briefing.

“Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory. There is no so-called Taiwanese defence ministry.”

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/analysis-japans-upbeat-wages-may-keep-new-boj-chief-hook-policy-tweak-3409741,Analysis: Japan's upbeat wages may keep new BOJ chief on hook for policy tweak,"TOKYO : Japan's new central bank governor Kazuo Ueda says he is in no rush to shift away from the radical monetary stimulus of his predecessor, but wage pressures may force him to make the policy tweaks faster than he'd like.

Ueda, who commenced his new role at the bank this week, is widely expected by markets to take Japan out of the extremely accommodative monetary settings introduced by previous governor Haruhiko Kuroda in recent years - the only question is when he might do this.

While the extremely low interest rates and complicated policy framework of the Kuroda era are deeply unpopular with the financial sector and the wider public, Ueda has to date been publicly cautious in his guidance, saying current settings remain appropriate for now.

However, a widely expected upgrade in the Bank of Japan's price forecasts due this month may show inflation staying near 2 per cent for several years.

Analysts say that could rekindle market expectations of a change to yield curve control (YCC), a policy that caps the 10-year bond yield around zero and has drawn criticism for distorting markets and hurting banks' margins.

Ueda's comments on Monday warning of the danger of being too late in normalising policy also suggest a near-term tweak to YCC was not off the table, said Naomi Muguruma, senior market economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.

""The BOJ will probably upgrade its price forecasts this month. In doing so, it could offer new guidance on future policy and tweak YCC around summer or autumn,"" she said.

MANAGING EXPECTATIONS

In his confirmation hearing to parliament in February and Monday's inaugural news conference, Ueda vowed to sustain Kuroda's massive stimulus programme including YCC, which tempered market bets of an immediate policy shift.

Having battled Japan's debilitating deflation as BOJ board member two decades ago, Ueda stressed the need to wait until budding signs of wage growth become sustained, and help inflation stably meet the central bank's 2 per cent target.

But big wage hikes pledged by major firms this year and a rebound in private consumption heighten the chance inflation will remain elevated, analysts say, casting doubt over the BOJ's view that sustained achievement of 2 per cent inflation remains elusive.

Ueda may need to find a new reason to keep ultra-loose policy if the BOJ's fresh quarterly forecasts, due at his debut meeting on April 27-28, show inflation hovering around 2 per cent in the next three years.

The BOJ has said it was focusing more on trend inflation driven by domestic demand, and in doing so was looking closely at core-core consumer inflation - an index that strips away the effect of volatile fresh food and energy.

Under the assumption that solid economic growth will prod firms to raise wages and inflation, the BOJ currently expects core-core inflation to hit 1.8 per cent in the fiscal year that began in April before slowing to 1.6 per cent the following year.

With more firms hiking prices and employees' pay, the BOJ may revise up the forecasts and see inflation stay around 2 per cent through fiscal 2025, analysts say.

Even if the BOJ decides to stand pat in April, the release of more thorough wage data around mid-year, which covers smaller firms, may give policymakers reason to consider tweaking YCC.

""Wages are rising and domestic demand is firm. It's hard to find any reason to downgrade the BOJ's rosy scenario projecting a wage-inflation cycle kick off in coming years,"" said Seisaku Kameda, a former top BOJ economist with experience drafting the central bank's growth and inflation projections.

""The BOJ may see scope to tweak YCC as early as June,"" he said. ""Ueda hasn't ruled out modifying YCC. He's just saying any first step he takes won't be a big leap towards an exit.""","However, a widely expected upgrade in the Bank of Japan's price forecasts due this month may show inflation staying near 2 per cent for several years.

The firm debut by Harita Nickel could boost sentiment surrounding upcoming IPOs in Indonesia, which is one of the world's hottest IPO markets this year on a drive by the government to privatise some state-owned enterprises. Harita Nickel's stock opened at 1,285 rupiah per share, slightly higher than its initial public offering (IPO) price of 1,250 rupiah a share, on the Indonesian stock exchange.

It climbed as high as 1,410 rupiah a share, then dropped to as low as 1,205 rupiah before trading at around 1,290 rupiah, while the local benchmark stock index was down 0.3 per cent.

TBP CEO Roy Arman Arfandy said the retail portion of the share sale was doubled to 5 per cent of the total issue.

""There was quite a lot of oversubscription, because the demand was very high,"" Roy told reporters at the company's market debut ceremony on Wednesday.

The IPO comes at a time when nickel-rich Indonesia steps up efforts to become a major player in the electric vehicle industry. Harita Nickel's peer Merdeka Battery Materials is scheduled to debut on the local bourse next, on April 18, after raising 8.75 trillion rupiah.

New share sales more than quadrupled in Indonesia to $828.1 million in the first quarter from the same period last year, according to Refinitiv data.

""We are really excited about the region, because countries like Indonesia and countries like Thailand - these are places where you see real growth coming back in a very meaningful way,"" said Sunil Khaitan, Southeast Asia's Managing Director and Head of Equity Capital Markets at Bank of America in Singapore.

Other upcoming IPOs in Southeast Asia's largest economy this year include the planned listing of the upstream arm of state energy company Pertamina, Pertamina Hulu Energi, that could raise up to $2 billion, and state-owned fertiliser company Pupuk Kalimantan Timur that could raise $500 million.

Harita Nickel's IPO was the largest in Indonesia in almost a year after the $1.1 billion listing of tech firm GoTo in April.

The miner will use the IPO proceeds to repay oustanding loans, and for capital spending and working capital, according to its IPO prospectus.

It is part of Jakarta-headquarted Harita Group, whose main businesses range from palm oil plantations to smelters.

BNP Paribas, Citigroup, Credit Suisse and Mandiri Sekuritas are the joint global coordinators and bookrunners of the IPO with DBS, OCBC and UOBKayHian, according to its prospectus.

The Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) said that the tanker Success 9 had 20 crew onboard of various nationalities, and one of them was Singaporean.

The MPA said it was working closely with the ship owner, the Monrovia Regional Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre and the Information Fusion Centre at the Changi Command and Control Centre to monitor the situation and render the necessary assistance.

No further details were given, including the nationalities of the other crew members.

An Ivorian security source involved in the matter said a patrol boat had been sent out to rescue the tanker, but was unable to locate it because its beacon had been turned off.

“We think it’s an act of piracy because the modus operandi is the same,” the source, who did not wish to be named, told Reuters.

“We have sought external help from Spain and from Europe,” the source added.

""It was not comfortable at all, emotionally I'm destroyed,"" he said, prompting laughter. ""I (aged) 10 more years today.""

Nevertheless, City took a huge step towards a first Champions League title with a 3-0 victory over the visiting German powerhouse in the first leg of the quarter-finals.

Scoring machine Erling Haaland netted his 45th goal of the campaign, a single-season record for a Premier League player, in his maiden campaign. Rodri, with a highlight-reel strike, and Bernardo Silva also scored, taking City's extraordinary goal differential to 34-3 in their last nine games.

Still, Guardiola said there would be no resting easy until they have faced his former team at Allianz Arena next Wednesday.

""To knock out these teams you have to have two good games, not one,"" the Spaniard said.

Bayern manager Thomas Tuchel agreed.

""Football is football, a home match in Germany is a home match in Germany, and it will not be over until we're in the shower,"" said Tuchel, whose Chelsea side won the European Cup in 2021 in City's lone appearance in the final.

Tuesday's game in blustery rain was tight until midway through the second half. Both keepers were kept busy.

""Part of the game they were better than us,"" Guardiola said. ""The second half, after we adjusted something, and in the last part of the game, the last minutes of the game, we were better, we scored three fantastic goals, we had more chances.

""Yes, an incredible result, but I know a little bit what it means at Allianz Arena ... I've been there many, many times, three years (as manager) there and I know in Europe this team is special.""

Tuchel took over as Bayern boss last month after the surprise sacking of Julian Nagelsmann.

The new manager stressed to his players not to focus on Tuesday's result.

""Because I think it's not a deserved result. It does not tell the story of this match,"" Tuchel said.

""That will be the challenge, to focus on the things that we did good. We played with personality we played with courage, we played with the right attitude and played with a lot of quality.""

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/tait-backs-frustrated-warner-find-attacking-gear-ipl-3412281,Tait backs frustrated Warner to find attacking gear in IPL,"Delhi Capitals skipper David Warner has cut a frustrated figure during the Indian Premier League despite notching three fifties in four games and former Australia pacer Shaun Tait says the batting anchor is itching to rediscover his swashbuckling style.

Warner is second in the batting charts with 209 runs from four games behind Punjab Kings batter Shikhar Dhawan (225), who has played a match less, but it is the Australian's strike rate of 114.83 that has raised eyebrows.

Dhawan's strike rate is 149 and Warner's figure is the lowest of the top nine batters.

After scoring 56 off 48 balls against Lucknow Super Giants, Warner made 37 off 32 against Gujarat Titans, 65 off 55 against Rajasthan Royals and 51 off 47 in Tuesday's six-wicket loss to Mumbai Indians.

""You can quite clearly see on his face and his reactions after shots or missed shots, that he's pretty frustrated as well,"" Tait told cricket website ESPNCricinfo.

""The only reason that's acceptable is because other guys around him have been pretty poor as well. Because he's such a great player, he manages to score and lead the runs.

""With David getting towards the end of his career, maybe that's the thing. With such a great player, a legend of the game, you expect him to come out of that and go back to something we're used to.""

Tait said there was a lot of ""shanking"" and several mishits from Warner, 36, against Mumbai as Delhi crashed to a fourth straight defeat to sit bottom of the IPL.

https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/north-korea-parade-probably-oversells-icbm-threat-leaked-document,North Korea parade ‘probably oversells’ ICBM threat: Allegedly leaked US document,"WASHINGTON – US intelligence analysts believe a recent military parade in North Korea “probably oversells” the threat its intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) pose to the United States, according to a leaked document purportedly from the US government.

Reuters has reviewed more than 50 of the documents, labelled “Secret” and “Top Secret”, that first appeared on social media sites in March and supposedly reveal details of military capabilities of some US allies and adversaries.

Reuters has not independently verified the documents’ authenticity.

While the Pentagon has not vouched for the authenticity of each of the documents, it said on Monday there appeared to have been an “unauthorised disclosure of classified material”.

It said photos appear to show documents similar in format to those used to provide daily updates to senior leaders, though some appear altered.

A brief, one-paragraph observation in one of the documents marked “Secret” and seen by Reuters noted that North Korea had paraded an unprecedented number of ICBM-class launchers that were “most likely carrying non-operational systems” at an event on Feb 8.

The Pentagon and North Korea’s mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the part of the documents concerning North Korea.

The document said the North Korean aim was “probably to portray a maturing nuclear threat to the US”.

“The North paraded these non-operational systems to portray a larger, more capable missile force than it possesses and to mitigate the risk of damage to its real missiles,” the document said.

North Korea continues to develop its ballistic missile programme, test-launching dozens of advanced missiles in 2022 despite United Nations Security Council resolutions and US-led sanctions. It has continued the testing in 2023.

The document added that during the next year, “North Korea will probably be unable to outfit all of the paraded ICBM-class TELs with operational missiles capable of striking all of the US because of testing hurdles and resource constraints”. TEL is an acronym for transporter erector launcher, a mobile missile-launch vehicle.

Imagery published by North Korean state media of the Feb 8 event showed more purported ICBMs than Pyongyang has displayed before and hinted at a new solid-fuel weapon.

The images showed as many as 11 Hwasong-17s – North Korea’s largest ICBMs, which are suspected to be capable of striking nearly anywhere in the world with a nuclear warhead.","WASHINGTON – US intelligence analysts believe a recent military parade in North Korea “probably oversells” the threat its intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) pose to the United States, according to a leaked document purportedly from the US government.

https://www.malaymail.com/news/singapore/2023/04/12/wwf-singapore-pilot-project-involving-15000-parcel-deliveries-shows-reusable-packaging-commercially-viable-for-e-commerce/64368,"WWF-Singapore: Pilot project involving 15,000 parcel deliveries shows reusable packaging commercially viable for e-commerce","SINGAPORE, April 12 — A pilot study here has found that reusable packaging is commercially viable for e-commerce with three out of 12 participating retailers pursuing the option after identifying potential cost savings.

The six-month study was done by World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) Singapore along with United Overseas Bank (UOB), DHL Consulting, SingPost and Better Packaging Co.

In all, 15,000 customer transactions were processed during the pilot, with one in three of them choosing reusable packaging.

The pilot found that customers made a sustainable choice by opting for reusable packaging because they were concerned about the environment and not based on supporting eco-friendly brands.

Another key finding was that incentives alone were not a large enough factor in a customer’s decision to opt in for reusable packaging, though they said that the right incentive can further motivate them.

A study done by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that boxes and plastic packaging account for 45 per cent of carbon emissions in the e-commerce supply chain.

Every year, e-commerce contributes a total of 17.7 million kilogrammes of packaging waste. In 2021, it was reported that at least 200,000 e-commerce parcels were shipped daily in Singapore.

The growing waste problem prompted WWF-Singapore to conduct a feasibility study in 2021 before launching the reusable e-commerce packaging pilot last year.

The pilot ran from April to September 2022 with 12 retailers here such as footwear retailers, book sellers, second-hand clothing sellers and bulk food sellers involved in a programme to test the reusable packaging concept.

In the pilot, customers who opted for reusable packaging for their order were invited to drop off the reusable packaging at any SingPost post box at their convenience after they had received their order.

The overall opt-in rate for reusable packaging of one in three customers varied across the retailers from just 6 per cent to 62 per cent.

The clarity of communication was given as a likely reason for this variation.

Retailers with a higher uptake of opt-ins attributed this to their own marketing and education efforts on reusable packaging on their websites and social media, as well as the ease of opting-in at the point of checkout.

Of those who did not opt-in, 58 per cent of customers surveyed said that they were not fully aware of the concept and option, while 27 per cent thought that the return process was a hassle.

Of the customers who opted in, only about one in two returned the packaging.

On average, it took customers at least 16 days to return the packaging, with the fastest being an immediate return and the slowest taking more than three months.

To help with this problem, some retailers included reminders when they mailed out an order, which helped cut the average time taken for the packaging to be returned by five days.

The findings also showed that there was a handful of customers who reported that returning the reusable packaging was not a priority and that they wanted to keep the packaging for their personal reuse.

WWF-Singapore said that efforts are needed to boost the return rate from about one in two in the pilot to 75 to 83 per cent — at which point the economics of reusable packaging are more compelling.

That equates to reusing the packaging at least four to six times.

Operationally feasible for retailers

WWF-Singapore said that the reusable packing option will help retailers reduce the use of paper boxes and poly mailers and save more in the long run since one item of reusable packaging can be used at least 10 to 20 times.

Retailers are also required to make only minimal information technology changes, which can be easily updated with the opt-in function and a link to a frequently asked questions page with instructions on the packaging return process.

About 90 per cent of retailers in the programme also found that their efficiency had improved, because the simple sealing format on the reusable packaging helped reduce the overall packing time.

Some retailers also identified the potential for cost savings with the cost for each use of an item of reusable packaging averaging below S$2, based on an average return rate of 50 to 83 per cent.

This compares to the current upfront price of S$3 for reusable packaging and a normal parcel return via SingPost at S$1.50.

With implementation on a larger scale, reusable packaging may be supplied at even lower costs, which could mean that the cost for each use of reusable packaging falling below S$1, WWF-Singapore said.

Reusable packaging in Singapore

WWF-Singapore recommends making reusable packaging “the norm” for online buyers in Singapore.

It said that this can be done through:

* Communicating and educating customers on how reusable packaging works, with clear, localised instructions on how to return it after use

* Creating various packaging sizes to facilitate more fulfilment of opt-in order, since the pilot programme only offered off-the-shelf packaging

* Optimising return logistics by expanding more drop-off points, preferably locations that are part of a customer’s daily route so that they can drop off the packaging “on the way” to their next location

* Having a deposit system where customers pay a minimum deposit that will be refunded upon the packaging return

* Charging a maximum fee of 50 cents for the reusable packaging option — TODAY","In all, 15,000 customer transactions were processed during the pilot, with one in three of them choosing reusable packaging.

Six years later, she cried when he visited her in hospital on her birthday, gifting her his hard-earned prize — a trophy for being first among special stackers at this year’s World Sport Stacking Championship.

Not only was it the first time he was competing in an in-person international competition, it was the first time Tan, who is now 21 years old, is competing without his mother by his side since she had been hospitalised on the second day of the competition.

Tan is on the autism spectrum and was one of nine special needs persons competing at the World Sport Stacking Championship 2023 from April 7 to 9 at the Singapore University of Technology and Design.

His mother, 56-year-old homemaker Rosyniah Wang, said: “I was unwell and could not make it for the competition. I was quite worried that he would be affected because children with autism often dislike sudden change.” She was hospitalised last-minute due to heart palpitations.

“So the fact that he put in his best, was independent enough to go to the competition without me and told me he would win me a medal — I am so proud of him,” she added.

There were 368 competitors from around the world for the annual championship, including teams from Australia and Malaysia

Of these, 24 competitors were “special stackers” — a term used to refer to athletes with special needs. This was the first time that more than two special stackers from Singapore were taking part.

Sport stacking, also known as cup stacking, involves participants stacking and downstacking plastic cups in a certain formation as quickly as possible.

Parents interviewed by TODAY gushed about their children’s performances at the tournament, adding that the sport has benefited their children’s focus, hand-eye coordination and social lives.

How special needs youth got involved

It could be said that the community of special stackers in Singapore gathered and formed after Tan asked his mother in early 2021 to buy a new set of cups recognised by the World Sport Stacking Association (WSSA), the sport’s governing international body.

“He had just been using the cheaper cups I had bought and practising stacking through YouTube videos,” Wang recounted.

“I knew he was passionate (about sport stacking), so I searched online and found coach Allan.” Allan Ong is the director of sport stacking equipment supplier Smartway and an ambassador of WSSA Singapore.

It was with his help that Wang pulled together a group of special needs persons to become special stackers.

“After I bought the cups, I spoke to Allan and asked if he could also train Noah as part of his classes even though he had special needs. That was when I realised that there were special stackers competing in the sport overseas,” she said.

And after Ong said he was willing to have more special stackers join the training, Wang invited her son’s friends and their mothers to try out the sport in end-2021. Now, there are more than 10 special stackers training under Ong.

One of them is Muhammad Hakim, 24, a canteen stall assistant who clinched first prize in the special stackers L2 bracket — which is meant for special stackers who are slower in speed.

Hakim has global developmental delay and struggles with his motor skills — but his mother has seen improvement in that area as he stacks the light-weight plastic cup for hours.

His mother, 50-year-old homemaker Rosmawati Rusli, said that if he is not stacking, he is probably watching YouTube videos of other people doing it.

Beyond that, the sport has also taught special stackers such as Hakim teamwork.

“He participated in the doubles and had to work closely with another special stacker. At first, he would get frustrated if his team member didn’t stack properly, but now he can control himself and they will even give each other a high-five as long as they manage to complete (their routine),” Rusli said.

Another stacker is 31-year-old Siau Ek Jin, who placed second after Hakim. Born with a learning difficulty and low IQ, he has difficulties with coordination and communication.

However, through therapy and engaging in various sports such as stacking, Siau’s motor skills have improved.

Lucy Siau, 62, a homemaker, said of her son: “He loves the speed, although he may not be the fastest stacker.

“He used to finish his set at around 40 seconds when he first started. Now, his timing is around six to seven seconds.”

Being able to make new friends through the sport is another benefit. After training at his designated sport stacking corner at home, he usually video-calls his friends to spend time with them before bed.

“Ek Jin and his friends will often keep each other company over these calls, which is good for them to socialise. Sometimes, they will listen if they are not so verbal, or they’ll just video-call and do their own thing,” Siau said.

Supporting each other as a group

Aaron Yap, 26, dislikes sports, but his mother believes that he loves sport stacking because he has artistic leanings.

A visual artist who works part-time at fast-food chain McDonald’s, he is on the autism spectrum and loves the colourful cups. He exclusively uses just one set designed with flames like fire and the cups are coloured brown and yellow.

When Yap’s cups were not qualified for the competition due to wear and tear, he was devastated and his mother had to buy him a new set of cups on the day itself.

Yet, with just three months of practice under his belt and despite the setback of having to use a new set of cups, Yap came in third overall among the special stackers.

His mother, Diana Yap, 56, an instructional assistant in a school, was proud of his win.

“We went to get fish and chips at the hawker centre to celebrate because it’s his favourite, though we always celebrate whether he wins or loses.”

Yap was not watching her son’s win during the competition. Along with the other mothers of special stackers, she was preoccupied being volunteers at the competition.

“I was an emcee to help facilitate the event, while some mothers were handling (the food), helping care for the special stackers and logistics,” she recalled.

These volunteers told TODAY that this was their way of repaying the opportunities given to their children that allowed them to shine.

“When it comes to special needs children, every child is your own kid,” Rusli said.

“Sometimes we have to be firm to ensure that they follow the rules (due to time constraints). Then after the competition, we explain why.”

With all the parents cheering for each other’s children, they said that the community had the “kampung spirit”.

It is for this reason that Tan was able to head to the competition and compete with little hiccup while she was hospitalised, Wang said.

“One of the mummies picked up Noah and took him to the competition. The mummies were all there helping him out when I couldn’t,” she added.

“We’re blessed. It takes a whole village to raise a special needs child, and the whole village came to support (us) when I was in hospital.

“I’m so thankful and grateful for them.”

Growing the sport

Ong, WSSA Singapore’s ambassador, said that the sport has grown since 2013 when he first started teaching the sport in schools and community centres here.

From just three schools, Ong and his team now coach at 25 schools, with some schools teaching the sport independently.

“In the past, when you tell people about stacking, they would be confused. But after more television programmes, like Minute to Win It, more people know (about sport stacking),” he added.

Minute to Win It is an international game show franchise where participants complete a series of one-minute challenges. It was first aired in the United States in 2010. A Singapore spin-off was created in 2014.

To grow the sport here, Ong holds online training sessions every Sunday afternoon over video-conferencing platform Zoom and holds physical training sessions if he is able to book a space at the Sports Hub Library in Kallang.

Having seen the successful turnout at the World Sport Stacking Championship that he and his team of 34 crew members and 70 volunteers organised, Ong is determined to encourage more people to pick up sport stacking, regardless of their background.

The parents of special stackers were also motivated by their children’s success at the championships.

Siau, for instance, is looking to improve her own cup-stacking skills so that she can qualify for the finals with her son during the parent-child match.

As for Wang, she hopes that her son could further his skills so that he, too, may bolster his community by becoming a sport stacking coach for future special stackers.

“He can relate to them better, and also give back by teaching other special needs students a sport that benefited him,” she said. — TODAY","Sport stacking, also known as cup stacking, involves participants stacking and downstacking plastic cups in a certain formation as quickly as possible.

Ewing's mother Helen, a champion surfer in the 1970s and 80s, won the longest running event in competitive surfing in 1983.

Forty years on, 24-year-old Queenslander Ewing dominated an all-Australian final against Newcastle surfer Ryan Callinan in choppy conditions to savour an emotional triumph.

""Far out. It's crazy. This has been a crazy week,"" said Ewing, whose mother died of cancer when he was six.

""It's such a special thing, I’ve been thinking about her since I have been on the tour and it’s been a huge goal of mine. I want to do her proud.""

His name will be etched on the World Surf League (WSL) event's trophy next to his mum's.

Both the finalists pulled off upsets on the way to the decider, with Ewing knocking out Brazilian three-times WSL champion Gabriel Medina in the last 16 and Callinan taking down Hawaiian John John Florence in the semi-finals.

The host nation was also guaranteed a winner in the women's event as reigning champion Tyler Wright claimed the final against compatriot Molly Picklum, the pair having emerged from all-Australian semi-finals.

Twice world champion Wright's Olympian brother Owen, who announced his retirement last month, bowed out of pro surfing at the event with a first round defeat to Ewing.

""I didn't really think much of this week,"" said 29-year-old Tyler after coolly defending her title.

The basketball great wore the “Bred” Air Jordan 13s during Game 2 of the 1998 NBA Finals on the way to his sixth and last NBA championship title.

The online sale cements Jordan’s position as the most valuable athlete at auctions for sportswear memorabilia.

It broke his own record of US$1.5 million for sneakers, set in September 2021.

In 2022, one of his jerseys sold for US$10.1 million (S$13.5 million), the most-ever paid at auction for any game-worn collectibles.

The sale of that jersey from Game 1 of the 1998 NBA Finals eclipsed the US$9.3 million paid for Diego Maradona’s 1986 “Hand of God” Argentina football jersey.

“Today’s result further proves that the demand for Michael Jordan sports memorabilia continues to outperform and transcend all expectations,” said Brahm Wachter, Sotheby’s head of streetwear and modern collectables.

Jordan wore the sneakers for the second half of the Chicago Bulls’ 93-88 victory over Utah Jazz on June 5, 1998.

He scored a game-high 37 points as his Bulls side tied the series 1-1.

The Finals featured in the hit 2020 ESPN/Netflix documentary The Last Dance, about Jordan’s final season with the Chicago side.

Wachter added that nostalgia for a different era was driving the popularity of Jordan memorabilia.

“We have clients in all different areas, from real estate to finance to private equity. There are many people that are interested in this emerging market,” he said.

The US is the right place for the firm’s expansion plans, according to Enterprise Singapore (ESG). The government agency has been linking medical firms up with potential partners and providing grants to help them scale up in the US market.

Mr Clarence Hoe, executive director for Americas and Europe at ESG, said that the US has several research institutions and a vibrant start-up community that offers some of the “top frontier technologies” and commercialises them.

“Singapore companies can see the US as a source of technology and innovation to partner them for these capabilities and look at how we can fine tune their value proposition and expand either in the US or in other parts of the world,” he said.

The US is also seen as a source of top talent in the field, a big part of what drew Singapore-based biomedical firm Engine Biosciences to San Francisco five years ago.

The company develops drugs for cancer patients, and said the biologists and chemists in the US have more experience in the field than those back home.

""The US generally is the most innovative in terms of the biopharma space. It's also one of the largest markets in terms of revenue,” said the firm’s chief business officer Peter Ho.

He added that many of the large biotech companies and biopharma companies are located in the US, creating a “really good ecosystem in terms of innovation, talent, as well as capital"".

The industry is seeing increasing investments after a lull due to the pandemic. The US medical devices market is projected to grow to more than US$255 billion (S$339 billion) by the end of the decade.

Another sector that Singapore companies are trying to break into is the US educational tech industry.

Edutech companies globally have enjoyed investments of nearly US$48 billion (S$64 billion) since the pandemic struck in 2020, more than the sector received in funding over the previous decade.

Mohd Nazlan is the judge who heard Najib’s SRC International Sdn Bhd case.

In a joint statement, the two non-governmental organisations said the campaign appears to have been designed to subvert the administration of justice and to bring the Malaysian judiciary into disrepute.

“Bersih and GBM believe the smear campaign that has been launched against Justice Nazlan and the Malaysian judicial system by his (Najib’s) lawyers and associates is intended to secure and justify for Najib a royal pardon that would see him freed from prison.

“We humbly call on His Majesty the Yang di-Pertuan Agong and all Malaysians to reject this attempt by a convicted criminal and his associates to subvert the administration of justice and to bring the judiciary into disrepute,” the statement read.

Bersih and GBM also called for the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) to undergo structural reform for its heinous action against the Malaysian judicial system.

Commenting on MACC’s investigations against Mohd Nazlan, the NGOs said the graft busters had announced to the press in April 2022 about ongoing investigations against a judge for corruption offences, following allegations made against Mohd Nazlan by a blogger.

They said MACC had overstepped its authority when it concluded that Mohd Nazlan violated the Judges’ Code of Ethics 2009.

“MACC has no expertise or authority to decide whether a judge presiding over a criminal trial has a conflict of interest that requires him to recuse himself from the trial or to decide whether the judge has breached the code of ethics.

“It is clear from this episode that the MACC needs deep structural reforms to free it from the influence of the Executive and not be weaponised for political expediency,” said the pressure groups.

They added that MACC has no right to make any findings nor come to a view or decide on matters that fall outside their jurisdiction because of a protocol set out by the Federal Court on February 24 for handling investigations against members of the judiciary.

“The investigating body should first seek leave from the Chief Justice to investigate any judge.

“The facts or contents of the investigation cannot be publicised or advertised without the prior approval of the Chief Justice.

“The entire contents of the investigation must always remain confidential, and the Public Prosecutor must consult the Chief Justice when giving instructions during investigations and in respect of his decision to prosecute,” they said.

Bersih and GBM called for an inquiry into the MACC’s actions and the curious timing of publicising their investigation just before Najib’s SRC final appeal before the apex court last year.

The Shiveluch volcano erupted just after midnight, reaching a crescendo about six hours later, spewing out an ash cloud over an area of 108,000 sq km, according to the Kamchatka Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences’ Geophysical Survey.

Lava flows tumbled from the volcano, melting snow and prompting a warning of mud flows along a nearby highway, while villages were carpeted in drifts of grey ash as deep as 8.5cm, the deepest in 60 years.

“The ash reached 20km high, the ash cloud moved westwards and there was a very strong fall of ash on nearby villages,” said Dr Danila Chebrov, director of the Kamchatka branch of the Geophysical Survey.

“The volcano was preparing for this for at least a year... and the process is continuing, though it has calmed a little now,” Dr Chebrov said.

He said the volcano would probably calm now, but that further major ash clouds could not be excluded. He said lava flows should not reach local villages.

The Kamchatka Volcanic Eruption Response Team (KVERT) issued a red notice for aviation, saying “ongoing activity could affect international and low-flying aircraft”.

Some schools in the Kamchatka peninsula, about 6,800km east of Moscow, were closed and residents ordered to stay indoors, head of the Ust-Kamchatsky municipal region Oleg Bondarenko said in a Telegram post.

“Because what I have just seen here with my own eyes, it will be impossible for children to go to school, and in general, the presence of children here is questionable,” Mr Bondarenko said.

He said residents power had been restored and that drinking water was being supplied.

One of Kamchatka’s largest and most active volcanoes, Shiveluch has had an estimated 60 substantial eruptions in the past 10,000 years, the last major one being in 2007.

It has two main parts, the smaller of which – Young Shiveluch – scientists have reported as being extremely active in recent months, with a peak of 2,800m that protrudes out of the 3,283m-high Old Shiveluch.

Scientists posted pictures of the ash cloud billowing swiftly over the forests and rivers of the far east and of villages covered in ash.

https://www.malaymail.com/news/world/2023/04/12/doctors-in-england-start-historic-four-day-strike-over-pay/64365,Doctors in England start historic four-day strike over pay,"LONDON, April 12 — Doctors working in England’s public health service yesterday launched what has been billed as the most disruptive strike in its history, in a dispute over pay and working conditions.

The four-day walkout, which began at 7am, follows months of strikes by other public and private sector staff as inflation sparks the UK’s worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation.

The action by so-called junior doctors — physicians who are not senior specialists but who may still years of experience — comes after a three-day stoppage last month and several strikes by nurses.

It threatens to be the most serious walkout yet and lead to the cancellation of hundreds of thousands of appointments.

They are demanding a pay rise of 35 per cent, which they say is needed to help make up for more than a decade of salary cuts in real terms.

They also argue pandemic backlogs coupled with staff shortages are massively increasing workloads, endangering patients.

“We have had a massive pay cut and we are filling more gaps because people are leaving,” said junior doctor Katrina Forsyth, who added she sometimes wept after shifts.

“It’s becoming less safe for patients,” she said from a picket line after finishing a night shift at St. Thomas’ Hospital in London.

The government maintains the BMA’s request is unaffordable, as ministers try to dampen wage demands across the public sector amid stagnant growth and high inflation.

After slowing for three straight months, the Consumer Prices Index shot up to 10.4 per cent in February — close to 40-year highs and more than five times the target set by the Bank of England.

“I hoped to begin formal pay negotiations with the BMA last month but its demand for a 35 per cent pay rise is unreasonable,” said Health Secretary Steve Barclay.

“If the BMA is willing to move significantly from this position and cancel strikes we can resume confidential talks and find a way forward, as we have done with other unions.”

‘Immense pressures’

Barclay struck a deal last month with unions representing various health workers, including nurses, to increase pay by five percent.

Union members are currently voting on whether to accept it.

However, the deal does not cover junior doctors, who comprise around half of all NHS doctors, according to official figures.

Their latest walkout will pile “immense pressures” on the service, NHS England medical director Stephen Powis warned.

“This is a significant set of industrial action that’s going to cause major disruption,” he told BBC radio.

The strike affects the NHS in England but not in the UK’s other regions.

Up to a quarter of a million appointments could be postponed, according to the NHS Confederation, which represents the system in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

Family doctors are also reported by British media to be closed for appointments for up to a week, as GPs are drafted in to provide cover.

Powis said the NHS is “working very hard” to ensure emergency services are staffed but that cover was “fragile” and “routine care will be affected”.

Phil Sutcliffe, 75, of south London, was among those affected, with his cancer check-up appointment postponed to next month.

But he joined the St Thomas’ Hospital picket line, organised by the British Medical Association (BMA).

“These doctors do the most fantastic job for very modest pay... so the government needs to get to the negotiating table and start talking,” he said. — AFP","LONDON, April 12 — Doctors working in England’s public health service yesterday launched what has been billed as the most disruptive strike in its history, in a dispute over pay and working conditions.

Manohar Thirunavukkarasu, 25, is also accused of six other offences, including harassment and criminal trespass.

The Singaporean was at the Lee Kong Chian School of Business at Singapore Management University in Stamford Road at around 2.30am on Tuesday when he allegedly assaulted two people.

He is accused of punching and kicking one of them and slapping the other.

Court documents did not disclose if the pair had any ties to the university.

Manohar, who was said to have had an axe in his possession that morning, is also accused of kicking a public servant’s left leg and abusing the man with vulgar language.

Details about the officer’s agency were not disclosed in court documents.

In a video posted on YouTube, an axe-wielding man is seen crossing the road towards Raffles City Shopping Centre.

He walks towards a police car parked at a nearby traffic light, and two uniformed officers point their weapons at him.

What types of weapons the officers are holding cannot be discerned from the footage.

The man then throws his axe, which lands on an adjacent pavement.

In an earlier statement, the police said they were alerted to a fight in Stamford Road at about 2.30am on Tuesday.

They added: “A 25-year-old man was subsequently arrested for possession of (an) offensive weapon, using criminal force to deter a public servant from the discharge of his duty, and using abusive language against a public servant.”

The police also said a 71-year-old man was taken to hospital conscious, while a 29-year-old man is assisting with investigations.

It is not known if the fight occurred before or after the video was taken.

Separately, Manohar is accused of trespassing into Sophia Residence condominium in Sophia Road near Selegie Road on or around Feb 26.

On March 4, he allegedly committed other offences, including sending an image of his genitals to another person.

Manohar will be remanded at the Institute of Mental Health for medical examination, and his case has been adjourned to April 26.

If convicted of being in possession of a weapon in a public place, he can be jailed for up to three years and receive at least six strokes of the cane.

For each count of assault, an offender can be jailed for up to three years and fined up to $5,000.","SINGAPORE – A man who allegedly wielded an axe in Stamford Road on Tuesday morning was charged with two counts of assault on Wednesday.

Noel Hunt, manager of the under-21 side, will take over for the remaining five games of the season, the club said in a statement.

Former England, Manchester United and Liverpool midfielder Ince was appointed on an interim basis last February when the Royals were also in danger of the drop, and he was then made permanent manager in May.

Reading are without a win from their last eight matches and fell into the relegation zone after losing 2-1 at Preston North End on Monday. They were handed a six-point deduction last week for failing to comply with budget restrictions.

They were first handed a six-point deduction in 2021 after admitting to exceeding profit and sustainability limits, with a further six-point penalty to be applied if an agreed business plan was not fulfilled.

The EFL said last week that Reading had ""admitted to the two breaches"" of that business plan following a review by an independent panel.

Reading's next match is at home to Championship leaders Burnley, who have already secured promotion to the Premier League next season.","LONDON (Reuters - Reading sacked Paul Ince as manager on Tuesday with the club 22nd in the Championship and in danger of relegation to the third tier of English soccer after being docked six points last week.

https://www.straitstimes.com/life/at-the-movies-lost-love-riceboy-sleeps-are-heartfelt-maternal-dramas,"At The Movies: Lost Love, Riceboy Sleeps are heartfelt maternal dramas","Lost Love (PG)

92 minutes, opens on Thursday

4 stars

The story: Sammi Cheng was named Best Actress by the Hong Kong Film Critics Society and is the favourite heading into the Hong Kong Film Awards on Sunday for her performance as grieving Mei, who turns to fostering children after the death of her son. There will be joy, but also further heartbreak.

Debut director Ka Sing Fung, a former journalist, provides a rare look inside Hong Kong’s foster care system. The poignant maternal drama Lost Love is a perfection of social realism and boundless compassion.

Fostering means much more than supplementary income for Mei and her husband (Alan Luk), who works odd jobs. She gets to be a mother again, and she certainly deserves sympathy in her efforts to reconcile her selfish needs with those of her wards.

Cheng, with tremendous subtlety, plays out the competing emotions on her character’s weary face. The Cantopop diva is wan and plain, almost beyond recognition. Equally touching is Luk in the role of her loving spouse. “Why don’t we raise a dog?” he proposes as their marriage comes undone from her single-minded dedication to parenting.

Even the children leave an impression, all seven of them over the years – including a traumatised boy, a sweet girl with a cleft lip and two obstreperous preteen siblings with a dad in prison.

The episodic narrative is structured around each arrival in the couple’s working-class New Territories home. All eventually leave, either returned to their families or adopted by another, hence continuing Mei’s cycle of loss along her bittersweet journey of loving and letting go.

Hot take: The best Hong Kong production of the year so far, and there may not be another this affecting.

Introduced early this year, the Money Packet feature was an interesting way to distribute Ang Pows as receivers can get randomised amounts from a fixed pool. Following some feedback during the last holiday season, TNG eWallet has finally added a new “Equal” amounts option.

To send a Money Packet, just launch the Touch ‘n Go eWallet app and then tap on “Transfer” on the home page. Then, tap on “Money Packet” tab at the top and then tap on Create Money Packet.

From here, you can choose Random or Equal. The Random option will let you set the total pool amount and the number of recipients, and the system will automatically randomise the Money Packet distribution. This means someone might receive a very large amount while the unlucky few might get a very small amount.

To ensure that everyone gets a fair share, the new Equal option will distribute the Money Packets in equal amounts. Just enter the number of receivers, each packet amount and a personalised message. After creating the packet, you can send a link that’s sharable through instant messaging apps or show a QR code for your visitors to scan. Recipients must have an updated TNG eWallet app to receive the money.

Take note that each Money Packet is valid for only 24 hours and you have the ability to cancel it at any time.

https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/malaysia-lists-sulu-heir-as-a-terrorist-in-claim-over-sabah,Malaysia lists Sulu heir as a terrorist in claim over Sabah,"KUALA LUMPUR – Malaysia has classified one of the self-styled descendants of the sultanate of Sulu as a terrorist, as part of measures to safeguard national sovereignty amid a territorial dispute between the two parties.

The Home Ministry gazetted Muhammad Fuad Abdullah Kiram as a terrorist under the country’s anti-money laundering and terrorism laws, Mr Khairul Dzaimee Daud, director-general in the Law Ministry, told reporters on Tuesday.

Fuad is one of the Sulu group’s eight members claiming to be the heirs of the Sulu sultan, Mr Khairul said.

According to a federal gazette dated April 6, Fuad A. Kiram is listed as a 69-year-old Filipino who had previously participated in and facilitated the commission of a terrorist act.

Fuad had been part of the Royal Sulu Force, which Malaysia’s government considers a terrorist group.

The claimants secured a RM62.59 billion (S$18.9 billion) award against Malaysia in 2022 over their territorial claims to the state of Sabah.

In March, a court in Paris dismissed a bid by the Sulu group to enforce the award by upholding Malaysia’s stay on the enforcement of the order.

The approach now “is to go on the offensive” against the Sulu heirs’ claim, a change from the previous approach of “firefighting”, Mr Khairul said.

Malaysia’s Home Minister Saifuddin Nasution Ismail would also visit the four countries – France, Spain, Luxembourg and the Netherlands – involved in the arbitration of the case, he said.

The Sulu Sultanate leased Sabah state to a British company in 1878 and it was later absorbed into Malaysia.

https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/facing-criminal-charges-trump-vows-to-never-drop-us-presidential-bid,"Facing criminal charges, Trump vows to ‘never’ drop US presidential bid","WASHINGTON - Former US president Donald Trump, having been criminally charged in New York, pledged on Tuesday to “never drop out” of the 2024 race for the White House, and insisted President Joe Biden is not fit to run again.

The Republican real estate magnate, who is facing 34 felony counts in New York over alleged hush money paid to an adult film actress, told Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson that nothing would prevent him from running – even a conviction.

“I’d never drop out,” he said.

“It’s not my thing. I wouldn’t do it,” he added.

Trump, 76, in his first major interview since being arrested and fingerprinted last week, cast doubt on whether Democrat Biden, 80, would be in the 2024 race.

“I don’t see how it’s possible,” he said.

“It’s not an age thing… I don’t think he can. I just don’t see Biden doing it from a physical or a mental standpoint. I don’t see it.”

Trump and other senior Republicans have repeatedly cast doubt on Mr Biden’s mental acuity and apparent frailty.

Right-wing outlets like Fox News frequently highlight his verbal flubs and moments where he appears to have lost his train of thought.

Throughout Trump’s own presidency, Fox News offered an uncritical forum for him to air his grievances, with the then commander-in-chief sometimes calling in unannounced to shows and talking at length to presenters.

The relationship cooled after Trump’s defeat to Mr Biden at the ballot box in 2020, but has steadily grown again as the Republican nominating contest heats up.

The interview, part two of which is expected to be broadcast on Wednesday, comes weeks after texts emerged showing Mr Carlson speaking disparagingly about Trump after his election loss.

The messages were uncovered as part of a US$1.6 billion (S$2.13 billion) lawsuit brought by Dominion Voting Systems against the Mr Rupert Murdoch-run news organisation over its coverage of Trump and his allies’ unfounded claims of widespread fraud in the 2020 election.

“We are very, very close to being able to ignore Trump most nights. I truly can’t wait,” says one text message sent by Mr Carlson two days before a Trump-supporting mob, inspired by the then President’s false claims of a “stolen election”, invaded the US Capitol in Washington.

“I hate him passionately,” says another.

The Emmy-winning comedy-drama continues the story of Midge Maisel (Rachel Brosnahan), whose picture-perfect life in 1950s New York City is upended when she decides to pursue an improbable dream: becoming a stand-up comic.

The acclaimed series has been a career high for Brosnahan, winning her the Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actress in 2018. That year, the show also took home trophies for Outstanding Comedy Series and Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series.

But the 32-year-old American actress remembers how terrified she was initially about taking on the role, her first in a comedy.

This was especially while shooting Season 1, when Midge discovers her hidden comedic talents – something Brosnahan was not sure she could convincingly portray.

“I was massively intimidated by this role, by this set, by this brilliant writing and all the brilliant comedic talent I was surrounded by, having never done comedy at all before this show,” says Brosnahan, whose breakout TV role was a three-season stint in political thriller series House Of Cards (2013 to 2018).

“When we first started shooting the stand-up, I just remember getting up there and feeling so anxious, like I just wanted to sink into a hole in the floor,” she adds during a virtual panel.

But co-star Alex Borstein, the 52-year-old American actress and stand-up comedian who plays Midge’s manager Susie Myerson, came to her rescue.

Borstein – whose performance won her two Emmys for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series – “has saved my a** and pushed me and lifted me up more times than I can count over five seasons of shooting”, says Brosnahan.

She looked to Borstein during one of the first sets where Midge is supposed to be winning over a crowd with her jokes, and said: “Just please tell me if this is terrible. If you have any advice (on doing stand-up), please pull me aside and just help.”","The acclaimed series has been a career high for Brosnahan, winning her the Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actress in 2018.

""I believe we will regain balance, but tomorrow starts another challenge, 180 minutes long,"" Pioli told a news conference on Tuesday ahead of the game at San Siro.

Runaway leaders Napoli are 16 points clear in Serie A, having only dropped points five times in 29 league games this season, and have enjoyed a stellar Champions League campaign.

""(Napoli are) a team of the highest calibre, the team that have scored the most goals in the Champions League, and won the most games after Bayern,"" Pioli said.

""They have great quality but we start from 0-0 and I expect two balanced matches. We can expect something different from them, which can also be a new attitude in the defensive phase, and we have to be good at recognising that.

""The league performances have given us some indication. We know we have to play a great game to be up to the task against such a strong team. (But) regardless of (league) performances, all that matters now is the Milan that takes the field tomorrow.

""We must play a focused game in every aspect. The opponents have great quality and they know how to take advantage of every mistake and be dangerous. We cannot afford to drop our concentration levels because the stakes are very high.""

Napoli will be without forward Victor Osimhen, who has been left out of manager Luciano Spalletti's squad due to injury.

But Milan defender Theo Hernandez insisted the absence of Serie A's top scorer would not change his side's approach.

""Nothing changes for us,"" he said. ""In Napoli everyone is strong, it's a team of great players and whoever replaces him will do well.""

The Florida-based company said on Friday that it had engaged with financial advisers to help improve its capital structure and near-term liquidity, while also reviewing its real-estate portfolio in a bid to preserve its liquidity.

Shares of the company slumped as much as 50 per cent to a near three-year low of US$1.21 on Monday, and ended the session down 48 per cent with a market value of about US$55 million.

The stock was trading up at US$1.32 on Tuesday, still shy from its 2021 high of US$38.57, when the company benefited from a surge in demand as the lockdown-induced home cooking prompted consumers to use Tupperware containers to store their leftovers.

Still, Tupperware saw a decline in sales volumes since 2022 as consumers maintained a cautious stance with their discretionary spending.

Tupperware, known for its airtight, durable and colourful storage containers and bowls, had to hike prices to protect its margins from higher interest rates and elevated costs of resin and labour, as well as a stronger US dollar and lingering supply chain challenges.

The company in November had raised doubts about its ability as a going concern, citing that it was doubtful about whether it could comply with some of its debt covenants.

Founded in 1946 by chemist Earl Tupper, the company became popular for the way it sold its products - through representatives selling door-to-door - much like cosmetics company Avon.

https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/quest-for-najib-s-pardon-and-court-move-by-zahid-raise-questions-about-pm-anwar-s-leadership,Quest for Najib’s pardon and court move by Zahid raise questions about PM Anwar’s leadership,"KUALA LUMPUR - Umno’s move to ask the Malaysian King to consider a royal pardon for former premier Najib Razak has raised questions about Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim’s stance in handling political manoeuvres by his political ally.

The controversy over the pardon request was followed quickly by another hot potato.

This involved Umno president Zahid Hamidi, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, getting his High Court trial postponed on Monday by four months after he asked the Attorney-General’s Chambers to drop 47 graft charges against him based on “new facts and evidence”.

The Umno-led Barisan Nasional (BN) is a crucial ally in Datuk Seri Anwar’s unity government, with 30 seats in Parliament. Malaysia’s five-month old government led by Mr Anwar’s Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition is likely to collapse should BN withdraw its support.

Najib has served eight months of a 12-year jail term for graft after exhausting his legal appeals against conviction in a case linked to state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB).

PM Anwar has said that he will be a member of the Pardons Board panel that will decide on Umno’s request. The recommendations of the panel would be passed on to the King for his consideration.

But Mr Anwar said the decision to grant a pardon to Najib would be up to Malaysia’s titular head of state, Sultan Abdullah Ahmad Shah, and not the board.

“I will be part of the process, and on the matters of the awarding of honorific titles and pardons, that is the prerogative of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong (the King),” Mr Anwar said on Saturday.

Johor MP Hassan Abdul Karim, who is from Mr Anwar’s Parti Keadilan Rakyat (PKR), on Tuesday said the government’s good image has been shaken by the Najib and Zahid moves. He warned that voters will reject PH should even one of the appeals be approved.

“The political coalition of PH and Parti Keadilan Rakyat will be rejected by the people in the next six state elections,” Mr Hassan said. “Following that, PH and PKR will be rejected by the people in the next general election. He was referring to state polls in six states that must be held by August this year.

Asian Studies Professor James Chin from the University of Tasmania commented wryly: “Hari Raya is coming up and it’s the time people ask for forgiveness. But the funny thing is, it’s difficult to ask for forgiveness because Najib has always said he’s not involved.”

Amid tensions raised by the request for Najib’s pardon, a senior member of Mr Anwar’s PH coalition has made clear that it is Umno, and not the PH-led government, that is making the amnesty appeal.

“The Cabinet never discussed this (pardon) and Cabinet ministers from Umno had not raised the issue,” said Transport Minister Anthony Loke, secretary-general of the Democratic Action Party which has the most number of seats in Parliament among the three PH parties.

“The issue of a pardon is not the government’s stand but that of Umno as a political party,” he said on Tuesday, when asked by reporters.

This followed remarks last week by Umno secretary-general Asyraf Wajdi Dusuki that its leadership council had unanimously agreed to seek an audience with Sultan Abdullah to present a memorandum urging him to pardon Najib.","The controversy over the pardon request was followed quickly by another hot potato.

“We take this very seriously,” Mr Austin told reporters at a briefing on Tuesday.

“And we will continue to investigate, and turn over every rock, until we find the source of this and the extent of it.”

Mr Austin said he was first briefed on April 6 about what he called “reports of unauthorised disclosure of sensitive and classified material” compiled by the Defence Department.

In the days since, the Justice Department has opened an investigation and the US has sought to reassure allies about its ability to keep secrets safe.

Mr Austin had no answer when pressed on why the documents were on the Web for more than a month before US officials discovered them, repeating that the leak is still under investigation.

The secret documents, which appeared on social media sites in recent weeks, reveal information on a range of topics, from US assessments of the war in Ukraine to intelligence gathered on diplomatic allies.

Their disclosure raised new questions about the government’s ability to keep its secrets from entering the public realm following a series of far more voluminous leaks by Chelsea Manning in 2010 and Edward Snowden in 2013.

“I can’t say much more while the Justice Department’s investigation is ongoing, but we take this very seriously, and we will continue to work closely with our outstanding allies and partners,” Mr Austin said, in a briefing on Tuesday alongside Secretary of State Antony Blinken.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/strawberries-singapore-farm-singrow-bao-shengjie-3400761,Genetics and AI: The tech that goes into growing strawberries in Singapore,"But strawberries are just the testbed for the technology. While Singrow’s small-scale farm supplies to some hotels here and sells its produce online, to ramp up production the agri-tech start-up is providing its plants and tech to larger farms in the region.

On Monday (Apr 11), it signed agreements with two farms – TreeGrow in Malaysia and and PREINO in Thailand – as part of its global expansion plans, and it is also branching out to China.

Singrow will provide the outdoor farms with its crop varieties, starting with strawberries. It will also work with the farms to improve their farming techniques for existing crops, with plans to reduce their fertiliser use by 30 per cent and pesticide use by 70 per cent.

The Singrow Farm at the Science Park, which was officially opened on Monday, will serve as the company's research and development hub.

Besides strawberries, it is also developing 30 other crop varieties, including rice, palm oil, saffron, cherry tomatoes and some types of leafy vegetables.

“The reason we choose all these different crops is, first of all, we see some market pains from current production. And secondly, our technology can be easily adapted to solve these problems for all these given crops.”

For example, 95 per cent of saffron is farmed in one country – Iran – using conventional practices, so the supply and quality are unstable, said Dr Bao.

“In our case, we are able to grow the saffron under a controlled environment,” he said. This has led to a harvest in four months – or about half the time it usually takes.","But strawberries are just the testbed for the technology.

https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/south-korea-to-lend-500000-rounds-of-artillery-shells-to-us-report,"South Korea to lend 500,000 rounds of artillery shells to US: Report","SEOUL - South Korea reached an agreement in March to lend the United States 500,000 rounds of 155mm artillery shells that could give Washington greater flexibility to supply Ukraine with ammunition, a South Korean newspaper reported on Wednesday.

The DongA Ilbo newspaper cited unnamed government sources as saying that South Korea decided to “lend” the ammunition instead of selling in order to minimise the possibility of South Korean shells being used in the Ukraine conflict.

It said the loaned shells would be used primarily by the US to fill its stockpile.

President Yoon Suk-yeol has said a South Korean law that forbids supplying weapons to countries engaged in conflict makes it difficult to send arms to Ukraine.

Having bought 100,000 rounds of shells in 2022, the US government had asked to buy the same amount or more in February, but the South Korean government sought another way to supply the ammunition to its ally.

“We’ve opted to significantly increase the volume of shells, but take the rental method after exploring how to respond to the request of the blood ally in good faith while sticking to the government principle of not providing lethal weapons to Ukraine,” an unnamed source was quoted as saying.

Both Seoul and Washington have previously confirmed that they were negotiating an artillery supply deal, but there has been no official word on whether any agreement was finalised.

The DongA Ilbo said the agreement was reached in March.

South Korea’s Defence Ministry said the allies have been exploring ways to help Ukraine defend its freedom, but declined to confirm specific discussions.

The US State Department did not immediately offer comment.

Foreign Minister Park Jin told reporters that he could not confirm the newspaper report, but said the government position against providing lethal aid for Ukraine remains unchanged.

The report came after leaked highly classified US military documents highlighted South Korea’s difficulties in squaring pressure from Western allies to help with the supply of military aid to Ukraine and its own policy of staying out of the conflict.

Separately, when asked at a parliamentary session on Wednesday if the US confirmed to South Korea that there was no spying on its presidential office, Mr Park declined to comment but said unauthorised wiretapping would be considered “problematic”.

South Korea is a key US ally and major producer of artillery ammunition, but has sought to avoid antagonising Russia in the light of economic ties and Moscow’s influence over North Korea.

Mr Yoon, who is visiting Washington in April for a summit with US President Joe Biden, has said Seoul has not provided any lethal weapons to Ukraine and would expand humanitarian assistance instead.

The country’s assistance to Ukraine was included in classified documents leaked online earlier in 2023 and spotlighted in reports during the past week.

In the documents, top South Korean presidential officials worried about a plan to sell artillery shells to Washington, saying they might be diverted to Ukraine despite Seoul’s argument that the US military should be the “end user”.

One leaked bulletin, marked “Top Secret” and seen by Reuters, said Seoul in early March “grappled with the US request to provide artillery ammunition to Ukraine”.

Former national security adviser Kim Sung-han “suggested the possibility of selling the 330,000 rounds of 155mm munitions to Poland, since getting the ammunition to Ukraine quickly was the ultimate goals of the United States”, it said.

Another leaked document dated Feb 27, marked “Secret” and titled “ROK 155 Delivery Timeline” said 153,600 rounds of 155mm rounds could be delivered to Ukraine in about 41 days by aircraft.

Reuters was unable to independently verify the authenticity of the documents.

US officials have said some documents giving battlefield casualty estimates from Ukraine appeared to have been modified to understate Russian losses.

Seoul and Washington were scrambling to contain the fallout of the leak, saying some documents were altered and untrue.

Mr Kim Tae-hyo, South Korea’s deputy national security adviser, has said Seoul and Washington agreed that a “considerable number” of the released documents were fabricated.

“A third party is involved in many parts of this issue, and there is no evidence that the United States, which is our ally, has done anything to us with ill intentions,” Mr Kim told reporters as he arrived in Washington on Tuesday to discuss Mr Yoon’s upcoming visit.

More than 300,000 former soldiers and ex-conscripts are believed to have been called up since President Vladimir Putin announced an emergency draft last year to support Russia’s “special military operation” in Ukraine.

Currently, conscription papers in Russia have to be delivered in person by the local military enlistment office or via an employer, but the proposed changes to legislation would see conscription papers being sent via recorded mail and online.

Once an electronic summons is received, citizens who fail to show up at the military enlistment office will be automatically banned from travelling abroad.

“The summons is considered received from the moment it is placed in the personal account of a person liable for military service,” Andrei Kartapolov, chairman of the Russian parliament’s defence committee, said in comments on television.

After a chaotic roll-out last year, Russia has moved to streamline its process of drafting soldiers into the army by digitising its military records.

The Kremlin promised to fix what it said were “mistakes” with its mobilisation campaign, after men who were ineligible for the draft because of their age or medical conditions were called up to fight in Ukraine.

The initial announcement to introduce mobilisation prompted thousands of draft age men to flee abroad last year, while protests broke out — and were swiftly suppressed — in multiple Russian cities.

https://www.malaymail.com/news/world/2023/04/11/study-inflation-means-last-call-for-raft-of-uk-pubs/64340,Study: Inflation means last call for raft of UK pubs,"LONDON, April 11 — The number of pub closures in England and Wales surged 47 per cent in the first quarter from a year earlier as inflation soared, a study showed today.

The huge increase came as energy bills rocketed and customers struggled with big price increases for pints of beer, other beverages and food.

Britain’s government also ended huge Covid financial support schemes last year, hitting businesses hard at a time when their own costs began rocketing.

More recently, the government reduced its help for energy bills, making pubs “even more attractive for alternative investment”, according to Alex Probyn, president of property tax at Altus Group, whose survey was based on government data.

Many pubs that close in Britain are turned into houses or apartments.

A total of 153 pubs shut in the first quarter compared with 104 during the first three months of 2022, according to Altus.

UK annual inflation is stuck in double digits, accelerating to 10.4 per cent in February.

A joint study today from the British Retail Consortium and accountants KPMG showed consumers cutting back on purchases of food and drink.

It also showed businesses offsetting this with price hikes.

“UK food and drink sales in March followed a similar pattern as previous months, with volume sales continuing to be negative and value sales positive,” said Susan Barratt, chief executive at retail analysts IGD.

“As such, inflation continues to loom heavily over shoppers.” — AFP","LONDON, April 11 — The number of pub closures in England and Wales surged 47 per cent in the first quarter from a year earlier as inflation soared, a study showed today.

The Belgium striker has struggled with injury and form this season and saw the 37-year-old Edin Dzeko preferred to him to lead Inter’s attack for the first leg of the quarter-final tie at Lisbon’s Estadio da Luz.

But he came off the bench to tuck away an 82nd-minute penalty that ensured Inter’s victory, after Nicolo Barella had headed home in the 51st, and a potentially decisive advantage for next week’s return leg at the San Siro.

“Yes, yes, I understand the reasons (for being on the bench) because of my previous performances but I just have to look ahead and try to help the team as much as possible,” said Lukaku, who has just seven goals in 23 matches in all competitions this season.

“I’m getting back in shape, I’m giving a lot to the team, but everyone else is doing it too.

“We have a responsibility to do well for the club, now we need to do well in the league at the weekend to have the right confidence for the second leg.”

The 29-year-old also said he had focused hard on picking his spot for the penalty kick, cutting out the noise in the cavernous stadium with more than 60,000 fans.

“You need not listen to other players. I don’t listen to anyone, not even my teammates, I’m just focused on the ball and where I want to put it in,” he explained.

“We played an intelligent game. We also had other opportunities to score three or four goals but, against a team like this, a 2-0 win is a good result. Now we have to try to do well in the league too, which is important.”

Inter, who had not won in six matches coming into Tuesday’s tie, next face Monza at home in the Serie A on Saturday before the second leg next Wednesday.

Azlan pled not guilty to all the charges before Judge Azura Alwi.

According to the charge sheet, Azlan is accused of transferring four cheques — RM208,339.90, RM196,651, RM224,404.40 and RM222,811.95 — believed to be proceeds from unlawful activities from Aidil Travel & Tours Sdn Bhd and Sri Kedawang Travel & Tours (W) Sdn Bhd to two bank accounts he owned at a Maybank and CIMB branch in KL and Putrajaya respectively.

He was also accused of receiving RM207,468 in cash believed to be proceeds from unlawful activities from a representative of Aidil Travel & Tours Sdn Bhd at the Sheraton Imperial Hotel Kuala Lumpur.

All the offences were allegedly committed between February 2014 and December 2017.

He was charged under Section 4(1)(b) of the Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act and is liable to be punished under Section 4(1) of the same act.

Section 4(1) provides imprisonment of up to 15 years, a fine of not less than five times the amount or value of the proceeds of the illegal activity or RM5 million, whichever is higher, if found guilty.

His bail was set at RM50,000 and his next court appearance at the Sessions Court here will be on June 9.

Azlan was represented by Burhanudeen Abdul Wahid while deputy public prosecutor Ahmad Akram Gharib prosecuted.

On April 10, Azlan was charged with five counts of submitting false overseas travel claims worth more than RM1.18 million between 2013 and 2017 at the Sessions Court in Kangar, Perlis.

He allegedly used several documents containing false particulars to make claims for overseas holiday in London when there was no such trip.

The documents included invoices and quotations for return air tickets and hotel accommodation issued by Sri Kedawang Travel & Tours (W) Sdn Bhd and Aidil Travel & Tours Sdn Bhd, and Perlis state government order form AM 75E which were allegedly used for making claims for air tickets, hotel accommodation and transport.

Azlan was Pauh Assemblyman and Perlis menteri besar from 2013 to 2022, before winning the Bintong state seat in 2018, which he lost in last November’s election.

https://www.malaymail.com/news/money/2023/04/12/epf-refutes-allegation-of-cash-crunch-crisis-act-amendment/64420,"EPF refutes allegation of cash crunch crisis, Act amendment","KUALA LUMPUR, April 12 ― The Employees Provident Fund (EPF) has refuted speculations of a cash crunch crisis building up in the retirement funds as well as the amendment of EPF Act 1991 to prevent retirees from withdrawing their savings.

In a statement, the retirement savings fund said it has always maintained sufficient liquidity to meet all of its obligations.

It said the sale and purchase of overseas assets are a normal part of the EPF’s investment operations as one of its asset allocation strategies, stressing that the move was not for the payment of premature withdrawals.

“In fact, there has been a slow but steady increase in the EPF’s overall foreign exposure over the years, even during the Covid-19 crisis.

“Additionally, there is no truth to the speculation that the EPF Act 1991 will be amended to prevent retirees from withdrawing their savings,” it said.

The EPF issued the statement to refute the speculations circulating via WhatsApp which referred to an article titled “Bank Negara says Malaysians could run out of savings 19 years too soon” published by an international daily on April 7.

“What Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) has highlighted is the dire situation for retirees, even before the pandemic, due to structural issues such as low wages,” it said.

According to BNM, the median savings for the 51-55 age group would have only lasted five years upon withdrawal at 55, and that has dropped to around three years after the pandemic-related withdrawals.

“The report further states that an average Malaysian would be at risk of depleting their retirement savings 19 years before death, with global life expectancy rising to above 77 years old by 2050,” it said.

Additionally, millennials in the 26-40 age group are likely to face significant financial challenges, as many of them are struggling to meet the EPF’s Basic Savings threshold of RM240,000.

“The special pandemic-related withdrawals have also resulted in significant reductions in the amount of retirement savings for the members involved,” the EPF said.

As of March 2023, 70.5 per cent out of the 7.2 million active formal sector members aged 18-55 years do not meet the EPF’s Basic Savings threshold by age, while 3.1 million or 39 per cent of members who made special withdrawals and are below age 55 years as of January 2023 have not started rebuilding their savings.

As such, their savings levels remain critically low with a median savings of RM890, said EPF.

“Our primary concern in this matter is to prioritise the rebuilding of retirement savings and to extend coverage to those who fall outside the current scope of the EPF Act 1991.

“The EPF and the government are also discussing other areas of reform that may be useful in addressing the currently poor state of retirement adequacy that has been further exposed by the pandemic,” it said.

The retirement fund also advised its members to only trust communications from official sources, and not speculations in social media. ― Bernama","KUALA LUMPUR, April 12 ― The Employees Provident Fund (EPF) has refuted speculations of a cash crunch crisis building up in the retirement funds as well as the amendment of EPF Act 1991 to prevent retirees from withdrawing their savings.

In a statement, the experts said the death penalty usually targets ethnic minority groups and in some cases persons with disabilities who suffer from severe deterioration of their mental health due to prolonged periods of imprisonment.

“The death penalty is incompatible with fundamental tenets of human rights and dignity. We reiterate that the mandatory use of the death penalty constitutes an arbitrary deprivation of life and is a fundamental infringement upon the independence of judiciary and fair trial guarantees,” they said in the statement.

“It denies judges the possibility to consider the defendant’s personal circumstances or the circumstances of the particular offence and individualise the sentence. The mandatory death penalty is not compatible with the limitation of capital punishment to the 'most serious crimes.'""

They also said that the decision sends a strong signal supporting the abolition of the death penalty in a region where capital punishment is too often imposed for a broad range of crimes, and hoped that this would pave the way for the complete abolition in Malaysia and eventually the region.

""The majority of these offences do not meet the threshold of the most serious crimes, meaning those of extreme gravity involving intentional killing, which remains the only category of offence for which the death penalty can be imposed under international law,” they said.

The experts include: Morris Tidball-Binz, Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions; Tlaleng Mofokeng, Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health; Priya Gopalan, Matthew Gillett , Ganna Yudkivska, Miriam Estrada-Castillo and Mumba Malila from the Working Group on arbitrary detention; Fionnuala Ní Aoláin, Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism; Gerard Quinn, Special Rapporteur on the rights of persons with disabilities; and Fernand de Varennes, Special Rapporteur on Minority issues.

The experts are part of Special Procedures, who are independent experts in the UN Human Rights system who work voluntarily without wage and serve in their individual capacities.

In a separate statement, watchdog Human Rights Watch (HRW) said the abolition was an important step toward aligning with international human rights norms and growing global opposition to capital punishment.

Human Rights Watch Asia director Elaine Pearson also urged Malaysian lawmakers to build on this momentum by taking further steps toward the total abolition of the punishment.

“The abolition of the mandatory death penalty brings Malaysia closer to the majority of countries that have eliminated capital punishment altogether,” said Pearson.

“Malaysia’s next step should be ending its use of the punishment entirely and commuting the sentences of the 1,300 prisoners sitting on death row.”

Last week, the Parliament passed a Bill that proposed to make the death penalty an option and no longer mandatory. It was passed via a voice vote after it was tabled for its third reading, and would now need to be approved in the Dewan Negara as well before being presented to the Yang di-Pertuan Agong for royal assent.

The Abolition of Mandatory Death Penalty Bill would give judges the discretion on the death penalty rather than requiring them to do so when convicting on offences that made them mandatory.

The amendments in the Bill also include replacing life and natural life imprisonment (until death) as an alternative to the mandatory death sentence, with the new alternative of jail of between 30 and 40 years as well as no fewer than 12 strokes of the cane.","KUALA LUMPUR, April 12 — Human rights experts in the United Nations (UN) have praised Malaysia's decision to revoke the mandatory death penalty in the Dewan Rakyat recently, saying it has bolstered the global trend towards universal abolition.

https://www.malaymail.com/news/world/2023/04/11/frances-macron-stirs-confusion-criticism-with-taiwan-comments/64327,"France’s Macron stirs confusion, criticism with Taiwan comments","PARIS, April 11 — French President Emmanuel Macron risks creating fresh confusion among his Western allies and encouraging China with his latest headline-grabbing foreign policy comments, this time on Taiwan, analysts say.

Returning from a trip to China, the 45-year-old French leader told the US-based Politico site and France’s Les Echos newspaper that Europe shouldn’t be a “follower” of the United States in the event of conflict with China over Taiwan.

“The worst thing would be to think that we Europeans must be followers and adapt ourselves to the American rhythm and a Chinese overreaction,” Macron was quoted as saying.

He added that Europe “should not be caught up in a disordering of the world and crises that aren’t ours”.

Such comments could be seen as longstanding French foreign policy, which seeks to underline French autonomy, and they also reflect growing unease in Europe about the continent being sucked into a confrontation between China and the United States.

But many analysts and politicians in Europe and the United States questioned the timing — when Washington is investing billions in European security through its support for Ukraine, and when Western unity is seen as particularly important.

“In terms of communication, it’s a fiasco,” Antoine Bondaz, a China expert at the Foundation for Strategic Research, a Paris-based think-tank, told AFP.

He said Macron had implied that Washington was responsible for tensions over Taiwan, rather than China.

“You have a revisionist power which wants to take control of Taiwan, which wants to change the status quo, but you present the United States as being responsible for the instability? It’s a complete reversal of the responsibility for the tensions,” Bondaz said.

He suggested the biggest impact would be China believing that France — and perhaps Europe — would not intervene if Beijing invaded and seized control of Taiwan.

“It weakens the deterrence,” Bondaz said. “And if there was one lesson that we should have learned from Ukraine, it’s that we didn’t succeed in deterring (Russian President Vladimir) Putin.”

‘Strategic nonsense’

In the United States, the White House on Monday sought to play down the controversy, saying the United States had a “terrific bilateral relationship” with France.

But Republican Senator Marco Rubio posted a video online suggesting that Washington should re-think its own priorities.

“If Macron speaks for all of Europe, and their position now is, they’re not going to pick sides between the US and China over Taiwan, maybe then we should not be taking sides either . . . and (let them) handle Ukraine,” Rubio said.

Influential Republican Senator Lindsey Graham tweeted that Macron’s visit to Beijing “emboldens the communists and (Chinese) President Xi who seems to be hell bent on rewriting world order and taking Taiwan by force.”

Ivo Daalder, the head of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and a former advisor to US ex-president Barack Obama, also objected to Macron’s view that Europe should not get caught up “in crises that are not ours.”

“But he is perfectly fine with relying on US security commitments to address crises like Ukraine in Europe. That’s not ‘strategic autonomy’. That’s strategic nonsense,” Daalder wrote on Twitter.

Norbert Roettgen, a conservative German lawmaker and foreign policy expert, told Bild newspaper that “Macron seems to have completely lost his senses.”

‘Element of ego’

The French president’s office sought to downplay the comments today.

“Europeans have their own interests and acknowledge them transparently and with loyalty towards their allies and international partners,” an aide said.

“The president has often said that France is not equidistant between the United States and China. The United States is an ally. We share common values.”

But other observers pointed to other past examples when Macron has antagonised allies, such as when he called the Nato military alliance “brain dead” in 2019 or when he suggested Putin should not be “humiliated” in Ukraine last year.

“A misunderstanding can be an explanation once,” Le Monde newspaper wrote today. “But when it happens so often, it’s the way of conducting foreign policy that is at fault.”

Macron has often talked up his willingness to be “disruptive” as a political leader and he has sought to position himself as a visionary leader in Europe.

But critics see him as out-of-touch and frequently over-confident in his own ability to influence others.

Mujtaba Rahman, a European affairs expert from the London-based Eurasia Group, said that the timing of Macron’s comments on Taiwan was “poor”.

But he added on Twitter that it was “most likely just Macron being Macron, thinking ahead in an interesting way but not measuring the immediate political impact of his words.”

But for Bondaz “it’s his personality and there’s an element of ego.”

He argued Macron is “convinced that he understands better than diplomats and experts who are working on these issues every day.” — AFP","PARIS, April 11 — French President Emmanuel Macron risks creating fresh confusion among his Western allies and encouraging China with his latest headline-grabbing foreign policy comments, this time on Taiwan, analysts say.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/world-stocks-hope-fed-pause-dollar-stalls-3409436,"World stocks hope for Fed pause, dollar stalls","NEW YORK : A gauge of global stocks rose and bond yields edged higher on Tuesday as traders anticipate that interest rates will soon peak even as the market bets that the U.S. Federal Reserve will tighten monetary policy further in May to tame inflation.

Gold climbed back up above the key $2,000 per ounce level as the dollar came off Monday's peak, while oil prices rose despite Chinese inflation data pointing to persistently weak demand.

Investors are eagerly awaiting U.S. consumer prices data on Wednesday and producer prices on Thursday. The consumer price index is expected to show core inflation rose 0.4 per cent on a monthly basis and 5.6 per cent year-over-year in March, according to a Reuters poll of economists.

Core CPI appears likely to trough at 5.0 per cent in September before moving higher, should the current path persist, as prices for services rise further, Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse, said in a note.

GRAPHIC: Sticky prices vex central banks https://www.reuters.com/graphics/USA-FED/INFLATION/klpygmdrdpg/chart.png

The two-year Treasury yield, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations, rose 5.2 basis points to 4.060 per cent - double the Fed's inflation target of 2 per cent.

""The bond market continues to move higher in price and lower in yield, anticipating a Fed pause in terms of interest rate hikes and a pivot at some point,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. ""We think the bond market is way ahead of itself.""

Futures show a 72.7 per cent likelihood that the Fed will raise rates by 25 basis points to a range of 5.0 per cent-5.25 per cent when policymakers conclude a two-day meeting on May 3, CME Group's FedWatch tool shows.

But markets are pricing the Fed to cut its target rate to 4.416 per cent by December as the economy slows and potentially enters a recession.

""The Fed could surprise us and pause"" in May, Ghriskey said. ""But they're very unlikely to roll over at this point. They are determined to crush inflation.""

The Fed should be cautious about raising rates in the face of recent banking stress, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said, noting that a pullback in bank lending would help quell inflation and leave less for monetary policy to do.

The U.S. central bank's policy path will depend on incoming data, New York Fed President John Williams said, adding that he had yet to see much sign of credit conditions tightening and it would take time to see how that played out.

The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes rose 2.2 basis points to 3.437 per cent, while the 10-year German bund's yield rose 0.9 basis points to 2.312 per cent

Equity markets in Europe rallied after a long four-day Easter holiday, while the S&P 500 edged up and the Nasdaq slid. Large U.S. banks on Friday kick off earnings season that is expected overall to show a decline in profits, though banks are considered undervalued after a sell-off in March.

MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.61 per cent. The pan-European STOXX 600 index closed up 0.62 per cent and Japan's blue-chip Nikkei added 1.05 per cent.

On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.5 per cent, the S&P 500 gained 0.31 per cent and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.07 per cent.

Bolstering the case for global inflation to ease further this year, data showed China's consumer inflation hit an 18-month low and factory-gate price declines sped up in March as demand remained weak.

Meanwhile, investor morale in the euro zone improved in April after a surprise dip in March, a survey showed.

South Korea's central bank held rates steady for a second consecutive meeting on Tuesday, while the Bank of Canada is expected to leave rates unchanged when it meets on Wednesday.

The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday trimmed its 2023 global growth outlook slightly as higher interest rates cool activity but warned a severe flare-up of financial system turmoil could slash output to near recessionary levels.

Investor sentiment has also been boosted by signs that turmoil in the banking sector is easing after the two largest bank failures since the financial crisis rocked the banking system and rattled depositors, Fed data last week showed.

The dollar fell after a strong U.S. jobs report for March showed a resilient labor market, adding to expectations of another Fed rate hike. The data on Friday showed employers added 236,000 jobs while the unemployment rate fell to 3.5 per cent.

The dollar index fell 0.244 per cent, with the euro up 0.41 per cent to $1.0904 and the yen weakening 0.12 per cent at 133.78 per dollar.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/china-drop-demand-development-bank-debt-restructuring-losses-source-3411311,China to drop demand for development bank debt restructuring losses -source,"WASHINGTON :China is expected to drop its demand for multilateral development banks to share losses alongside other creditors in sovereign debt restructurings for poor nations, removing a major roadblock to debt relief, a source familiar with the plans said.

The development is expected at a high-level sovereign debt roundtable on Wednesday on the sidelines of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund Spring meetings in Washington.

Beijing would no longer insist multilateral lenders take ""haircuts"" on loans to poor countries, the source said on Tuesday, while the IMF and World Bank agreed to ensure their debt sustainability analyses of countries undergoing debt restructurings would be made available to Chinese authorities earlier in the process.

IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva at an event during the meetings confirmed that the Fund had agreed to provide earlier debt sustainability information to creditors so they could better prepare for restructurings. She also said the World Bank was being asked to show how it could be a net positive provider of financing and concessional loans.

The IMF, World Bank and the U.S. Treasury have argued to Beijing that such concessional loans to debt-distressed countries were the equivalent of taking principal losses on loans.

""I'm so far optimistic. I hope to remain optimistic after tomorrow when we are meeting,"" Georgieva told the Bretton Woods Committee event. She added that an April 3 deputies meeting for the sovereign debt roundtable went well.

Georgieva's comments echoed optimism earlier from U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen that China would agree on certain technical aspects of debt restructuring for poor countries.

""I've been encouraged by China's willingness to provide specific assurances with respect to Sri Lanka. I regard that as a positive sign,"" Yellen told a news briefing at the start of the spring meetings.

Charles Robertson, global chief economist with Renaissance Capital, said the agreement would be significant for emerging nations struggling with debt.

""If China's now prepared to accept the exemption for multilateral development banks, debt restructuring can happen quicker, or get back to the speed it used to be,"" Robertson told Reuters. He added that earlier access to the debt sustainability information was significant for China.

""It should give them more influence and power - more chance to determine the eventual look of the debt restructuring.""

China would participate in the meeting on Wednesday on the sidelines of the Washington gathering, Yellen said, adding that she would continue to press Beijing to help improve the Group of 20 Common Framework set up to provide debt relief for low-income countries.

""I'm hopeful that we will actually get a bit of progress coming out of this first meeting of the sovereign debt roundtable on a set of technical issues that I think pertain to some important elements of debt restructuring,"" Yellen said. ""I feel encouraged that we have made a bit of progress and I hope to make more.""

DEBT DISCUSSIONS

The IMF, World Bank and India, current president of the G20, are co-chairing the Global Sovereign Debt Roundtable with a goal of accelerating debt relief for countries in need. The co-chairs are expected to issue a statement after Wednesday's meeting.

A first limited gathering was held on the sidelines of the G20 finance leaders meeting in India in February, amid ongoing delays in finalizing debt treatment agreements for Zambia, Ghana and Ethiopia.

U.S. officials and others blame the delays largely on foot-dragging by China, now the world's largest bilateral creditor, and reluctance by private-sector creditors.","WASHINGTON :China is expected to drop its demand for multilateral development banks to share losses alongside other creditors in sovereign debt restructurings for poor nations, removing a major roadblock to debt relief, a source familiar with the plans said.

I had expected worse, given the ubiquity of the QWERTY keyboards and upmarket styli. An Apple Pencil costs nearly as much as a Parker Vacuumatic from the 1930s, but the modern professional will arguably get more use out of the former.

It is unclear if the fountain pen’s time is well and truly over, or if a resurgence – like what’s happening with film photography and vinyl music – is underway. Who’s buying them and what are their reasons?

AFICIONADOS THEN AND NOW

In Bernard’s books, writing with a vintage fountain pen is a sensation unlike any other. Compared to their mass-produced counterparts, which “pay little mind to the craft”, it glides on like butter and scarcely scratches the surface of paper.

“It writes beautifully and has a calligraphic quality. Doctors use them and when nurses say, 'Wow! Your penmanship is very nice', it makes them feel good.”

In the past, a fountain pen was a luxury reserved for doctors, lawyers and architects. Not only because they could afford it more than others, but also because the art of writing has had a much longer run in these professions. Apparently, no lack of high-profile individuals have stepped foot into Pek Kay Lee.

“My father told me that Lee Kuan Yew’s mother came to our shop once. We don’t have a photograph because we didn’t have a spare camera lying around.

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singapore-flagged-tanker-boarded-by-pirates-near-ivory-coast,Singapore-flagged tanker boarded by pirates near Ivory Coast; one Singaporean on board,"SINGAPORE - A Singapore-flagged tanker was boarded by pirates around 570km from Ivory Coast in western Africa at about 10pm on Monday.

The incident was first flagged by the Maritime Domain Awareness for Trade-Gulf of Guinea, a joint maritime monitoring effort by France and Britain. It said that an “unknown number” of pirates boarded the tanker about 300 nautical miles south of the city of Abidjan.

As at Tuesday, the situation continues to be classified as ongoing. No further details were provided.

In response to queries from The Straits Times, the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) said there are 20 crew members of various nationalities on board the vessel.

One of them is a Singaporean.

The vessel, identified as the Success 9 by security consultant Praesidium International, is a chemical and oil product tanker.

It was last sighted off the coast of Abidjan on March 22, the day it departed the port.

MPA said it is working closely with HS Ocean, the vessel’s Singapore-registered owner; the Monrovia Regional Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre; and the Information Fusion Centre at the Changi Command and Control Centre to monitor the situation and give assistance.

Meanwhile, the UK-based security consultant EOS Risk Group has warned vessels to keep clear of the area.

“It is likely that another vessel was used to support the pirates during the incident. Either a mothership was used to deploy a skiff, or a secondary tanker is in the vicinity to illegally offload the boarded vessel’s cargo,” it said.

The latest pirate attack comes after a similar incident on March 26 involving the Monjasa Reformer, a chemical and oil tanker sailing under the Liberian flag. That took place about 260km off Pointe-Noire in the Republic of the Congo.

“(It) exemplifies West African pirates’ ability to conduct piracy at great range from the shore,” added the security consultant.","SINGAPORE - A Singapore-flagged tanker was boarded by pirates around 570km from Ivory Coast in western Africa at about 10pm on Monday.

Her comments come as central bankers, finance ministers and other participants gather in Washington for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank’s spring meetings this week, where global growth and debt restructuring feature among key topics on the agenda.

While the IMF warned in a report released on Tuesday that chances of a “hard landing” for the world economy have risen on the back of financial sector stress, Dr Yellen told reporters: “I’ve not really seen evidence at this stage suggesting a contraction in credit.”

But she acknowledged that this is a possibility, while stressing that the US banking system remains resilient.

She said she is not anticipating a downturn in the economy even if that remains a risk.

Dr Yellen added in a speech that there remains “considerable room for improvement” in the global debt restructuring process.

The World Bank has warned of an especially tough outlook for the poorest economies as global growth slows while countries grapple with heavy debt burdens and weak investment.

Also this week, ministers from both creditor and debtor countries, as well as representatives of private creditors, will convene for a global sovereign debt roundtable.

Dr Yellen said she looks forward to “robust discussion on improvements to the Common Framework process for low-income countries and the debt treatment process more broadly”, referring to the Group of 20 mechanism designed to support low-income countries with unsustainable debt.

She noted China’s willingness to provide specific assurances in Sri Lanka’s case recently “as a positive sign”, with Beijing’s moves enabling the IMF to proceed with a financial support and economic reform programme.

China visit on the cards

Dr Yellen still hopes to visit China at “the appropriate time” as well, given that US President Joe Biden has emphasised the importance of opening up and maintaining communication channels.

Meanwhile, the US remains “vigilant” in the face of risks to the economy, she said, as countries continue tackling fallout from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine while recovering from the coronavirus pandemic.

“In some countries, including the United States, there have been recent pressures on our banking systems,” she added.

“I’ve been in close communication with my counterparts over the past few weeks on these developments and I look forward to continuing that dialogue this week,” she said.

On Washington’s pursuit of “friend-shoring”, or deepening economic ties with trusted partners, Dr Yellen pushed back on the idea that this process would cause fragmentation.

https://www.straitstimes.com/business/twitter-company-no-longer-exists-is-now-part-of-musk-s-x,"Twitter company ‘no longer exists’, is now part of Musk’s X","SINGAPORE – Twitter has ceased to be an independent company after merging with a newly formed shell firm called X, driving speculation about what billionaire Elon Musk intends for the social media platform.

Twitter “no longer exists” after being merged with X, according to an April 4 document submitted in a California court for a lawsuit filed against the company and its former chief executive Jack Dorsey in 2022 by conservative activist Laura Loomer.

It is unclear what the change means for Twitter, which has seen a sweeping overhaul since Mr Musk bought the company for US$44 billion (S$58.6 billion) in 2022.

Mr Musk has in the past suggested that buying Twitter would be an “accelerant” for creating X – which he dubbed an “everything app”.

He tweeted about the move on Tuesday with the single character, “X”.

The world’s second-richest man has professed his desire to make X similar to China’s WeChat, a super-app owned by Tencent used for everything from payments and booking event tickets to messaging.

But he has been vague about how it will fit in with his sprawling business empire, ranging from the electric car giant Tesla to Space Exploration Technologies.

Mr Musk also owns the domain “X.com” – the name of the online payments company he started and eventually merged with PayPal.

Mr Musk first set up a trio of holding companies in Delaware with a variation of the name “X Holdings” in April 2022 as part of his takeover bid for Twitter. But X was established on March 9 in Nevada, according to records filed in the state.

Its merger with Twitter was submitted on March 15.

“It is understood in the corporate world that incorporating Nevada is what you do if you want to have fewer fiduciary obligations,” said Professor Ann Lipton, associate dean at Tulane University’s law school. “It’s just harder to sue officers and directors of Nevada companies for breach of fiduciary obligations if you’re an investor.”

Twitter was previously incorporated in Delaware, and Mr Musk’s battle over acquiring the company took place in its Chancery Court.

Twitter, which no longer has a team handling media queries, did not immediately comment on questions sent by Bloomberg News.

Lawyers for the law firm representing Twitter in the case, Willkie Farr and Gallagher, also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The move sparked intense speculation on Twitter about what it meant, with Mr Musk’s tweet attracting more than 13 million views within hours.

In Japan, the topic “Twitter Gone” started trending, with users joking that Twitter’s new name will resemble that of a local rock band, X Japan.

“Musk could create a parent structure, similar to Alphabet, where he has all his companies,” said Mr Mandeep Singh, analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence. “I don’t see how he can layer e-commerce or payments in Twitter right when larger peers such as Alphabet and Meta have struggled to become an ‘everything app’ on the consumer side.” BLOOMBERG","It is unclear what the change means for Twitter, which has seen a sweeping overhaul since Mr Musk bought the company for US$44 billion (S$58.6 billion) in 2022.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/biden-lands-belfast-vow-keep-peace-3409491,Biden lands in Belfast with vow to 'keep the peace',"BELFAST: US President Joe Biden landed in Northern Ireland on Tuesday (Apr 11), hoping to help maintain the fragile peace brokered 25 years ago after decades of sectarian violence over British rule.

Before boarding Air Force One, Biden, 80, said the priority for his trip was ""to keep the peace"" and bring an end to the protracted political deadlock caused by opposition among pro-UK parties to post-Brexit trading rules.

UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak met Biden on the tarmac when he touched down in the Northern Irish capital, just 24 hours after the landmark anniversary of the Good Friday/Belfast Agreement.

But security remains a concern.

On Monday, masked youths pelted police vehicles with petrol bombs during an illegal march by dissident republicans in Londonderry, which is also known as Derry.

Despite the scenes, US officials said Biden was ""very excited for this trip"".

""We'd like to see the national assembly (in Belfast) returned, clearly,"" National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters en route to Belfast, with the Stormont legislature currently suspended.

""The message is twofold. It's congratulations on 25 years of the Good Friday agreement ... (and) to talk about the importance of trying to work on trade and economic policies that benefit all communities as well as the United States,"" he said.

Biden will deliver remarks Wednesday at Ulster University in Belfast, set to focus on the economic promise of inward investment if the peace endures.

He will also meet the leaders of Northern Ireland's main political parties, the White House said, with reports he will press the pro-UK Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) to resume power-sharing.

Devolved government in Belfast is a key plank of the peace accords but it collapsed 14 months ago over the party's trenchant opposition to post-Brexit trade arrangements in Northern Ireland.

Biden, who has Irish ancestry, will also travel south to Ireland for a three-day visit, in part tracing his family history.

The trip will include an address to a joint sitting of Ireland's parliament and ""celebrate the deep, historic ties"" the country shares with the United States, the White House says.

FRAGILE PEACE

Northern Ireland has been significantly reshaped since unionist parties wanting to remain part of the UK and nationalists favouring reunification with Ireland struck the peace deal on Apr 10, 1998.

But a quarter-century on, the post-Brexit trading situation and demographic shifts are prompting fresh political instability and violence from hardliners on both sides.

""While it is time to reflect on the solid progress we have made together, we must also recommit to redoubling our efforts on the promise made in 1998 and the agreements that followed,"" Sunak said to mark Monday's anniversary.

In Dublin, Biden will meet Irish President Michael Higgins and the Taoiseach (prime minister) Leo Varadkar on Thursday, when he will also take part in peace ceremonies, address the Irish parliament and attend a banquet dinner at Dublin Castle.

During a trip to County Mayo in northwest Ireland on Friday, Biden will visit his ancestral hometown of Ballina and meet distant cousins.

The US president is due to address thousands in the place that his family left in the mid-19th century - when the country was ravaged by famine - before they eventually settled in blue-collar Scranton, Pennsylvania.","BELFAST: US President Joe Biden landed in Northern Ireland on Tuesday (Apr 11), hoping to help maintain the fragile peace brokered 25 years ago after decades of sectarian violence over British rule.

https://www.malaymail.com/news/opinion/2023/04/12/winning-the-first-masters-title-at-augusta-national-jon-rahm/64379,Winning the first Masters title at Augusta National — Jon Rahm,"APRIL 12 — It’s very hard to put it into words what it means for me to win the Masters Tournament. We all dream of things like this as players, and you try to visualise what it’s going to be like and what it’s going to feel like when you achieve this goal.

When I hit my third shot into the 18th green on Sunday, I could tell it was close by the crowd’s reaction and the wave of emotion of so many things just overtook me. I’d never thought I was going to cry by winning a golf tournament, but I got very close to doing so at the end. A lot of it is because of what winning the Masters means to me, and to Spanish golf. It’s Spain’s 10th major victory, the fourth Spaniard to win the Masters, and my second career major title. It’s a pretty incredible feeling.

The history of the game is a big part of why I compete and one of the reasons why I play this game is because of the late, Seve Ballesteros. If it wasn’t for the Ryder Cup at Valderrama in 1997 where he was the European team captain, I really don’t know where I would be or where as a family we would be today, as it was at that event my family fell in love and got involved with the game of golf.

For me to win the Masters on the 40th anniversary of Seve’s second Masters win, and also on what would have been his 66th birthday and Easter Sunday, is so incredibly meaningful. To finish off the tournament the way I did with an unusual par, which is very much a Seve par, it was in a non-purposeful way, a testament to him. I know Seve was pulling for me and this one is for Seve. He was up there helping, and help he did. There is a lot of pride in winning the Masters and I’m really proud of myself. To play the way I did with only one bogey in the final round under difficult conditions and later coming in with a good lead — it is hard to explain. It still really hasn’t sunk in yet.

I also find it hard to believe I’m the first European golfer to win a US Open and Masters Tournament. If there’s anything better than accomplishing a feat like this, it is making golf history. It is a very humbling feeling to know I accomplished something like this considering the many great players that have come before me. It’s a pretty good duo of majors and to get that done, I can’t help to feel anything but thankful.

During the final round, I was calm despite starting two back of Brooks Koepka. I knew I needed to bring the fight to him. When I got to the fourth tee tied with Brooks, the goal was to keep giving him something to think about. If I hit a good shot or have a birdie chance, I wanted him to see that and I wanted to keep putting the ball in the fairway and making good swings for him to feel more of the pressure rather than me. I felt I did that really, really well.

After I got the lead on the sixth, the goal at that point was to not come back to the rest of the field, and to have them chase me. I knew I could make a few birdies and pars on the back nine and it was going to be pretty difficult for someone to catch up, especially with the wind conditions.

My lead narrowed very, very quickly and it made the 10th, 11th and 12th holes a lot harder for me. I might have looked calm, but I was definitely nervous. I’m glad that’s the way it looked! That’s what you strive for and you don’t want to panic when you’re fighting for the tournament. I felt comfortable with my game and I had a plan to execute.

What is going on on the outside is not always a reflection of the inside. I never allowed myself to get too frustrated. I never felt like anything was out of control, but obviously you’re nervous and there’s always tension. The only time I was a little upset was actually in the morning during the conclusion of the third round on the 16th hole. As I had three-putted 13, three-putted 15, and then hit a terrible shot on 16 and made a bogey, I felt like at least one of those shots was avoidable. That was the only time I was truly upset. But I reeled it back in quickly and made two good pars on the last two holes to put myself in the final group, which was what I needed. All I had asked for was a chance.

Walking up to the 18th tee box with a four-shot lead, I felt confident. I think it was karma as I was telling my caddie Adam (Hayes) how great I have been hitting a low fade the entire week. And of course on 18, I hit an average drive which was maybe two feet from missing that tree on the right and fell well short of the fairway. I guess it will be a good story in the future .... I won the Masters and didn’t even make it to the fairway on the 18th tee shot! However, I’d rather want to remember my second shot on the 14th hole, because if there was a key moment throughout the day, it was that shot. To be able to hit it to four feet from being out of position was incredible.

I’ve always been confident when I’ve been close to the lead. I have full faith in all parts of my game. And maybe because we had difficult conditions, I was just so focused on what I had to do. We’ve put in a lot of effort to try and beat the best guys in the world. So maybe that level of intensity and that determination is what you see and that’s why I’m characterised as a fighter. I’m really proud of myself for winning this.

https://www.malaymail.com/news/world/2023/04/11/bold-chinese-vessels-frustrate-taiwans-fishing-communities/64306,Bold Chinese vessels frustrate Taiwan’s fishing communities,"MATSU (Taiwan), April 11 — Taiwanese fisherman Wang Chia-wen contends with Chinese incursions every day, although not usually the kind staged by Beijing’s military during its latest round of war games.

Fish stocks around Taiwan’s tiny Matsu archipelago, a chain of rocky islands near the Chinese mainland, are crucial for the livelihoods of residents but the intruding crews are eating away at them.

Island authorities are under-resourced and locals say they are helpless to stop the hostile competition that doesn’t respect the median line, an unofficial boundary in the Taiwan Strait that Beijing refuses to recognise.

“Everyone is frustrated. It has become a common occurrence,” said Wang, 45.

“They come very close to the shore. We can see each other. They act as if they don’t see us, but there’s nothing much we can do.”

The boats are harming livelihoods as well as the seabeds and marine ecosystem of Taiwan, which has one of the world’s largest fishing industries, in their search for fish, squid and crabs.

Some officials say it could be part of Beijing’s “grey zone” tactics, a non-military means of coercion that keeps pressure on the self-ruled island.

“With any type of grey zone harassment, there’s always this component of deniability. It might be civilian, and it might be intentional,” said Lii Wen, director of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party’s Matsu office.

Chinese officials have described China as a responsible fishing country that opposes illegal and unregulated fishing.

‘Every day’

The Taiwanese coast guard often finds itself chasing Chinese vessels that fish illegally in the sprawling island chain’s waters.

But they are regularly too late, locals say, especially if the Chinese boats come at night.

Authorities still managed to expel 1,291 Chinese fishing vessels from its waters last year, according to Taiwan’s Coast Guard Administration data.

Such incidents bring both sides into dangerously close contact.

“Any type of accident or unpredictable events could lead to larger tensions or escalate tensions in unexpected ways,” said Lii.

At the sleepy fishing harbour of Qiao Zi on Matsu’s Beigan island, crews worked to fix their boats while amateur anglers sat at the end of a small jetty casting their lines into the ocean.

Chiu Ching-chih, clad in stained overalls and black Wellington boots, showed off a fresh catch of seabass jumping around behind him at the end of his working day.

The 51-year-old said Chinese incursions were incessant and islanders felt powerless to stop them.

“It has become very frequent, you can see them every day,” he said.

‘Make ends meet’

Another threat to their stocks is squid fishing by Chinese light boats, which locals say shine LEDs from Chinese waters that have at times turned Matsu’s skies a luminous green.

“There is an indirect impact because they attract the small fish to their side. Big fish from our side will also go to their side,” Chiu said.

Crew on Chinese boats have also thrown stones at their Taiwanese rivals, shattering windows, and even cut their expensive nets to gain the upper hand.

“The impact has been very serious. Their fishing nets overlap with ours. They won’t cut their own net and they will damage our nets,” said Wang’s brother, 44-year-old Chia-ling.

A fishing net can cost between 200,000 and 300,000 Taiwanese dollars (RM28,970-RM43,456).

Other tactics used by the Chinese vessels condemned by the Taiwanese islanders include blast fishing with dynamite that ruins the seabed and the ecosystem below the waves.

Locals compare it to killing the hen to get the egg.

They also accuse the Chinese crews of using electrofishing — stunning fish to catch them.

With the threat of incursions ever-present, the Matsu locals now question if they will be able to carry on, or even be able to feed their families in the future.

“Illegal fishing in our water does the most harm to us. The catch will become fewer and fewer. We have to make a living too,” said Chiu.

He said a kilo of fish can fetch 400 Taiwanese dollars.

“If we are unable to make ends meet, maybe one day we might have to give up fishing.” — AFP","Chinese officials have described China as a responsible fishing country that opposes illegal and unregulated fishing.

Citing people familiar with the talks, the Journal said the new plan, if agreed, could see China drop its demand for multilateral lenders such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund to join it in taking losses in any debt-restructuring deals that has stood as an obstacle to reaching workouts for countries like Zambia and Ghana.

That concession would be in return for multilateral lenders and regional partners such as the Asian Development Bank and African Development Bank making more explicit commitments to provide fresh low-cost financing, including grants, to countries whose debt is being restructured, the Journal said.

Specifically, the new plan could help break an impasse that has held up an agreement by China and other government creditors to restructure the debts of Zambia and serve as a model for multibillion-dollar debt-relief deals for other developing countries in financial distress, the people told the Journal.

Negotiations could then move on to the details of Zambia’s debt restructuring, such as extending repayment deadlines and lowering interest rates. China continues to oppose taking losses on the face value of its loans, people close to Beijing’s decision-making told the paper.

Top officials from China will attend the World Bank and International Monetary Fund spring meetings in Washington this week, their first attendance in person in three years after COVID-19 curbs limited them to virtual participation.

The Chinese officials are expected to take part in Wednesday's Global Sovereign Debt Roundtable meeting to discuss the matter.

At 9am, the local note rose to 4.4145/4180 versus the greenback from yesterday’s closing rate of 4.4160/4210.

Bank Muamalat Malaysia Bhd chief economist and social finance Mohd Afzanizam Abdul Rashid said market participants would synthesise their views on the US rates based on the highly anticipated US CPI print.

“The series of US Federal Reserve’s speeches this week could also shape market players’ conviction which we think will tilt to the hawkish side,” he told Bernama.

Meanwhile, in its latest World Economic Outlook report, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has downgraded its global gross domestic product growth forecast for 2023 and 2024 to 2.8 per cent and 3.0 per cent, respectively.

Mohd Afzanizam said this represents a 0.1 percentage point cut from January’s forecast, attributed to the stubbornly high inflation as well as the recent financial sector turmoil that could undermine the baseline scenario for a soft landing.

“As for the ringgit, it will continue to stay soft at around RM4.41-RM4.42 today as investors are expected to remain guarded,” he said.

The ringgit was traded mostly higher against a basket of major currencies this morning, with the exception of the euro as it had depreciated to 4.8224/8262 against the currency from 4.8196/8251 at Tuesday’s close.

The move will be among key themes of G7 discussions that Japan chairs this year, as part of efforts to address challenges the global community face from fast-moving digital technology, he said.

“We have to address risks from the development of CBDC by ensuring factors such as appropriate transparency and sound governance,” Kanda, vice finance minister for international affairs, told a seminar in Washington.

“As a priority of this year, the G7 will consider how best to help developing countries introduce CBDC consistent with appropriate standards, including the G7 public policy principle for retail CBDC,” he said.

Outside the G7, China has been leading the pack on issuing a digital currency. G7 central banks have set common standards toward issuing CBDCs as some proceed with experiments.

Kanda said the rapid innovation of digital technology provides various benefits but also fresh challenges such as cyber-security, the spread of misinformation, social and political divides, and the risk of destabilising financial markets.

The collapse of crypto exchange FTX last year “was a serious wake-up call” for policymakers to create regulation across borders, he said.

“For crypto assets, there are a bit of diverging views among countries. But consensus is definitely that we need more regulation, particularly after the FTX shock,” Kanda said.

Another priority of this year's G7 talks will be to address debt vulnerabilities of some middle-income countries, said Kanda, who is among policymakers gathering in Washington for the spring International Monetary Fund (IMF) meetings this week.

Kanda said it might be “a bit difficult” to see concrete results for countries like Zambia, Ghana and Ethiopia, when asked what the accomplishments for debt talks could be this week.

https://www.malaymail.com/news/world/2023/04/11/biden-heads-to-northern-ireland-at-delicate-political-juncture/64343,Biden heads to Northern Ireland at delicate political juncture,"BELFAST, April 11 — US President Joe Biden will arrive in Belfast later today at a delicate political time in Northern Ireland as he helps mark the 25-year anniversary of a peace deal that largely ended 30 years of bloodshed there.

Biden, known for decades for his pro-Irish views, will need to tread carefully as the largest pro-British unionist party continues to boycott the devolved power-sharing government that was a fundamental part of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement.

Biden is expected to meet representatives from the five main Northern Irish parties tomorrow in advance of his speech at Belfast’s Ulster University but was not planning to pressure them, a senior administration official said.

“Twenty-five years ago, Northern Ireland’s leaders chose peace. I look forward to marking the anniversary in Belfast, underscoring the US commitment to preserving peace and encouraging prosperity,” Biden said on Twitter.

Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has said Biden’s visit — the first by a US president in 10 years — will not pressure it to end its protest at post-Brexit trade rules that treat the province differently to the rest of the United Kingdom.

The European Union and UK agreed to ease many of the trade barriers in a recent deal endorsed by Biden. The DUP wants further changes but London has said that is not possible.

Biden clashed with the British government at times during the Brexit talks, drawing a rebuke from DUP lawmakers.

Biden, who will be greeted by British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on his arrival ahead of a meeting between the two on Wednesday, will float the possibility of closer investment ties between the US and Northern Ireland to try to encourage an end to the impasse.

‘We do need help’

However, the latest political stalemate is set to overshadow the visit and the anniversary of the peace deal the US helped broker between Irish nationalists seeking a united Ireland and pro-British unionists wanting to remain part of the UK.

“It might spur things along and maybe things will be taken a bit more seriously,” said Niamh McNutt, a 21-year-old student advisor in Belfast, where security was tight ahead of the visit. “We do need help right now to get things in order and maybe this will give people the push that they need.”

There is still some sporadic violence by small groups opposed to the peace process and police were attacked with petrol bombs at a parade opposing the agreement in Londonderry on Monday.

Britain’s MI5 intelligence agency recently increased the threat level in Northern Ireland from domestic terrorism to “severe” — meaning an attack is highly likely. It has been mostly at that level since its introduction in 2010.

Biden, who speaks proudly of his Irish roots and frequently quotes Irish poets such as Seamus Heaney, will then spend three days in Ireland, where he will address the parliament in Dublin, meet Prime Minister Leo Varadkar and visit his ancestral homes on either coast.

""When I learned about a foreign tourist who had to pay RM120 for a haircut, I immediately ordered the officers to investigate.

""If it's true, let's ensure that those involved will be strictly dealt with. Not only did they charge excessively, but the action tarnished Malaysia's good name,” Mr Salahuddin was quoted by NST as saying.

""As a tourist destination, we should offer the best services and reasonable prices.”

Mr Salahuddin also stressed that businesses should not take advantage of any situation to “make excessive profits”.

“We are continuously advising that all traders must abide and ensure that services provided to Malaysians or foreigners must be reasonable, and do not over-charge or take the opportunity to make excessive profits,” he told reporters, according to Bernama.

He added that if the allegation was true, stern action would be taken under the Price Control and Anti-Profiteering Act 2011. Under the Act, it is an offence to take excessive profits on goods or services.

According to the ministry, if convicted, individuals are liable to a fine not exceeding RM100,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years or to both for the first offence. For a second or subsequent offence, individuals are liable to a fine not exceeding RM250,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years or both.

https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/canada-pledges-fresh-military-aid-for-ukraine-sanctions-on-russia,Canada vows more military aid for Ukraine as PM Trudeau’s website hacked,"OTTAWA – Canada on Tuesday imposed new sanctions over Russia’s invasion in Ukraine and pledged fresh military support for Kyiv after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau met Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal in Toronto.

As the two leaders met, Mr Trudeau’s official website was shut down and the Canadian spy service acknowledged that “some” other government pages had also been offline.

Canada will send to Ukraine 21,000 assault rifles, 38 machine guns and 2.4 million rounds of ammunition sourced from firearms manufacturer Colt Canada, while the new sanctions would target 14 Russian individuals and 34 entities.

Mr Trudeau said Canada was also imposing sanctions on nine entities tied to the Belarusian financial sector to further pressure Russia’s “enablers in Belarus”.

Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a “special military operation” to combat what it describes as a security threat from Ukraine’s ties to the West.

“We will continue to support Ukraine with everything needed for as long as necessary,” Mr Trudeau said.

“Ukraine feels the colossal support of Canada in every area... and we really appreciate it,” said Mr Shmyhal, the highest-ranking Ukrainian to visit Canada since the start of the war more than a year ago.

The two discussed a range of subjects, including further military support and reconstruction efforts in Ukraine, before signing a joint declaration to modernise trade between the two countries.

The Prime Minister’s official website on Tuesday morning showed a “service is unavailable” error when checked by Reuters.

Mr Trudeau said the cyber attacks were an “unsurprising” act by Russian hackers.

“It’s not uncommon for Russian hackers to target countries as they are showing their steadfast support for Ukraine,” Mr Trudeau said, adding that Canada was not going to be dissuaded by such attacks.

“We are aware of reports that some Government of Canada websites have been offline,” a spokesman for Canada’s Communications Security Establishment said, and echoed Mr Trudeau’s comment that it is not an uncommon occurrence in countries hosting visits by Ukrainian government officials.

“While these incidents draw attention, they have very little impact on the systems affected,” the spokesman said.

Canada has been one of the most vocal supporters of Ukraine and has committed more than C$8 billion (S$7.9 billion) to Ukraine in financial, military, humanitarian and other assistance since January 2022, just before the February invasion.

https://www.malaymail.com/news/sports/2023/04/12/haaland-hits-45-as-man-city-make-mark-against-bayern/64367,Haaland hits 45 as Man City make mark against Bayern,"MANCHESTER, April 12 — Erling Haaland scored his 45th goal of the season as Manchester City took a commanding 3-0 lead over Bayern Munich from their Champions League quarter-final, first leg today.

Rodri and Bernardo Silva were also on target for the English champions, who took a giant stride towards finally conquering Europe for the first time.

Victory was sweet for City boss Pep Guardiola as he came up against his former club for the first time since leaving Bayern for Manchester in 2016, but he warned that the job is not yet done.

“I’ve been three years there and I know in Europe this team is special. To knockout these type of teams you have to make two good games not just one,” said Guardiola.

“I know exactly what we have to do there, They are capable to score one, two, three goals. We have to do our game with huge personality.”

City also partially settled a Champions League score with Bayern boss Thomas Tuchel, who beat Guardiola’s men to lift the trophy as Chelsea manager in the 2021 final.

Tuchel was appointed less than three weeks ago by the German champions with one eye on this tie and he believed his side deserved more.

“I try to not allow my players to focus on the result because it is not the deserved result, it does not tell the story of this match,” said Tuchel.

“I’ve seen so many good things that I refuse to just focus on the result. You may say ‘that’s not Bayern’ but I was very proud on the sideline, we were courageous and showed the right character.”

City fought off interest from Bayern among other European giants to win the race to sign Haaland a year ago for nights like this and the Norwegian played his part in a clinical performance.

Haaland uncharacteristically fluffed his lines with the first big chance of the game when his weak shot was straight at Yann Sommer.

At the other end, City were grateful to a brilliant block from Ruben Dias to prevent Jamal Musiala putting Bayern in front.

Rodri then showed the forwards how it is done as the Spaniard took aim from long range on his weaker left foot and curled a sumptuous shot into the top corner on 27 minutes.

City turn the screw

Bayern picked up Sommer in the January window as an emergency measure after Manuel Neuer’s season was ended by a skiing accident.

The Swiss international proved the value of that move with a number of vital saves to keep Bayern in the tie, starting with an outstretched leg to deny Ilkay Gundogan.

But Bayern were made to regret not making their bright start to the second period count.

Leroy Sane twice came close to haunting his former club with powerful efforts that were beaten away by Ederson before Matthijs de Ligt and Kingsley Coman had headers from close range blocked by desperate City defending.

Instead, City turned the screw in the final quarter to take a potentially decisive lead to Bavaria next week.

Haaland showed there is more to his game than goals with a perfectly weighted cross for Silva to head in City’s second 20 minutes from time.

Sommer then produced a fine stop low to his left to turn Julian Alvarez’s shot to safety.

But City were not to be denied their third and Haaland his goal as he stretched out a telescopic right leg to turn John Stones’ knockdown beyond Sommer.

Alvarez fired another effort inches wide and Sommer needed finger tips to turn over Rodri’s header as City went in search of a final flourish.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/macron-taiwan-china-parliamentary-speaker-puzzled-3411686,Macron comments leave senior Taiwanese official 'puzzled',"TAIPEI : Comments by French President Emmanuel Macron on Taiwan are puzzling, a senior Taiwanese politician said, wondering whether France's founding ideals of liberty, equality and fraternity are now out of fashion.

Macron, in comments in an interview on a trip to China that was meant to showcase European unity on China policy, cautioned against being drawn into a crisis over Taiwan driven by an ""American rhythm and a Chinese overreaction"".

He also called for the European Union to reduce its dependence on the United States and to become a ""third pole"" in world affairs alongside Washington and Beijing.

Taiwan parliament speaker You Si-kun, writing on Facebook late Tuesday (Apr 11) above a screengrab of a report about Macron's comments on Taiwan, questioned the French commitment to freedom.

""Are 'liberté, égalité, fraternité' out of fashion?"" he wrote, referring to the official French motto of ""liberty, equality, fraternity"".

""Is it OK just to ignore this once it's part of the constitution? Or can advanced democratic countries ignore the lives and deaths of people in other countries?"" added You, one of the founders of Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party. ""The actions of President Macron, a leading international democracy, leave me puzzled.""

China has been staging military exercises around Taiwan since Saturday after Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen returned from a trip to the United States, where she met US House of Representatives Speaker Kevin McCarthy.

France, like most countries, has no formal diplomatic relations with Chinese-claimed Taiwan but maintains a de facto embassy in Taipei and has joined other US allies in underscoring the need for peace in the Taiwan Strait.

Taiwan's foreign ministry on Tuesday sought to downplay Macron's remarks, though said they had ""noted"" what he said.

""The Foreign Ministry expresses its thanks to France for expressing concern about peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait many times and in many different international venues,"" including, for example at the recent French-British leaders summit, spokesperson Jeff Liu told reporters. ""This is a continuation of France's consistent stance and position.""","TAIPEI : Comments by French President Emmanuel Macron on Taiwan are puzzling, a senior Taiwanese politician said, wondering whether France's founding ideals of liberty, equality and fraternity are now out of fashion.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/macrons-aim-eu-unity-china-undone-trip-fallout-3411111,Macron's aim of EU unity on China undone by trip fallout,"PARIS: French officials were in damage control mode on Tuesday (Apr 11) as they tried to contain anger, division and confusion sparked by President Emmanuel Macron's comments on Europe's dependence on the United States and its relations with China and Taiwan.

Macron's comments came in an interview on a trip to China that was meant to showcase European unity on China policy, with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen also taking part, but highlighted differences within the European Union.

In the interview with French daily Les Echos and news portal Politico published on Sunday, Macron called for the EU to reduce its dependence on the US and to become a ""third pole"" in world affairs alongside Washington and Beijing.

As European politicians and diplomats returned to work after the long Easter holiday weekend, they were still struggling to digest Macron's comments, in which he also cautioned against being drawn into a crisis over Taiwan driven by an ""American rhythm and a Chinese overreaction"".

While many of the remarks were not new, the timing of their publication - at the end of a high-profile trip to China, as Beijing carried out military exercises near Taiwan - and their bluntness annoyed countries in eastern Europe.

Many governments in that region see ties with the United States as sacrosanct, particularly given Washington's key role in helping Ukraine defend against Russia's invasion.

""The return of geopolitics means that we have to see more clearly who is our ally and who is not. Strong transatlantic relations between Europe and the US are the foundation of our security,"" Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky told Reuters.

""Europe must invest more in its own security, but I do not see that as an obstacle or a limit for cooperation with the USA,"" he said via a spokesman.

A senior diplomat from Central and Eastern Europe, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: ""President Macron is not speaking for Europe or the European Union. He is unwittingly helping Beijing to dismantle transatlantic unity at the time of war in Europe, when it is most needed.""

Marcin Przydacz, a foreign policy adviser to Polish President Andrzej Duda, made clear Warsaw was not in favour of any shift away from Washington.

""We believe that more America is needed in Europe,"" he told Polish broadcaster Radio Zet. He added pointedly: ""Today the United States is more of a guarantee of safety in Europe than France.""

Such criticism prompted French officials and diplomats to stress that Macron did not suggest Europe should be equidistant geopolitically from Washington and Beijing, simply that Europe's interests will sometimes differ from those of the United States.

The French foreign ministry cancelled a planned debrief on the trip for foreign diplomats in Paris on Tuesday as officials scrambled to make sure they had a consistent message and to limit any fallout with Washington.

The initial response from Washington was measured. Without directly addressing Macron's comments, the US State Department spokesperson and the White House lauded the bilateral relationship with Paris and its role in the Indo-Pacific region and Ukraine. But there was broader unease.

If Europe doesn't ""pick sides between the US and China over Taiwan, then maybe we shouldn't be picking sides either [on Ukraine],"" US Republican Senator Marco Rubio said in a video drawing parallels with the conflict in Ukraine.","Macron's comments came in an interview on a trip to China that was meant to showcase European unity on China policy, with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen also taking part, but highlighted differences within the European Union.

https://www.malaymail.com/news/sports/2023/04/12/djokovic-labours-to-win-tsitsipas-advances-in-monte-carlo/64375,"Djokovic labours to win, Tsitsipas advances in Monte Carlo","MONTE CARLO, April 12 — Novak Djokovic made a winning return to competition in the Monte Carlo Masters yesterday but was made to work by his 198th-ranked Russian opponent as two-time defending champion Stefanos Tsitsipas advanced when his rival retired injured.

Djokovic is back on court after failing to get a waiver to enter the United States for last month’s Indian Wells tournament and Miami Open due to his anti-Covid vaccination stance.

The world number one was in danger of losing the opening set against Russian qualifier Ivan Gakhov before easing through 7-6 (7/5), 6-2 in 1hr 47min.

“I had never seen him play before today, and it’s always difficult to face an opponent you don’t know,” said the Serbian, a winner on clay in Monte Carlo in 2013 and 2015.

Favourite for a third crown in the Principality in the absence of Rafael Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz, Djokovic will face either 21st-ranked Lorenzo Musetti or Luca Nardi, 159th, both Italian, for a place in the quarter-finals.

Tsitsipas advanced to the third round after Frenchman Benjamin Bonzi retired with a left wrist issue after just 22 minutes, trailing the Greek 4-1 in the first set.

World number three Tsitsipas next meets either Chilean Nicolas Jarry, ranked 58, or Australian Alexei Popyrin, 94th, for a place in the quarter-finals.

‘Ugly tennis’

Djokovic is tuning up for a 23rd Grand Slam bid at the French Open. But the game was not as easy as expected with Gakhov taking the first break to lead 4-3.

Djokovic broke back immediately, but could not prevent the tie-break which he wrapped up on his first set point.

The second set was one-sided even though Gakhov hung on until the end.

“It was probably, if you can call it this way, an ugly tennis win for me today,” said Djokovic, who is looking for a record-extending 39th ATP Masters title this week.

“I haven’t played my best, particularly in the first set. And I kind of expected that that was going to happen in a way with swirly conditions, a lot of wind today, changing directions.

“It’s different practising and then playing an official match on clay.

“But all in all, I’m just pleased with the way I held my nerves I think in the important moments and I managed to clinch the two-set win.”

Rublev, Zverev survive

Earlier Andrey Rublev and Alexander Zverev both survived dropping a set, but last year’s runner-up Alejandro Davidovich Fokina fell at the first hurdle.

Fifth-seeded Rublev, recipient of a first-round bye, rallied to beat Spaniard Jaume Munar 4-6, 6-2, 6-2 in their second-round tie.

German Zverev made a hesitant start to his clay-court season before seeing off Kazakh Alexander Bublik 3-6, 6-2, 6-4 in the first round.

“The feeling was, ‘No way, I might be out in the first round of Monaco’,” said Rublev, 25, who will face fellow Russian Khachanov, Dan Evans or qualifier Ilya Ivashka in the third round.

Zverev was back on clay for the first time since he retired in the French Open semi-finals last year against Rafael Nadal with an ankle injury.

The 13th-seeded German took just under two hours to move past Bublik.

“It felt awful at times to be honest,” Zverev said.

“It usually takes me five or 10 minutes to get used to a clay court, but this year was a bit different. I needed to get the injury out of my head. I needed to get used to sliding again.”

Zverev, a two-time Monte Carlo semi-finalist, will next play Spaniard Roberto Bautista Agut for a place in the third round.

With that data, Nasa will better understand astronauts’ “resource use” on Mars, said Dr Grace Douglas, lead researcher on the Chapea experiments.

“We can really start to understand how we’re supporting them with what we’re providing them, and that’s going to be really important information to making those critical resource decisions,” she said during a press tour of the habitat.

https://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2023/04/12/answered-10-questions-on-how-royal-pardons-work-in-malaysia/64332,Answered: 10 questions on how royal pardons work in Malaysia,"KUALA LUMPUR, April 12 — Former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak is probably the most high-profile prisoner known to be seeking a royal pardon in his criminal case currently, as he hopes for an early release from a 12-year jail term.

How does the pardon process work in Malaysia? Here’s what we know:

1. Who can file a pardon petition and how often can this be done?

When contacted, former Malaysian Bar president Salim Bashir Bhaskaran told Malay Mail that seeking a pardon is considered after a person has exhausted all their legal remedies in court.

He said a petition for pardon can be filed by the prisoner himself, his family or by others on his behalf — such as a foreign embassy. (For example, the Selangor Sultan reduced a Philippine citizen’s death sentence to life imprisonment in 2015, after appeals made by the family and the Philippine embassy.)

Under Regulation 113 of the Prisons Regulations 2000, a prisoner can send a petition on his conviction or sentence once to the Yang di-Pertuan Agong (or the state Ruler or state governor) “as soon as practicable” after his conviction.

The prisoner can send such a petition for pardon for the second time after three years from his conviction date and can subsequently continue to send such petitions every two years, unless there are any “special circumstances”.

Apart from these rules on the frequency for the filing of pardon applications, Salim said there are “no limits” on the number of times it can be filed.

While Umno last Friday said it will appeal to the Yang di-Pertuan Agong for Najib to be pardoned, a 2015 news report cited the Perak Sultan as reminding prisoners to seek for pardons personally instead of forwarding or filing them through a “third party”.

In a written parliamentary reply on November 15, 2016, minister Datuk Seri Azalina Othman Said told Ipoh Barat MP M. Kulasegaran that pardon bids can be filed by a prisoner, his family, his lawyers, non-governmental organisations and the Prisons Department, based on regulations 113 and 114 of the Prisons Regulations 2000.

For prisoners serving jail sentences of more than seven years, the Prisons Department would present a report every four years, and then every year after the 16th year for review on the prisoners’ sentence, in line with Regulation 54, she had said.

Under Regulation 54, the report to be forwarded to the Rulers should include statements on the prisoners’ work, conduct, mental and physical condition and effect of imprisonment on his health, with the Rulers able to decide whether to cut short part of the jail term or grant an early release.

2. Who do you appeal to?

It all depends on where you committed the offence.

Based on the Federal Constitution’s Article 42(1), the Yang di-Pertuan Agong has the power to grant pardon for offences committed within the Federal Territories of Kuala Lumpur, Putrajaya and Labuan, while state Rulers have the power to grant pardon for offences committed in the states.

3. Who sits on the Pardons Board?

Under the Federal Constitution’s Article 42, the Pardons Board for each state comprises Malaysia’s attorney general (AG), the state’s chief minister, and a maximum of three other members appointed by the state ruler or the Yang di-Pertua Negeri. The state Ruler or the Yang di-Pertua Negeri would also preside over the state Pardons Board’s meetings.

For the Federal Territories, the Pardons Board comprises Malaysia’s AG, the Federal Territories minister, and a maximum of three other members appointed by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong. The Yang di-Pertuan Agong chairs meetings of the Federal Territories Pardons Board.

4. Can you submit court judgments for your pardon application?

Salim said prisoners can submit “anything relevant” to the Pardons Board when seeking a pardon and agreed this could include court judgments if “relevant”.

“The Pardons Board can make findings on their own based on the documents available. The applicant is open to submit any documents or evidence to assist YDPA in coming to his decisions,” the senior criminal lawyer said, using the abbreviation for Yang di-Pertuan Agong.

After the Federal Court’s 4-1 decision on March 31, 2023, where Najib failed to challenge his conviction and imprisonment in the case involving SRC International Sdn Bhd’s RM42 million, his lawyer Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah said both the majority and minority judgments would be submitted to the Yang di-Pertuan Agong to support Najib’s pardon bid.

Asked about Najib’s plans to submit these court judgments, Salim confirmed a prisoner can still furnish more documents at a later stage after they have filed a petition for pardon.

“Yes, they can supplement the documents if the decisions are yet to be made by the Pardons Board,” he said.

Najib filed his application for a pardon on September 2, 2022, and no decision has been made yet on his pardon bid.

5. What is the Pardons Board’s role?

Under Article 42(9) of the Federal Constitution, a Pardons Board shall consider any written opinion which the AG may have given, before the Pardons Board gives its advice on any matter.

But Salim said the Yang di-Pertuan Agong and state Rulers “hold ultimate discretion to decide on who, when and how pardons are to be exercised”, and added that the law does not make it mandatory for a Ruler to act on the Pardons Board’s advice.

“The Pardons Board acts only as an advisory body to the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, but the Rulers need not follow the suggestions or advice of the board.

“There is a plethora of case laws suggesting that the Yang di-Pertuan Agong or state Rulers holds special constitutional powers in deciding a pardon application, and His Majesty’s decision is not susceptible or amenable to judicial review,” he said.

This means the Rulers’ decision on whether to grant a pardon for a prisoner cannot be challenged in court.

6. Are prisoners told why their pardon bids are accepted or rejected?

“There are also occasions where Rulers have granted pardons on auspicious occasions. Rulers have wide latitudes to manoeuvre and can take into account or call for anything relevant to His Majesty’s whims,” Salim said.

Salim said the Pardons Board does not have to call prisoners in for any hearing on petitions for pardons, as the Pardons Board can deliberate on its own.

He said the Pardons Board only informs prisoners of the outcome of their petition for pardons but is “not obliged to give reasons” for its decision.

He added that the reasons for pardon bid decisions are “unknown” and that it is at the “complete discretion of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong and Rulers”.

7. How many get pardoned at any one time and what kind of offences did they commit? What factors are considered?

Based on news reports in recent years, prisoners such as those who were on death row for murder, firearms- and drug-related offences have received royal pardons, often in conjunction with events such as the state Ruler’s birthday or coronation.

In 2015, the Johor Pardons Board met on March 5 over 10 death row prisoners’ pardon bids and 13 bids for a review of sentences, with the Johor Sultan on March 20 deciding to pardon a prisoner convicted as a juvenile for murder and to reduce 10 prisoners’ death penalties to life imprisonment.

After the Johor Pardons Board considered 30 pardon bids on November 16, 2015, the Johor Sultan six days later reduced four prisoners’ death penalties to life imprisonment.

The Kelantan Pardons Board met on October 26, 2015 where it considered 37 pardon bids, resulting in the Kelantan Sultan deciding to pardon seven death row prisoners in conjunction with his November 11 birthday celebration. One was released, the remaining six could serve life imprisonment instead.

On November 3, 2020, the Perak Pardons Board considered 12 cases, guided by the Prisons Department’s report and advice of the AG and board members. The Perak Sultan decided two days later to release two prisoners earlier, after being satisfied they had undergone rehabilitation while in prison.

A common thread in the news reports was the state Rulers expressing hope that the prisoners who had been pardoned would use their “second chance” to contribute to their families, community, and country.

In news reports on the Perak Sultan’s royal pardon decisions in 2015 and 2020, it was stated that a pardon or reduction of sentence would be considered when the prisoners who applied had shown remorse, repented, and apologised, and displayed good behaviour while in prison and promised not to repeat their offences and shown determination to start a new life.

In a written parliamentary reply on December 2020, then minister in charge of Parliament and law, Datuk Seri Takiyuddin Hassan told then Sungai Buloh MP R. Sivarasa that the state pardons boards had considered 1,129 applications for pardons during the years 2015 to 2019 with 17.4 per cent or 197 of them involving death row prisoners. But he did not state the outcome of these pardon bids.

8. How quickly can a pardon petition be decided?

Salim said there is “no set of formal guidelines or regulations” to follow for the pardon process but said the Yang di-Pertuan Agong may exercise the power of pardon at any point during a prisoner’s imprisonment.

Based on Salim’s experience, the outcomes for applications for pardons could even be as short as months: “It can be within a short span of two/three months or longer... no time frame to be exact.”

Based on news reports, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong had in conjunction with the National Day celebration on August 31, 2020 pardoned 13 prisoners, who had already spent about 19 years in jail to serve their life sentences since December 2001.

In a rare detailed public look at the pardons process, the Pardons Board met on September 4, 2019 and the Yang di-Pertuan Agong had upon its advice decided to pardon the 13 convicts at a later date.

The Pardons Board met again on July 24, 2020 and the Agong upon its advice consented for the 13 prisoners’ release in August 2020, with the pardon granted due to their good behaviour and with hopes they would turn over a new leaf.

On September 13, 2022, the Malaysian Bar said Najib is entitled to seek a royal pardon, but said he did not deserve to be pardoned at such a juncture as he had at that time only been in prison for less than a month.

The Malaysian Bar had said Najib should first serve more of his 12-year jail term, as public figures in the past — then Opposition politician Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim, former minister Datuk Mokhtar Hashim and former Selangor menteri besar Datuk Harun Idris — had served a “substantial part” of their jail term before they were released on royal pardon. The trio had each served between three and eight years before their pardon.

After becoming a prisoner on August 23, 2022, Najib has so far served more than seven months of his 12-year jail sentence for the SRC case, where he was convicted of criminal breach of trust, power abuse and money laundering.

9. What is the effect of a pardon?

“The effect of pardon is to remove all legal punishments for the offences and to remove any disqualifications under the law,” Salim said.

10. How can the pardons process in Malaysia be improved?

Currently, the dates when the Pardons Board holds meetings are not known to the public, Salim said.

Salim suggested that the Pardons Board meet frequently, adding that the Yang di-Pertuan Agong or Rulers could appoint a “senior criminal lawyer” to be made part of the Pardons Board to provide views.","The Yang di-Pertuan Agong chairs meetings of the Federal Territories Pardons Board.
“Yes, they can supplement the documents if the decisions are yet to be made by the Pardons Board,” he said.
Under Article 42(9) of the Federal Constitution, a Pardons Board shall consider any written opinion which the AG may have given, before the Pardons Board gives its advice on any matter.
Salim said the Pardons Board does not have to call prisoners in for any hearing on petitions for pardons, as the Pardons Board can deliberate on its own.

Lampard got off to a losing start on his return to the hot seat at the club in a caretaker capacity on Saturday, with the Blues beaten 1-0 at Wolverhampton Wanderers.

Chelsea have had a disappointing season and are languishing in 11th place in the Premier League, having sacked manager Graham Potter on April 2 before bringing Lampard back.

“The Premier League is one of the greatest challenges in world football... and those challenges have obviously taken us to a place we don’t want to be as Chelsea,” Lampard told a news conference on Tuesday, ahead of his second game in charge.

“I think the Champions League sometimes offers you a bit of escapism from that - a different speed of game, knockout football, those things can all contribute to getting different success in the same season.

“There’s pressure on both teams due to the size of both clubs. Are Real Madrid favourites? Yes. (But) there’s no better carrot in football than trying to prove people wrong.

“I think that’s a nice challenge for us. I’m not worried about that, in terms of pressure. Football at this level is pressure and if you can’t handle it, you’re not a big club or big player.”

Chelsea are 17 points off the top-four with eight Premier League games left so winning the Champions League is their only realistic road to Europe’s elite competition for next season.

Djokovic, who is not vaccinated against COVID-19, was unable to play at Indian Wells and Miami last month as he failed to obtain a waiver to enter the United States.

He spent the time training on clay ahead of the French Open, where he will target a 23rd Grand Slam, but the Serbian's 7-6(5) 6-2 win over Russian qualifier Gakhov on Tuesday showed he needs more time to get into a rhythm.

""But it's different when you play a match, especially today (Tuesday) was quite windy on the court, so not easy to find the rhythm, to have the ball right, the ball toss and playing a lefty, playing someone that has not much to lose.

https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/russia-plans-electronic-call-up-papers-in-crackdown-on-military-draft-dodgers,Russia plans electronic call-up papers in crackdown on military draft dodgers,"MOSCOW - Russia is poised to introduce electronic military draft papers for the first time in its history in an effort to make it harder for men to avoid being drafted as it seeks to perfect a system it has used to bolster its military forces in Ukraine.

The State Duma, the lower house of Parliament, is due to consider the move – which requires a change in the law – in a session on Tuesday, though government officials say there are currently no plans to compel more men to fight in Ukraine.

Russia says it mobilised just over 300,000 men in 2022 to help it prosecute what it calls its “special military operation”, but is now focused on trying to recruit professional volunteer soldiers via an advertising campaign.

“We need to perfect and modernise the military call-up system,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a regular news briefing on Tuesday, in which he also recalled “problems” experienced in 2022 with the mobilisation campaign.

The initial decision to introduce mobilisation for the first time since World War II prompted tens of thousands of draft-age men to flee abroad, while some protests broke out – and were swiftly suppressed – in multiple Russian cities.

No second mobilisation

Mr Peskov dismissed suggestions that the digitalisation plans might spark a further wave of panic and emigration among young male Russians keen to avoid having to fight in Ukraine.

“(This plan) is not connected to mobilisation,” he said, repeating previous assurances that there were no plans for a second wave of mobilisation.

Under the current system, men targeted by military recruiters are sent paper summons to their registered addresses.

Recruiters have sometimes struggled to confirm whether a summons has been received or not or whether they have the right address for a draftee.

Under the new proposals, summons would be sent electronically to a potential draftee’s personal account on the main government portal. They would be considered delivered as soon as delivered electronically.

Once the electronic summons is received, under the legislation, citizens who fail to show up at the military enlistment office would be automatically banned from travelling abroad.

“The summons is considered received from the moment it is placed in the personal account of a person liable for military service,” Mr Andrei Kartapolov, chairman of the Russian Parliament’s defence committee, said in comments on television.

The Kremlin in 2022 pledged to fix “mistakes” in its initial mobilisation campaign that saw men who were ineligible for the draft due to age or medical conditions being called up to fight in Ukraine.

In a unanimous decision, a three-judge panel chaired by Justice Hadhariah Syed Ismail allowed Ms Sam Ke Ting’s appeal to quash her guilty verdict by the High Court, on grounds that the charge was defective.

“In this case, the charge was incorrect, it was defective. The conviction was also incorrect. On these grounds alone, the appeal is allowed,” Justice Hadhariah said on Tuesday.

The other judges on the panel were Justice Hashim Hamzah and Justice Azman Abdullah.

Justice Hadhariah said a guilty verdict could only follow the finding of fault of the driver.

“That is how the law stands. You cannot simply say that because it is a fatal accident, the driver must have been liable. That is not what the law says,” she said.

Justice Hadhariah then set aside the High Court’s decision and acquitted and discharged Ms Sam.

“You are now a free person,” she said.

The court also ordered for Ms Sam’s RM10,000 (S$3,030) bail money to be returned to her.

Ms Sam is largely seen as a victim of circumstance in Malaysia after crashing into a group of dozens of teenagers racing illegal bicycles – which had been modified by having their brakes and lights removed and handlebars lowered – on a poorly lit road at 3.20am on Feb 18, 2017.

The eight who died were aged between 13 and 16.

Ms Sam was charged with reckless driving and causing deaths, and was previously acquitted twice – by the Magistrates’ Court in 2019 and 2021.

In her lower court trial, it was determined that she had not been driving under the influence of alcohol, was alert at the wheel, and was possibly driving below the speed limit at the time of the crash.

But a second appeal by the prosecution took her to the High Court, where on April 13, 2022, a Johor Bahru High Court judge allowed the prosecution’s appeal and convicted Ms Sam of driving recklessly and sentenced her to six years in jail and a RM6,000 fine.","In a unanimous decision, a three-judge panel chaired by Justice Hadhariah Syed Ismail allowed Ms Sam Ke Ting’s appeal to quash her guilty verdict by the High Court, on grounds that the charge was defective.

A net US$368 million (S$490 million) of Bitcoin was sent to personal wallets in the week through April 4, a period that saw this year’s second-largest net Bitcoin outflow from crypto exchanges, strategists Alkesh Shah and Andrew Moss wrote in a note.

“Investors transfer tokens from exchange wallets to their personal wallets when they intend to hold them (or HODL), indicating a potential decrease in sell pressure,” they said. The abbreviation “HODL” is a crypto sector meme referring to the idea of holding on to tokens for the long term.

Concerns stemming from the US regulatory crackdown on digital asset platforms may have triggered the outflow from exchanges, the BOA strategists wrote in a note published on Monday.

Bitcoin’s year-to-date surge has outstripped major asset classes and sparked a thorny debate on why the largest token is rebounding from a rout in 2022.

Some analysts argue expectations of eventual United States Federal Reserve interest rate cuts are bolstering riskier investments like crypto. Other theories – often disputed – include the coin’s alleged ability to skirt stress in the banking sector or its potential to hedge inflation as a kind of digital gold.

Big week

Bitcoin this week climbed above US$30,000 for the first time since June 2022. The token is up more than 80 per cent since Dec 31, beating the Nasdaq 100 tech index’s 19 per cent gain.

Gold has climbed roughly 9 per cent.

Digital tokens have jumped in 2023 despite aggressive actions by US regulators after the downfall of FTX and other crypto outfits. The rally has come amid a drop in crypto market liquidity and trading volumes following the bankruptcies.

“I am looking for Bitcoin to move towards the US$33,000 level before any meaningful technical correction takes place,” said Mr Nathan Batchelor, managing partner at analytics platform Biyond Trader. “Bitcoin has stopped reacting to bad news. This is a telltale sign of a strong buyers’ market.”

Traders are awaiting another signal to confirm Bitcoin’s breakout, according to Mr Garry Krugljakow, founder of 0VIX, an open-source protocol for lending and borrowing in blockchain-based decentralised finance, or DeFi.

Inflation print

He added that economic data due this week could provide that cue, particularly Wednesday’s US consumer price index.

The median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey calls for a 5.1 per cent jump in March from a year earlier.

“Anything below 5.2 per cent or around 5.2 per cent could lead to a bullish continuation for” Bitcoin, Mr Krugljakow said. “At 5.3 per cent or higher, it will most likely give a slight shock and dampen the current price action.”","NEW YORK – Bitcoin’s stellar 2023 rally may have room to run if flows between cryptocurrency exchanges and personal digital wallets are any guide, according to strategists at Bank of America (BOA).

Speaking to reporters in Malay after the Court of Appeal announced her as innocent of any crimes today, Sam said that although she admitted she was involved in the accident, the accident was not intended by her.

“Every moment my soul and thoughts are haunted by the unfortunate incident that happened that night and I believe I will carry this feeling to the grave,” she said at the Palace of Justice here.

She said that she is aware that her words would not be able to bring back the dead and would not be enough to bring peace to the lives of the families involved.

“For the six years that this case was discussed in court, I always thought and reflected on what kind of daily life and future the deceased could have enjoyed at the sides of their beloved families,” she said.

She then thanked the court and judges for hearing her appeal.

One of Sam's lawyers, Datuk Hisyam Teh Poh Teik, also extended the defence team's condolences to the families.

“As we stand to rejoice and appreciate the Court of Appeal’s judgment, our hearts go out to the victims of the unfortunate tragedy.

“No words can describe the suffering endured by the family members,” he said.

Today's hearing marks the final avenue for the case to be heard, as this case started in the Magistrate's Court — meaning it cannot be appealed further to the Federal Court after a Court of Appeal decision.

The case began in March 2017, and garnered national attention.

The accident in question occurred on March 28, 2017 and involved a car driven by Sam and some 30 youths on their heavily modified bicycles — called “basikal lajak” — on a hilly and dimly-lit road in Johor Baru called Jalan Lingkaran Dalam.","PUTRAJAYA, April 11 — Sam Ke Ting today apologised to the families of the eight teenagers who died after a group involved in an illegal “basikal lajak” street race and her car collided in 2017.

Over the past four decades tombs have been opened, bones have been exhumed from forgotten grave sites and conspiracy theories have abounded in attempts to determine just what became of Emanuela Orlandi.

The daughter of a Vatican usher whose family lived in the Vatican, Orlandi, then 15, failed to return home on June 22, 1983 following a music lesson in Rome.

The case, which has been the subject of on-and-off investigations in Italy and the Vatican, has drawn fresh worldwide attention following the release late last year of the Netflix series Vatican Girl.

In January, Vatican chief prosecutor Alessandro Diddi reopened a previous inconclusive Vatican investigation after he inherited files from his retired predecessor.

Emanuela’s older brother Pietro and the family lawyer, Laura Sgro, were meeting with Diddi in the Vatican today.

In an interview in Corriere della Sera ahead of the meeting, Diddi said Pope Francis wants “the truth to emerge without any reservations”. He said the pope had an “iron will” regarding the case.

Theories about Orlandi’s disappearance have run the gamut. In the 1980s, Italian media speculated she had been kidnapped in an attempt to secure freedom for Mehmet Ali Agca, the Turk jailed in 1981 for trying to assassinate Pope John Paul II, though nothing came of the link and the suggestion faded.

Other reports linked her to the grave of Enrico De Pedis, a mobster buried in a Rome basilica. His tomb was opened in 2012 but nothing was revealed, and in the interview with Corriere della Sera Diddi said the suspected link between the girl’s disappearance and the Rome crime clan had been “over evaluated”.

In 2019, the Orlandi family received an anonymous letter saying Emanuela’s body might be hidden among the dead in the Teutonic Cemetery just inside the Vatican walls where a statue of an angel holding a book reads “Requiescat in Pace,” Latin for “Rest in Peace”.

Two tombs were opened and nothing was found, not even the bones of two 19th century princesses supposed to be buried there. They apparently had been moved during restructuring work decades before Orlandi was born.

In 2018, bones found during ground work at the Vatican embassy in Rome sparked a media frenzy suggesting they might belong to Orlandi or to Mirella Gregori, another teenager who disappeared the same year. DNA tests turned out negative.

Last month, Italy’s lower house approved the establishment of a parliamentary commission to investigate the disappearances of both girls.

Police have never excluded the possibility that Orlandi may have been abducted and possibly killed for reasons with no connection to the Vatican, or been a victim of human trafficking.

She would be 55 now. — Reuters","The daughter of a Vatican usher whose family lived in the Vatican, Orlandi, then 15, failed to return home on June 22, 1983 following a music lesson in Rome.

Clinics are also seeing a spike in patient load but doctors said the jump in cases is expected, now that COVID-19 restrictions have been eased.

Unihealth said last week that each of its clinics has been seeing about 15 to 20 COVID-19 patients per day, up by nearly twofold over the past month.

“Most of the COVID-19 patients that we see in clinics continue to present with mild symptoms,” said Dr Xie Huizhuang, the firm’s medical director.

“Their vitals are stable and they do not require hospital admissions. They are treated symptomatically and they subsequently recover uneventfully.”

To cater to the uptick, the clinic chain has ordered more medication, including COVID-19-targeted treatments.

Over at Phoenix Medical Group, its clinics have also reported twice as many patients in the past two weeks. Similarly, most of the cases were minor and manageable.

Dr Chua Hshan Cher, the group’s medical director, said most patients showed “routine respiratory symptoms”. He typically advises these patients to “go home and rest”, and drink lots of fluids.","CLINICS SEEING MORE CASESClinics are also seeing a spike in patient load but doctors said the jump in cases is expected, now that COVID-19 restrictions have been eased.

“My weapon is a lot more discreet. These are the eyes of the army,” said Oleksandr, a soldier in his 30s with a camouflage helmet and a neatly trimmed beard, pulling out a drone from the pouch.

Oleksandr is the head of an air support unit for the army’s Fifth Brigade, mostly providing reconnaissance and surveillance but also using specially adapted drones to drop grenades.

His mission is to fly drones above the city of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine – scene of the longest battle of the war and current epicentre of the fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces.

When he is not on a mission, Oleksandr is training or fixing his drones.

“We identify the enemy and we can accompany assault units,” he said, clearing branches from a take-off spot for his drone.

In the modern battlefield, drones can update artillery units in real time, effectively replacing the role of spotters who adjust fire to hit targets.

The same is also true for the other side, and drone operators also work to neutralise Russian drones.

Gift from the Russians

Viktor, another member of Oleksandr’s drone unit, keeps the interceptor in a large briefcase.

He shows off its screen with a predatory smile.

“Look, you can see them all! The Mavic and the others! All the drones!” he said.

https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/football/fifa-predicts-2023-womens-world-cup-will-be-watershed-moment,Fifa predicts 2023 Women's World Cup will be 'watershed' moment,"SYDNEY – Fifa has predicted that the 2023 Women’s World Cup in Australia and New Zealand will be a “watershed” moment that propels the game to another level, with the target to eventually rival the men’s version.

Women’s football is already enjoying a surge in popularity in some countries, and the July 20-Aug 20 tournament looks set to spark further global interest.

Fifa’s chief women’s football officer Sarai Bareman told NewsCorp Australia in comments published on Tuesday – as organisers marked a 100-day countdown – that more than two billion viewers were expected to tune in, double the previous tournament in France.

Record attendance is also predicted, with 650,000 tickets already snapped up.

Bareman believes the event would be a major turning point and a driver for social change, creating role models for young girls and helping promote gender equality.

“People will be saying, ‘That was the watershed moment that changed everything and took the game to the next level’,” she said.

“And that’s in every aspect – commercially, participation, popularity and growth.

“I think people will really look back and choose the women’s World Cup in Australia and New Zealand as that watershed moment where the growth, which is already exponential, just took off to the absolute next level.”

Bareman, a New Zealand-born former Samoan international, added that the ultimate goal was to grow the tournament to rival the men’s and get females on equal footing in terms of pay.

“We know the men’s World Cup is the primary source of revenue for Fifa and football, and that generates in excess of US$5 billion (S$6.7 billion) per edition, and that’s a clear target for women’s football,” she said.

“We want to get to that level... we’re still in our infancy as a product.

“But we have to look at what’s happening in the men’s game as an inspiration and a target. For me, it’s got to be in the billions and we have to keep pushing.”

The tournament, which will take place in five Australian and four New Zealand cities, has been expanded from 24 to 32 teams for the first time.

It kicks off with New Zealand facing Norway in Auckland and Australia meeting Ireland in Sydney.

Hopeful the world No. 10 Matildas can have a deep run on home soil, Australia has boosted funding for elite women’s programmes in recent years but officials are still hoping to have better resources to handle an expected rise in grassroots participation.

“Currently, only 40 per cent of football facilities nationwide are classified as female-friendly,” Football Australia said.

“It is imperative that we invest in our 2,400-plus community clubs across the country to ensure they are adequately prepared for the expected surge in female participation, and participation in the sport more broadly.”","SYDNEY – Fifa has predicted that the 2023 Women’s World Cup in Australia and New Zealand will be a “watershed” moment that propels the game to another level, with the target to eventually rival the men’s version.
Women’s football is already enjoying a surge in popularity in some countries, and the July 20-Aug 20 tournament looks set to spark further global interest.

In response to TODAY’s queries, the police said that they received a report on an alleged case of obscene act on Senja Road at 12.10am on April 11 and a male teenager was arrested in relation to the case.

The cat’s owner Ismul Azim, who had earlier posted the video on his Instagram account, said that the incident happened on April 8 at around 1.50am.

In the clip, the boy was seen loitering outside a flat before pulling down his pants and humping the cat from the back.

As the cat tried to crawl away, he grabbed the cat and repeated the act.

Ismul said that his neighbour forwarded the surveillance footage and he made a police report.

He added that the cat showed signs of trauma after the incident.

https://www.straitstimes.com/business/banking/hong-kong-s-za-bank-offers-crypto-conversions-accounts-in-city-s-push,"Hong Kong’s ZA Bank offers crypto conversions, accounts in city’s push","HONG KONG – Hong Kong’s biggest virtual bank is pushing into transfers of crypto and fiat currencies and to provide account services for the city’s burgeoning digital asset sector.

Founded by Chinese billionaire Ou Yaping among others, ZA Bank will offer token-to-fiat currency conversions over licensed exchanges, Mr Ronald Iu, the lender’s chief executive, said in an interview on Tuesday.

ZA will act as a settlement bank for clients to allow withdrawals in Hong Kong, Chinese and United States currencies after they deposit crypto tokens with exchanges, Mr Iu said.

The business model is already in operation with HashKey and OSL, the only two currently licensed crypto exchanges in Hong Kong, Mr Iu said.

ZA Bank will also provide the same service to other exchanges as they become licensed.

“For the dozens of interested firms, big or small, from abroad and local, at the top of their concerns is having a path to make things work,” said Mr Iu.

Hong Kong is going against the current in opening up to the beleaguered sector as it seeks to revive its status as a financial centre following years of Covid-19 restrictions and political upheaval.

But access to banking has been a major hurdle for the city’s ambitions.

The city’s banking and securities regulators will host a round-table for crypto players and bankers to share experiences and perspectives on banking services later in April.

Hong Kong is planning to roll out a revamped virtual asset exchanges framework by June 1 that allows exchange operators to open to retail investors.

The recent collapse of Silicon Valley Bank has further eroded banking access for many crypto firms, as traditional banks have been reluctant to provide services because of strict know-your-customer and anti-money laundering (AML) rules.

ZA Bank is offering online account opening for local Web3 start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises, following a trial in a regulatory sandbox that onboarded about 100 companies.

The bank has linked up to the city’s company registry data, allowing for minimal information input and cross-checking, according to Mr Devon Sin, alternate chief executive of ZA Bank.

ZA Bank currently plans to engage only licensed exchanges and conducts AML scrutiny against the usual checklists to satisfy regulatory requirements.

No AML issues have popped up over the recent months of work, Mr Sin said.

Mr Iu said the lender does not offer services for clients from mainland China, given the restrictions in place there.

Launched officially in March 2020, ZA Bank is one of Hong Kong’s eight licensed virtual banks and had amassed the most in terms of net assets while remaining unprofitable as at 2022.

“It’s too early to say what the revenue model is here,” said Mr Iu. “More clients, more deposit, more business opportunity is always great for the bank.”

The virtual lender does not expect it will need to boost its headcount to handle the the crypto client push, Mr Iu said.

https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/alibaba-unveils-tongyi-qianwen-an-ai-model-similar-to-gpt,"Alibaba unveils Tongyi Qianwen, an AI model similar to ChatGPT, as Beijing flags new rules","SHANGHAI - Alibaba Group Holding on Tuesday showed off its generative AI model – its version of the tech that powers chatbot sensation ChatGPT – and said it would be integrated into all of the company’s apps in the near future.

The unveiling, which came on the heels of the launch of a slew of new AI products by another Chinese firm SenseTime this week, was swiftly followed by the government’s publication of draft rules outlining how generative AI services should be managed.

In a filmed demonstration, the AI large language model, named Tongyi Qianwen which means “truth from a thousand questions”, drafted invitation letters, planned trip itineraries and advised shoppers on types of makeup to purchase.

Tongyi Qianwen will initially be integrated into DingTalk, Alibaba’s workplace messaging app and can be used to summarise meeting notes, write e-mails and draft business proposals. It will also be added to Tmall Genie, Alibaba’s voice assistant.

The technology “will bring about big changes to the way we produce, the way we work, and the way we live our lives”, Alibaba’s chief executive Daniel Zhang told a live-streamed event.

AI models like Tongyi Qianwen are “the big picture for making AI more popular in the future”, he added.

The Chinese internet giant’s cloud unit plans to open Tongyi Qianwen to clients, so they can build their own customised large language models. Registrations for Tongyi Qianwen began on Friday.

The draft rules published by the Cyberspace Administration of China said the country supported the technology’s innovation and popularisation but generated content had to adhere to “core socialist values” as well as to laws on data security and personal information protection.

Those who fall afoul of the rules could face fines or criminal investigation, it added.

The proposed rules, open for public feedback until May 10, come as governments around the world are looking at how best to regulate generative AI technology, which has sparked much concern about its ethical implications as well as its impact on national security, jobs and education.

Italy last month temporarily banned ChatGPT, the chatbot sensation developed by Microsoft-backed OpenAI that has sparked the run of companies developing similar products.

In an open letter citing potential risks to society, Tesla founder Elon Musk and a group of artificial intelligence experts and industry executives have also called for a six-month pause in developing systems more powerful than OpenAI’s newly launched GPT-4.

Mr Charlie Chai, an analyst from 86Research, said Beijing’s new rules would potentially slow down progress “in exchange for a more orderly and socially responsible deployment of the technology”.

They would also set up obstacles for foreign companies looking to provide AI services in the country, benefiting domestic companies, he added.

Global interest in generative AI, which learns from past data to create new content, has surged since the release of ChatGPT late last year.

A number of Chinese companies have revealed or teased AI models and chatbots.

Search giant Baidu announced its Ernie Bot chatbot earlier in 2023. The bot remains open only to trial users as of April.

On Monday, Chinese AI company SenseTime unveiled a slew of new AI products, including a chatbot called SenseChat.

Mr Zhang said that Alibaba and other companies working on AI models were at the “starting line” of a new phenomenon.

“Seizing this opportunity is a common wish for all of us,” he said.

Shares in Alibaba rose 1.5 per cent in Hong Kong trade, while the broader market was flat. Shares in SenseTime initially surged but were later down 2.7 per cent.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/man-city-thrash-bayern-3-0-haaland-reaches-another-milestone-3411386,Man City thrash Bayern 3-0 as Haaland reaches another milestone,"MANCHESTER, England: Rodri struck a wonder goal and Erling Haaland set another scoring record as Manchester City beat Bayern Munich 3-0 on Tuesday (Apr 11) to continue their quest for a first-ever Champions League title in their quarter-final first leg.

Haaland, who scored City's third goal of the night in the 76th minute, has 45 goals in all competitions, a single-season record for a Premier League player, moving ahead of Mo Salah and Ruud van Nistelrooy.

Rodri put Pep Guardiola's team ahead in the 27th minute, cutting the ball back to beat midfielder Jamal Musiala and curling a blistering long-range shot into the top left corner beyond the outstretched hand of Yann Sommer.

""I know that this Bayern team is special,"" said Guardiola, who managed Bayern from 2013-16. ""We got a good result, but we need two strong games. Anything can happen at Allianz Arena. I know that because I was at Bayern for three years.""

Rodri celebrated with a long knee slide on the rain-soaked turf at the Etihad, while Bayern's new manager Thomas Tuchel threw up his hands in disgust en route to his team's biggest defeat in the Champions League since a 3-0 loss to Paris St Germain in 2017.

""It was very special for me to score my first goal in the Champions League. At that moment we were struggling because they are a great, great team,"" Rodri told BT Sport.

""Sometimes we understand we cannot have 80 per cent possession. They play too. We scored three and could score four but it is a great result.""

What had been an evenly matched game turned thoroughly in City's favour midway through the second half, and Bernardo Silva scored their second in the 70th minute, heading in a cross from Haaland. The Norwegian got a goal of his own six minutes later, striking from close range.

""This never happens to Bayern Munich but credit to Manchester City, they were brilliant in both boxes,"" former Bayern player Owen Hargreaves said on BT Sport. ""Pep had a game plan and it worked beautifully.""

Sommer had a busy night and was pressed into action early, almost gifting Haaland a goal in the 14th minute. Taking too long to clear the ball, the striker bulldozed in and got his foot on the ball two yards from the net, but it flew wide.

City midfielder Ilkay Gundogan had a brilliant chance in the 34th minute, but Sommer, who was on the ground, stuck a leg out to save what looked like a certain goal.

Ruben Dias's flick in the second half looked bound for the net, but Sommer tipped it over the crossbar. However, he was helpless to stop Silva and then Haaland from completing the win.

Guardiola faced a familiar foe in Tuchel, who was Chelsea manager when they triumphed over City in the final in 2021.

The Spaniard has won four Premier League titles, one FA Cup and four League Cups at City but European success has eluded the manager who won the trophy twice when in charge of Barcelona.

His confidence will be high that he can end that drought ahead of the second leg, which takes place on April 19 at Munich's Allianz Arena.

""We don't think it is done. They are a good team and we are happy with the performance but we will have to try to win the game,"" Rodri added.","""I know that this Bayern team is special,"" said Guardiola, who managed Bayern from 2013-16.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/taiwan-determined-safeguard-freedom-democracy-president-tsai-ing-wen-3411891,"Taiwan determined to safeguard freedom, democracy, President Tsai says","TAIPEI: Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen said on Wednesday (Apr 12) that her recent overseas trip, which included the United States, showed the world Taiwan's determination to defend freedom and democracy, even as it prompted China to stage war games around the island.

Tsai met US House of Representatives Speaker Kevin McCarthy in Los Angeles last week at the end of her tour, which included stops in Guatemala and Belize.

An infuriated China, which views democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory with no right to the trappings of a state, launched military drills around the island starting on Saturday.

""Through this trip we again sent a message to the international community that Taiwan is determined to safeguard freedom and democracy which won acknowledgment and support from our democratic partners,"" Tsai said as she met Canadian lawmakers at her office in Taipei.

""Faced with continued authoritarian expansionism it is even more critical for democracies to actively unite,"" she added. ""Canada is a very important democratic partner. We are willing to do our utmost to jointly safeguard the values of freedom and democracy with Canada and many more like-minded international partners.""

Despite the tensions with China, Tsai looked relaxed as she greeted the 10 Canadian legislators, even cracking a joke after the interpreter said ""bonjour"", the French word for hello, in translating her opening remarks into English.

""That's French!"" she said in English, smiling and pointing to the interpreter, as the lawmakers chuckled.

Despite China announcing the three days of drills had ended as scheduled on Monday, Beijing has continued military activities around Taiwan.

Taiwan's defence ministry said on Wednesday morning that in the previous 24 hours it had detected 35 Chinese military aircraft and eight navy vessels around Taiwan.

Of those aircraft, 14 had crossed the median line of the Taiwan Strait, according to a ministry-provided map; the line normally serves as an unofficial barrier between the two sides.

The aircraft crossing the median line included five Su-30 fighters at its northern end, with the other planes crossing at points in the centre and south.

Although Chinese fighters previously only occasionally crossed the median line, the country's air force has done so regularly since staging war games near Taiwan in August, after a visit to Taipei of then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

China says it does not recognise the existence of the line.

Taiwan's government strongly rejects China's sovereignty claims and says only Taiwan's people can decide their future.","""Through this trip we again sent a message to the international community that Taiwan is determined to safeguard freedom and democracy which won acknowledgment and support from our democratic partners,"" Tsai said as she met Canadian lawmakers at her office in Taipei.

https://www.malaymail.com/news/money/2023/04/12/wall-street-ends-mixed-as-inflation-data-comes-into-focus/64357,Wall Street ends mixed as inflation data comes into focus,"NEW YORK, April 12 ― Wall Street stocks ended mixed yesterday, losing steam late in the session as investors awaited crucial inflation data and the unofficial kick-off of first-quarter reporting season.

The Dow closed in positive territory with economically sensitive sectors such as industrials, materials and transports providing a boost, while tech and tech-adjacent megacap stocks pulled the Nasdaq to a lower close.

The bellwether S&P 500 ended essentially unchanged.

“When you see cyclicals leading, that is saying that recession worries could be somewhat overblown,” said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group in Omaha. “That's a healthy sign, what you wouldn't expect to see if we were headed straight for recession.”

Stocks briefly gained momentum in the afternoon as Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee urged caution, warning that the Federal Reserve needs to be careful about raising rates too aggressively in its efforts to tame inflation.

With a lack of market moving catalysts, investors looked ahead to Wednesday's consumer price index (CPI) for any evidence that the long, slow inflation cooldown continues.

“It's the calm before the storm,” Detrick added. “With huge inflation data tomorrow, Fed minutes coming out soon and earnings right around the corner, traders are taking a wait and see approach to see how the inflation data comes in.”

On a monthly basis, analysts see headline and core CPI cooling to 0.2 per cent and 0.4 per cent, respectively. But year-on-year, while consensus estimates call for a significant drop in the headline number ― to 5.2 per cent from 6.0 per cent ― the core measure, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, is expected to gain heat, rising to 5.6 per cent from 5.5 per cent.

As inflation slowly cools to the Fed's average annual 2 per cent target, market participants are banking on a 67 per cent likelihood of another 25 basis point interest rate hike at the conclusion of its May monetary policy meeting, according to CME's FedWatch tool.

“(The) 25 basis point hike is probably going to happen, and is baked into stock prices,” said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth in Fairfield, Connecticut. “How they position it for the next meeting is key, because so many people are expecting a downturn in the economy.”

Beyond CPI, investors are eyeing first-quarter reporting season, which surges from the starting gate on Friday with results from three major banks, Citigroup Inc, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Wells Fargo & Co.

Analysts expect aggregate first-quarter S&P 500 earnings falling 5.2 per cent year-on-year, a stark reversal from the 1.4 per cent annual growth seen at the beginning of the quarter.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 98.27 points, or 0.29 per cent, to 33,684.79; the S&P 500 lost 0.17 points, essentially flat, at 4,108.94; and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 52.48 points, or 0.43 per cent, to 12,031.88.

Among the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, communication services and tech ended in the red, while energy and financials enjoyed the largest percentage gains.

Cryptocurrency-related shares such as Coinbase Global Inc, Riot Platforms Inc and Marathon Digital Holdings Inc climbed between 6 per cent and 17 per cent as bitcoin broke through the US$30,000 (RM132,533) level for the first time in 10 months.

CarMax Inc surged 9.6 per cent after the used-car retailer posted a consensus-beating quarterly profit.

Drugmaker Moderna Inc slipped 3.1 per cent after the company said its closely watched flu vaccine failed to meet the criteria for “early success” in a late-stage trial.

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 3.04-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.49-to-1 ratio favoured advancers.

In a Facebook post on Saturday, the Marion County Sheriff’s Office said it received a call for help on April 7 from a fisherman at the Lake O’ the Pines in Marion County, East Texas – an area for fishing, boating and other recreational activities, with a maximum depth of 15m.

“He reported observing a black jeep submerged about forty feet from the Woody’s Camp boat ramp,” said the post.

Photos shared by the Sherriff’s Office showed most of the jeep was submerged, with only its black roof visible.

Local authorities and recovery services arrived at the scene and as they were preparing to remove the jeep from the water, they noticed a person was inside and moving.

“With the assistance of the wrecker service, fisherman, and Marion County deputies, a female was safely rescued from the submerged jeep,” said the post.

The fisherman who made the call to the police used his boat to help a tow-truck worker get close to the jeep and hook up a tow cable, Captain Chuck Rogers, an investigator at the Sherriff’s Office told US radio broadcaster NPR.

The woman was then taken to a local hospital for further treatment by paramedics, added the post.

Authorities later determined that the woman had been reported missing since April 5, according to a report by The Guardian.

Her identity has not been made known to the public.

It is not known how long the jeep had been submerged in the water, said Mr Rogers.

“There was nothing uncovered during the investigation to suggest this case was anything more than an accident,” he added.","A woman in the United States was found alive in a vehicle that was submerged in a lake, two days after she was reported missing.
